J	Cardoso, GPD; de Carvalho, PHP; Gondim, PRD				de Freitas Cardoso, Gabriel Pimenta; Portela de Carvalho, Paulo Henrique; de Lira Gondim, Paulo Roberto			Deep reinforcement learning for resource allocation of mobile communication systems with device-to-device underlay	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						D2D; DDPG; deep reinforcement learning; emerging mobile systems; resource allocation; TD3		Over the past few decades, the number of users and services of the mobile communications system has considerably increased, and since its essential resources such as spectrum and energy are limited, their optimization has drawn particular interest. Concomitantly, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have advanced and their applications have been expanded, including problems of classification, regression, and optimization of tasks of mobile communications systems. Regarding fifth and sixth generations of such systems, the insertion of AI is foreseen toward the allocation of available resources. The present study applied two recently proposed techniques based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms (viz., deep deterministic policy gradient [DDPG] and twin-delayed DDPG [TD3]), for the power control and spectrum allocation of a mobile communications system with device-to-device (D2D) underlay communications. The results show that both algorithms have superior performance to the three algorithms used for comparison: A random algorithm, a greedy algorithm, and REINFORCE, a classical reinforcement learning algorithm. Furthermore, the results show the proposed algorithms have good generalization capability and performed the allocation intelligently, taking into account the relationship between distances separating devices and interference between communications. The results also proved robust in terms of small variations in input data and noise.

The goal is to construct a state function that enables the classification of the states of components in one of two categories, that is, failure and operative, in case of dealing with a large number of units in the system. To this end, it is proposed a new algorithm that combines a factor analysis algorithm (unsupervised learning) with local-logistic and isotonic regression (supervised learning). The reliability function is estimated and system failures are predicted in terms of the variables in the original state space. The dimensions in the latent state space are defined by blocks of units with a certain dependence structure. The flexibility of the model allows quantifying locally the effect that a particular unit has on the system performance and a ranking of components can be obtained under the philosophy of the Birnbaum importance measure. The good performance of the proposal is assessed by means of a simulation study. Also a real data case is considered to illustrate the method.

Evaluation of the significance of keratinized mucosa on peri-implant tissue health: a prospective clinical trial	AUSTRALIAN DENTAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Clinical study; dental implant; oral mucosa; tissue grafting	DENTAL IMPLANTS; FOLLOW-UP; PERIIMPLANT; DISEASE; WIDTH	BackgroundThe effect of keratinized mucosa on peri-implant tissue health is still inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the importance of keratinized mucosa and investigate the impact of the free gingival graft procedure on peri-implant health. MethodsAt prosthesis delivery, the implants were allocated into three groups, based on the width of keratinized mucosa (KM) and patients' agreement on the free gingival graft procedure: KMS (KM >= 2 mm), KMD (KM <2 mm), and FGG (KM <2 mm initially and having surgically increased keratinized mucosa). Modified plaque index (mPI), probing depth (PD), modified bleeding index (mBI), KM, and marginal bone loss (MBL) were assessed at the baseline, 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-up periods. ResultsOf the 47 patients, 17 belonged to the KMS group, 17 belonged to the KMD, and the remaining 13 patients belonged to the FGG. KMD demonstrated significantly fewer mPI and higher mBI than KMS and FGG at 6 and 12 months. At 24 months, MBL did not differ between the groups; however, PD was significantly greater in the KMD group. ConclusionsImplants with inadequate keratinized mucosa had higher bleeding and pocket depth values despite less plaque accumulation. According to the results, soft tissue grafting should be performed as early as possible. (c) 2023 Australian Dental Association.

Gwanggyo, located in Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do. S. terricola FBCC-A190 is a thin and simple filament with a cell length that is longer than its width. It has a thin and firm sheath, exhibiting a blue-green color. Species belonging to genus Stenomitos is semi-cryptic species with slight morphological differences from each other. They were confirmed as Stenomitos species by analysis using 16S rRNA and 16S-23S ITS. A monophyletic cluster was formed with the previously reported genus Stenomitos, with 16S rRNA gene sequences sharing similarities of 95.9-97.9% except for S. pantisii TAU-MAC 4318. In addition, 16S-23S ITS gene sequencing showed tRNA(Ala), tRNA(Ile) and V2, similar to the previously reported genus Stenomitos. From these results, Stenomitos terricola sp. nov. was proposed as a new species belonging to genus Stenomitos.

The single immune adjuvant failed to show the expected clinical therapeutic efficacy due to its rapid drug metabolism and inability to accumulate in the tumor site efficiently. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a new anti-tumor strategy combined with immune adjuvants. It can provide tumor-associated antigens, activate dendritic cells, and attract lymphoid T cells into the tumor microenvironment. Here doxorubicin-induced tumor membrane-coated iron (II)-cytosine-phosphate-guanine nanoparticles (DM@NPs) are shown for efficient co-delivery of tumor-associated antigens and adjuvant. Higher expression of ICD-related membrane proteins on the surface of the DM@NPs leads to the enhanced uptake of DM@NPs by dendritic cells (DCs), thereby promoting the DCs maturation and pro-inflammatory cytokines release. DM@NPs can remarkably increase the T cell infiltrations, remodel the tumor immune microenvironment and inhibit tumor progression in vivo. These findings reveal that pre-induced ICD tumor cell membrane-encapsulated nanoparticles can enhance immunotherapy responses and provide an effective biomimetic nanomaterial-based therapeutic strategy for lung cancer.

Herein, the first steps are taken toward the construction of artificial organelles for mimicking cell communication by docking and undocking of cargo in the membrane of swollen artificial organelles. Stimuli-responsive and crosslinked polymeric vesicles are used to allow docking processes at acidic pH at which ferrocene units in the swollen membrane state can undergo desired specific host-guest interaction using beta-cyclodextrin as model cargo. The release of the cargo mediated by two different enzymes, glucose oxidase and alpha-amylase, is investigated, triggered by distinct enzymatic undocking mechanisms. Different release times for a useful transport are shown that can be adapted to different communication pathways. In addition, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments further support the hypotheses of host-guest inclusion complexation formation and their time-dependent breakdown. This work paves a way to a platform based on polymeric vesicles for synthetic biology, cell functions mimicking, and the construction of multifunctional cargo delivery system.

However, data evaluating treatment efficacy are limited. MethodsThe subjects of this retrospective cohort study were 186 consecutive Japanese cases with fatty liver diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. Treatment efficacy and predictive factors of "Hospitalization Program for Improvement Purpose for Fatty Liver" as a combined diet and aerobic and resistance exercise program were evaluated according to the hospitalization group (153 cases) or the no hospitalization group (33 cases). To balance the confounding biases, treatment efficacy was evaluated using propensity score-matched analysis. In the hospitalization group, a diet of 25-30 kcal/kg multiplied by ideal body weight (BW) daily and aerobic and resistance exercise (exercise intensity of 4-5 metabolic equivalents daily, respectively) were performed for 6 days. ResultsIn liver function tests and BW at 6 months compared with baseline, the rates of decrease of the hospitalization group (24 cases) were significantly higher than those of the no hospitalization group (24 cases), using propensity score-matched analysis. In markers of glycolipid metabolism and ferritin levels, the rates of the hospitalization group were not different from those of the no hospitalization group. In the hospitalization group (153 cases), multivariate regression analysis identified the etiology of non-NAFLD, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and large waist circumference as independent predictors of decreased rates of hemoglobin A1c levels. ConclusionThe diet and exercise program for fatty liver improved liver function tests and BW. Further study should be performed to develop a feasible and suitable program.

However, most of the reported electronic skin systems lack the capability to process and interpret the sensor data. Herein, a new design of artificial perceptual system integrating ZnO-based synaptic devices with Pt/carbon nanofibers-based strain sensors for stimuli detection and information processing is presented. Benefiting from the controllable ion migration after indium doping, the device can emulate various essential functions, such as short-term/long-term plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation, excitatory post-synaptic current, and synaptic plasticity depending on the number, frequency, amplitude, and width of the applied pulses. The Pt/carbon nanofibers-based strain sensors can detect subtle human motion and convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, which are further processed by the ZnO devices.

J	Chen, HY; Feng, YH; Chen, CY; Yu, SC				Chen, Hongyun; Feng, Yinhua; Chen, Changying; Yu, Songcheng			Both early and late maternal age at childbirth is associated with increasing odds of central obesity in offspring	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE; ABDOMINAL OBESITY; PATERNAL AGE; INSULIN; HYPERINSULINEMIA; RISK; CHILDHOOD; PROFILES; DELIVERY; ADULTS	ObjectiveDespite studies on offspring obesity and delayed parenthood, little attention has been paid to the central obesity of offspring. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that maternal age at childbirth (MAC) was associated with central obesity in offspring among the adult population, and fasting insulin may play a role in this association as a mediating factor. MethodsA total of 423 adults (mean age 37.9 years, 37.1% female) were included. Information about maternal variables and other confounders was collected by face-to-face interview. Waist circumference and insulin were determined through physical measurements and biochemical examinations. Logistic regression model and restricted cubic spline model were used to analyze the relationship between MAC and central obesity of offspring. The mediating effect of fasting insulin levels on association between MAC and offspring waist circumference was also analyzed. ResultsThere was a nonlinear relationship between MAC and central obesity in offspring. Compared with subjects with MAC 27-32 years, those with MAC 21-26 years (OR = 1.814, 95% CI: 1.129-2.915) and MAC >= 33 years (OR = 3.337, 95% CI: 1.638-6.798) had higher odds to develop central obesity. Offspring fasting insulin was also higher in MAC 21-26 years and MAC >= 33 years compared with those with MAC 27-32 years. Taking the group MAC 27-32 years as reference, the mediating effect of fasting insulin levels on the waist circumference was 20.6% and 12.4% for MAC 21-26 years and >= 33 years, respectively. ConclusionMAC 27-32 years has the lowest odds of central obesity in offspring. Fasting insulin levels may have a partial mediating effect on the association between MAC and central obesity.

J	Csapo, M				Csapo, Marika			Does conditioning cash transfers on health treatment harm the health of other families on low incomes who depend on public services? Evidence from Brazil	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						Brazil; conditional cash transfers; health systems; infant mortality; Latin America; policy spillovers; primary care	BOLSA-FAMILIA; INFANT-MORTALITY; TRANSFER PROGRAM; NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; CHILD HEALTH; PRIMARY-CARE; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; CONSUMPTION; EXPANSION	MotivationCash transfers have become popular for relieving poverty in the Global South. Many programmes are conditional on beneficiaries complying with medical check-ups, nutritional assessments, and vaccinations. Such conditions may improve the health of beneficiaries, above all the health of their young children. But often public health provision is strained. Might the increased attention to those getting the transfers reduce health services to non-beneficiaries, and especially those on low incomes who cannot afford private medicine? PurposeWhat are the impacts of the largest and longest-lived conditional cash transfer programme in the world, Brazil's Bolsa Familia (BF), on the health of non-beneficiaries living in poverty? Does the health of non-beneficiaries suffer when BF requirements come into place? Do the health requirements of BF lead to increased administrative costs for local health centres? Do they squeeze remaining resources for health care? Methods and approachSurveys from before and after the creation of BF are used to model the probability of death for infants born into poor households, comparing those enrolled in BF to those not included. The impacts of the BF programme on local health budgets are modelled through regression analysis. The analysis takes advantage of the varying degree of coverage of BF at the level of municipalities across Brazil. FindingsImplementation of BF led to lower risk of death of infants from beneficiary families than predicted by trends before BF, while infants from impoverished non-beneficiary families developed a higher-than-expected risk of death. The benefits to the former group were larger than the harm to the latter group, which explains why BF appears to reduce infant and child mortality in aggregate. The expansion of BF depressed local spending on primary health care. Above all, more of the health budget and staff time was spent on monitoring compliance with health conditionalities. Policy implicationsThe harmful spillovers from BF to the health of low-income households who were not included in the programme pose questions about the conditions that often accompany cash transfer programmes. In cases like Brazil, where budgets for public health care are limited, unconditional transfers might be preferable. Or, if health conditions are applied to cash transfer beneficiaries, then extra resources need to be granted to health centres to allow them to deal with the increased demand from beneficiaries for services.

This paper sheds light on this tension through the study of the dynamics of openness and formal appropriability over time and the impact of combining openness and formal appropriability mechanisms (FAMs) on innovation performance. Using a longitudinal panel sample of Spanish start-ups during a period of ten years, it is found that start-ups change their openness and formal appropriability strategies over their development and that a combination of openness and formal appropriability enhances start-ups' innovation performance. This combinative strategy is more relevant for start-ups during the early years of start-up growth, and if they have a high R & D intensity. The study contributes to literature that analyses the trade-off between openness and appropriability, and bridges entrepreneurship and open innovation literatures, providing valuable implications for managers.

In this aspect, removal of trace impurities from one purification stage to the next is frequently stressed throughout the synthesis of photoactive OPV materials and NFAs to obtain the highest-purity material. However, detailed studies of the effect of purification on device performance are less reported. Herein, the role of NFA trace impurities on the optoelectronic characteristics and lifetime of resulting OPV devices is studied. The optimization of PBDB-T:ITIC-X devices, with various ITIC purity levels (X), has been thoroughly studied via a combination of photophysical, chemical, morphological, electrical, and optical characterization techniques, to shine light on the role of these impurities on device performance and lifetime. The findings suggest that, even in materials with larger concentrations of trace impurities, careful tuning can produce high efficiencies. Interestingly, the less-pure materials lead to longer device lifetimes along with an enhancement in accumulative power generation by a factor 3, compared to the purest ITIC-based devices. This demonstrates that selecting a material with the highest purity may not always be the best option for NFA OPV and that any positive effects of NFA purification must be carefully considered in light of both the device efficiency and stability.

Specifically, drugs termed as functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs) have proved to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication using different types of cells. Those therapeutic agents share several chemical structure characteristics and some well-known representatives are fluoxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, and others. Most of the FIASMAs are primarily used as effective therapeutic agents to treat different pathologies, therefore, they are natural drug candidates for repositioning strategy. In this review, we summarize the two main proposed mechanisms mediating acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) inhibition and how they can explain the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by FIASMAs. The first mechanism implies a disruption in the lysosomal pH fall as the endosome-lysosome moves toward the interior of the cell. In fact, changes in cholesterol levels in endosome-lysosome membranes, which are associated with ASM inhibition is thought to be mediated by lysosomal proton pump (ATP-ase) inactivation. The second mechanism involves the formation of an extracellular ceramide-rich domain, which is blocked by FIASMAs. The ceramide-rich domains are believed to facilitate the SARS-CoV-2 entrance into the host cells.

This article looks at deportation through exiting the European Union, an event that was interpreted as regaining sovereignty from the supra-national organisation. New immigration regulations in the United Kingdom were meant to end the EU Freedom of Movement and equalise the statuses of EU- and non-EU migrants in the United Kingdom. The research question this article addresses is the following: how do the new immigration regulations and policies affect the possibility of deportations of EU citizens in the United Kingdom? With the lens of Interpretive Policy Analysis, the article analyses primary sources and expert interviews. It concludes that the deportability of EU citizens has increased post-Brexit. It also anticipates that the deportability of EU citizens will be differentiated, as rough sleepers, former convicts and irregular migrants may be first to be targeted with deportation.

Alongside this development, Swedish politicians have also initiated ambitious plans that aim to establish the country as "world class" in terms of digitalization. International research shows that women and racialized groups are in a minority in the design processes, that AI facial recognition systems are built with white male faces as the norm, and that digital tools replicate racial injustices. In this paper, we are interested in if, and if so how, gender equality is articulated and thus filled with meaning in national policies on AI and digitalization. The overall aim is to discuss the potential of gender (equality) mainstreaming to challenge systems of privilege in the implementation of AI systems in the public sector. The paper analyses how gender equality is filled with meaning in national policy documents on AI and gender equality. The main findings show that gender equality is turned into a question of lack of knowledge and information, which in turn blocks out an understanding of gender equality as something that is related to gendered power relations.

At present, engineered microorganisms are attracting increasing attention. In this study, we constructed an engineered strain of Clostridium butyricum-GLP-1, a C. butyricum (a probiotic) that consistently expresses glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a peptide-based hormone with neurological advantage) in anticipation of its use in PD treatment. We further investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of C. butyricum-GLP-1 on PD mice models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The results indicated that C. butyricum-GLP-1 could improve motor dysfunction and ameliorate neuropathological changes by increasing TH expression and reducing the expression of alpha-syn. Moreover, we confirmed that C. butyricum-GLP-1 improved microbiome imbalance of PD mice by decreasing the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium at the genus level, improved gut integrity, and upregulated the levels of GPR41/43. Surprisingly, we found it could exert its neuroprotective effects via promoting PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy and attenuating oxidative stress. Together, our work showed that C. butyricum-GLP-1 improves PD by promoting mitophagy, which provides an alternative therapeutic modality for PD.

Here, we found that Brother of the Regulator of Imprinted Sites (BORIS) variant SF2(C2/A4) was highly expressed in high metastatic potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and clinical tumor samples, related to the formation of satellite nodules. Its over expression promoted self-renewal, the expression of tumor stem cell markers, chemoresistance, wound healing rate, invasion and metastasis of HepG2 and Hep3B cells; reinforced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), decreased the expression of E-cadherin and increased N-cadherin and Vimentin. Subcellular localization experiment showed that BORIS SF2(C2/A4) was localized in nucleus and cytoplasm. Further double luciferase reporter gene experiment confirmed that it bound to TWIST1 gene promoter and significantly increased latter expression. BORIS SF2(C2/A4) knock down induced apoptosis of HCCLM3 and PLC/PRF/5 cells, and increased the protein content of cleaved caspase 3. Additionally, BORIS SF2(C2/A4) over expression increased the expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. FGF2 expressed higher in HCC tumor tissues than in paired peri-tumor tissues, and its expression was positively correlated with BORIS SF2(C2/A4). Interestingly, high expression of FGF2 is also associated with the formation of satellite nodules. Moreover, using the medium from BORIS SF2(C2/A4) overexpressed cell lines to coculture hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) line LX-2, the latter could be activated and increased the expression of CD90 and PIGF, which is consistent with the effect of adding bFGF alone. These results indicate that BORIS SF2(C2/A4) plays a role in deterioration of liver cancer by regulating TWIST1 to induce EMT, and by FGF2 to activate HSCs.

It is important to establish aggressive subgroups of pNENs and identify potential therapeutic targets. Patients with pNEN (322 cases) were included to examine the association between glycosylation biomarkers and clinical/pathological traits. The molecular and metabolic features stratified by glycosylation status were assessed by RNA-seq/whole exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry. A considerable proportion of patients had elevated glycosylation biomarkers (carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19-9, 11.9%; CA125, 7.5%; carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], 12.8%). CA19-9 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.26, P = .019), CA125 (HR = 3.79, P = .004) and CEA (HR = 3.16, P = .002) were each independent prognostic variables for overall survival. High glycosylation group, defined as pNENs with elevated level of circulating CA19-9, CA125 or CEA, accounted for 23.4% of all pNENs. High glycosylation (HR = 3.14, P = .001) was an independent prognostic variable for overall survival and correlated with G3 grade (P < .001), poor differentiation (P = .001), perineural invasion (P = .004) and distant metastasis (P < .001). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was enriched in high glycosylation pNENs using RNA-seq. EGFR was expressed in 21.2% of pNENs using immunohistochemistry and associated with poor overall survival (P = .020). A clinical trial focusing on EGFR expressed pNENs was initiated (NCT05316480). Thus, pNEN with aberrant glycosylation correlates with a dismal outcome and suggests potential therapeutic target of EGFR.

A Dual-Mode Electrochromic Platform Integrating Zinc Anode-Based and Rocking-Chair Electrochromic Devices	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						dynamic light controls; electrochromism; rocking-chair type electrochromic devices; transparent electronics; zinc anode-based electrochromic devices	TUNGSTEN-OXIDE; PRUSSIAN BLUE; SMART WINDOWS; COLOR; STORAGE	The complementary electrochromic device, where the optical transmittance changes upon the flow of cations back and forth between anodic and cathodic electrodes, operates in a rocking-chair fashion if it can inherently self-discharge. Herein, the first demonstration of a dual-mode electrochromic platform having self-coloring and self-bleaching characteristics is reported, which is realized by sandwiching zinc metal within a newly-designed Prussian blue (PB)-WO3 rocking-chair type electrochromic device. It is demonstrated that the redox potential differences between the zinc metal and the WO3/PB electrodes endow the self-color-switching of these electrodes. By employing a hybrid electrolyte of Zn2+/K+, it is further shown that the colored PB-WO3 rocking-chair device is capable of spontaneously bleaching when the anodic and cathodic electrodes are coupled. This dual-mode light-control strategy enables the electrochromic devices to exhibit four distinct optical states with the highest optical contrast of 72.6% and fast switching times (<5 s for the bleaching/coloration processes). Furthermore, the built-in voltage of the dual-mode electrochromic devices not only promotes energy efficiency, but also augments the bistability of the devices. It is envisioned that the broad implication of the present platform is in the development of self-powered smart windows, colorful displays, optoelectronic switches, and optical sensors.

We then extend this classification to timelike Killing vector fields on Lorentzian 3-manifolds, which are automatically nonvanishing. The two key ingredients needed in our classification are the scalar curvature S of g and the function Ric(T,T), where Ric is the Ricci tensor; in fact their sum appears as the Gaussian curvature of the quotient metric obtained from the action of T. Our classification generalizes that of Sasakian structures, which is the special case when Ric(T,T)=2. We also give necessary, and separately, sufficient conditions, both expressed in terms of Ric(T,T), for g to be locally conformally flat. We then move from the local to the global setting, and prove two results: in the event that T has unit length and the coordinates derived in our classification are globally defined on R-3, we give conditions under which S completely determines when the metric will be geodesically complete. In the event that the 3-manifold M is compact, we give a condition stating when it admits a metric of constant positive sectional curvature.

Recently, many global industries have shifted their focus towards product-service system (PSS) to perpetuate in today's competitive market without negatively influencing the environmental detrition and retaining the extended producer responsibility (EPR). Thus, this study will advance an understanding of how I4.0 technologies derivate renewables from waste to create sustainable energy sources rather than consuming virgin resources (normally considered a linear model) from a data management and product lifecycle perspective. This research used the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology to analyse and categorise a literature survey of 126 research articles published over the years (2013-2022). The analysis indicates that the early research is mostly focused on defining the key variables (CE, I4.0 and PSS) and developing various frameworks to promote eco-efficient services and sustainable development using I4.0 technologies and is engineering focused. It is established that two propositions leverage CE; the first one is value co-creation, which enhances perceived value. In contrast, the other one is related to the application of data-driven platforms using I4.0 technologies for sculpting the strategy and other decision support. More studies need to be analysing CE, I4.0 and PSS. To support researchers, managers and policymakers, this study has analysed the applicability of theoretical propositions regarding the application of I4.0 technologies with CE and PSS and presented a theoretical framework for the I4.0-enabled share platform that may be tested using empirical data.

All these features sparked numerous efforts to insert GNRs in nanoelectronics. As a result, synthesis routes with atomic resolution are now a reality. Recently, the rise of heterojunction (HJ) engineering pushed even further the prospects, allowing the blending of different GNRs as building blocks. However, much of the potential behind it remains untouched for some junctions. In this work, the consequences of forming a cove-type GNR (CGNR) HJ by assembling specimens with borders of different zig-zag/armchair ratios are explored. The nanoribbons are simulated using the extended two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with electron-phonon coupling. The findings show that manipulating the junction creates multiple routes for smooth monotonic gap tuning. Moreover, the changes in the hopping mechanism, mobility, and effective mass are reported leading to variations up to 10 000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 0.425 m(e). This work reveals a pathway to expand the modularity of CGNRs through smooth control of the charge carrier's properties. Future applications can explore this feature to design devices with highly specific charge transport characteristics. The study also serves as theoretical background, potentially inspiring new tuning strategies in other GNRs.

The effects of elongational flow upon the elongational rheology, X-ray diffraction patterns, thermal properties, and mechanical properties are investigated. The results show that the elongational viscosity and melt strength of HMSPP are higher than those of PP under elongational flow, whereby HMSPP shows elongational strain hardening behavior, and the migrating of GNPs from the PP to the HMSPP phase is hindered. As a result, the GNPs are constrained to remain at the interface between the two phases. In addition, the elongational force can exfoliate GNPs more effectively, and the orientation of GNPs along the phase interface will reduce the migration rate of GNPs at the interface, while precisely controlling the location of the GNPs at the phase interface. Thus, more thermal conductivity pathways are constructed and, hence, the thermal conductivity of the PP/HMSPP/GNPs composite prepared under elongational flow is higher than that prepared under shear flow. The present work provides a new method for the preparation of highly thermally conductive polymer composites.

Cobalt-ferrocene metal-organic framework (Co-Fc) is a nanoparticle synthetized by ferrocene and cobalt with a stronger Fenton reaction that can locally generate hydroxyl radical and effectively kill tumors. However, tumor cells can remove exogenous substances through autophagy activity to maintain the internal environment homeostasis. Herein, Co-Fc loaded with the classical autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to construct Co-Fc@HCQ nanoparticles is synthetized. The ferrocene in Co-Fc catalyzes the production of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction. The presence of HCQ inhibits the fusion of autophagy vesicles with lysosomes and reduces the scavenging of ROS. In addition, to enhance the tumor targeting effect of Co-Fc@HCQ nanoparticles, oral cancer cell membranes (CM) are extracted from CAL-27 cell line to construct CM@Co-Fc@HCQ nanoparticles with good homologous targeting and immune escape effects. The results prove the good tumor targeting, biosafety as well as the therapeutic effect of CM@Co-Fc@HCQ. In conclusion, via specific tumor targeting and local autophagy-conducted ROS boosting, CM@Co-Fc@HCQ nanoparticles, a smart local delivery chemo-dynamic substance, provide a promising approach for effectively treating OSCC.

BackgroundDentists face a rapidly ageing patient demographic. Practitioner unwillingness to circumvent the attending challenges of care provision prevents older adults from accessing the dental care necessary for better oral and systemic health. Previous studies have reported on dentists' attitudes toward caring for older adults with disabilities; however, these are mostly limited to dependent older adults and exclude frail, community-dwelling older persons. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire. Quantitative data analysis was presented in the form of descriptive statistics, followed by bivariate analyses. ResultsThere were 193 respondents, a response rate of under 9%. Dentists were less willing, confident and involved in the care of older adults with disabilities as the individual's severity of impairments increased. Less than half of respondents were willing to treat individuals with severe disabilities in cooperation (23.3%), swallowing (30.6%), mobility (33.7%) and communication (45.1%). Dentists with training in geriatric dentistry were more willing to provide care. However, younger dentists, general dental practitioners, private practitioners and public sector dentists had specific restraining and driving forces, which further modulated their willingness to provide care. ConclusionsThe current areas of training needs among Singapore dentists are in severe impairments of swallowing, communication, cooperation and mobility. Further geriatric dentistry training may effectively increase dentists' willingness to provide care; however, additional specific targeted interventions are also needed.

Analytical investigation of a triple surrounding gate germanium source metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor with step graded channel for biosensing applications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL MODELLING-ELECTRONIC NETWORKS DEVICES AND FIELDS			English	Article; Early Access						biosensor; gate all around MOSFET; surrounding gate MOSFET; TCAD; threshold voltage; tri-step doping	ELECTRICAL DETECTION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; ALGAN/GAN HEMT; MOSFET; VOLTAGE; FET; NMOSFETS; PROPOSAL; NANOGAP	This paper proposes a compact analytical model and comprehensively investigates the biosensing performance of a novel dielectric modulated triple surrounding gate germanium source metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor with a step graded channel. Solving the 2D Poisson's equation yields an analytical expression of threshold voltage, channel potential, drain current and sub threshold swing. The sensitivity variation in the biosensor has been thoroughly studied by varying different device parameters to investigate its biosensing performance. Graded doping in channel offers enhanced sensitivity than a non-graded doped channel when the doping of the channel is more near the drain end than source end which is due to stronger electric field and gate capacitance. Effect of fill-in factor for different biomolecules on the sensitivity has been thoroughly discussed. Different analytical results show an excellent agreement with the simulations done on SILVACO ATLAS TCAD simulator.

J	Fox, S				Fox, Stuart			Social action as a route to the ballot box: Can youth volunteering reduce inequalities in turnout?	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						voting; turnout; young people; political socialisation; volunteering	POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT; YOUNG-PEOPLE; VOLUNTARY-ASSOCIATIONS; CIVIC EDUCATION; VOTER; TRANSMISSION; PARTICIPATION; MODEL; VOICE	A serious challenge facing Western democracies is the falling propensity of successive cohorts of citizens to vote. Over the last 50 years, newly eligible voters - particularly from poorer backgrounds - have become less likely to vote in their first elections, and more likely to develop habits of non-voting. This trend has prompted greater interest in policies with the potential to increase first-time voter turnout, such as lowering the voting age or compulsory political education. Despite a growing academic interest in volunteering as a means of youth political expression or route to civic revival, however, the promotion of youth volunteering has not been seriously considered as a potential tool to help address generational turnout decline. An extensive literature argues that volunteering can increase first-time voter turnout, but it is hindered by the limited use of panel data and failure to account for confounding and selection effects. It has not, moreover, considered the potential for the effects of childhood volunteering to be conditional on prior political socialisation, particularly the influence of parents, which is necessary to assess its potential to reduce turnout gaps reflecting socio-economic status. This study uses the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study and structural equation modelling to overcome these limitations and examine the impact of childhood volunteering on the turnout of newly eligible voters. It shows that for most young volunteers there is no significant benefit, but for the children of politically disengaged parents, volunteering does have a significant, positive effect.

To create its benchmark, it is vital to promote in vitro oogenesis using a model physiologically close to humans. Here, we establish a foundation for in vitro oogenesis in cynomolgus (cy) monkeys (Macaca fascicularis): cy female embryonic stem cells harboring one active and one inactive X chromosome (Xa and Xi, respectively) differentiate robustly into primordial germ cell-like cells, which in xenogeneic reconstituted ovaries develop efficiently into oogonia and, remarkably, further into meiotic oocytes at the zygotene stage. This differentiation entails comprehensive epigenetic reprogramming, including Xi reprogramming, yet Xa and Xi remain epigenetically asymmetric with, as partly observed in vivo, incomplete Xi reactivation. In humans and monkeys, the Xi epigenome in pluripotent stem cells functions as an Xi-reprogramming determinant. We further show that developmental pathway over-activations with suboptimal up-regulation of relevant meiotic genes impede in vitro meiotic progression. Cy in vitro oogenesis exhibits critical homology with the human system, including with respect to bottlenecks, providing a salient model for advancing human in vitro oogenesis.

Thin-film transistors (TFTs) with amorphous In0.22Zn delta Sn0.78-delta O1.89-delta (delta = 0.55) channel layers have a reasonable mobility of 41.0 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) due to the synergic intercalation of In and Sn ions. In contrast, TFTs with polycrystalline spinel In0.22Zn delta Sn0.78-delta O1.89-delta (delta = 0.55) channel layers, achieved through a metal-induced crystallization at 300 degrees C, exhibit a remarkably high field-effect mobility of approximate to 83.2 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and excellent stability against external gate bias stress, which is attributed to the uniform formation of the highly ordered spinel phase. The relationships between cation composition, microstructure, and performance for the In2O3-ZnO-SnO2 ternary component system are investigated rigorously to attain in-depth understanding of the roles of various crystalline phases, including spinel Zn2-ySn1-yIn2yO4 (y = 0.45), bixbyite In2-2xZnxInxO4 (x = 0.4), rutile SnO2, and a homologous compound of compound (ZnO)(k)(In2O3) (k = 5). This work concludes that the cubic spinel phase of Zn2-ySn1-yIn2yO4 (y = 0.45) film is a strong contender as a substitute for semiconducting polysilicon as a backplane channel ingredient for mobile active-matrix organic light-emitting diode displays.

Herein, a method to prepare the a-Ge nano-materials with a particle size approximate to 10 nm is proposed by decomposing the CaGe Zintl phase at room temperature. For LIBs, a-Ge has a high-capacity retention of 80% even after 180 cycles (1375 mAh g(-1)). When employed as the anode for SIBs, two-dimensional composites with the a-Ge supported on the graphite nanosheets (a-Ge@GNS) is configured, and a high reversible capacity of 526 mAh g(-1) after 120 cycles is achieved. The preparation of such high-performance amorphous Ge nanomaterials demonstrated in this work is low-cost and environmentally-friendly, and compared with other methods it is especially suitable for scaling-up or mass production.

MethodsThe MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases were used to search for relevant articles. The target population was patients on maintenance hemodialysis (those undergoing hemodialysis for >= 60 days). The defined outcomes were death, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and falls. Meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model of pairwise comparisons of normonatremia and hyponatremia defined for each study, 1-mmol/L increment of sodium analysis, and dose-response analysis using the sodium concentration defined for each study. This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42018087667). ResultsThirteen articles were included. The pairwise analysis revealed that the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.31-1.61). The analysis of 1-mmol/L increment of sodium included six studies with a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.94 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.97) for each 1-mmol/L increase in the serum sodium concentration. In the dose-response analysis, assuming a linear relationship, a sodium increment of 1 mmol/L revealed a hazard ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.98). Other outcomes could not be integrated. ConclusionsHyponatremia is associated with all-cause mortality in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Healthcare providers should pay special attention to even the slightest indication of hyponatremia.

Prior to the clinical tests, in vitro analyses must be performed on the biomaterial surfaces in accordance with the ISO 10993-4 standards. Designing a bio-functional material requires engineering the surface structure and chemistry, which significantly influence the blood cell activity according to earlier studies. In this study, we elucidate the role of surface terminations and polymorphs of SiC single crystals in the initial stage of the contact coagulation. We present a detailed analysis of phase, roughness, surface potential, wettability, consequently, reveal their effect on cytotoxicity and hemocompatibility by employing live/dead stainings, live cell imaging, ELISA and Micro BCA protein assay. Our results showed that the surface potential and the wettability strongly depend on the crystallographic polymorph as well as the surface termination. We show, for the first time, the key role of SiC surface termination on platelet activation. This dependency is in good agreement with the results of our in vitro analysis and points out the prominence of cellular anisotropy. We anticipate that our experimental findings bridge the surface properties to the cellular activities, and therefore, pave the way for tailoring advanced hemocompatible surfaces.

In this study, we have collected experimental data of JAK2 protein containing 6021 unique inhibitors. We then characterized them based on Morgan (ECFP6) fingerprints followed by clustering into training and test set based on their molecular scaffolds. These data were used to build the classification models with various supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms that could prioritize novel inhibitors for future drug development against JAK2 protein. The best model built by Random Forest (RF) and Morgan fingerprints achieved the G-mean value of 0.84 on the external test set. As an application of our classification model, virtual screening was performed against Drugbank molecules in order to identify the potential inhibitors based on the confidence score by RF model. Nine potential molecules were identified, which were further subject to molecular docking studies to evaluate the virtual screening results of the best RF model. This proposed method can prove useful for developing novel target-specific JAK2 inhibitors.

A Conceptual Catalytic Receiver Reactor for Solar Thermal Sulfuric Acid Decomposition	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hydrogen generation; iron oxide catalysts; solar energy storage; solar receiver reactors; sulfuric acid decomposition; thermochemical water splitting	IODINE THERMOCHEMICAL CYCLE; SO3 DECOMPOSITION; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; METAL-OXIDE; TEMPERATURE; EFFICIENCY; FE2O3; SIO2; GENERATION; ENERGY	The highest-temperature step in iodine-sulfur and hybrid-sulfur thermochemical cycles for hydrogen generation is the sulfuric acid decomposition reaction. To efficiently utilize solar energy directly to operate this step, the development of a catalytic solar receiver reactor is essential. A cavity-type reactor coupled to a solar dish and a numerical analysis of the reactor predicting the reaction conversion as a function of the solar absorption coefficient is presented in this study. The catalytic receiver reactor consists of a double-walled quartz cylindrical tube to form the cavity and a flat quartz plate window for entry of the concentrated solar radiation. Two catalysts, Fe1.8Cr0.2O3 and Fe2O3/SiO2, are tested in the solar catalytic receiver reactor and SO2 yields of approximate to 40% and 38% are observed, respectively. Numerical analysis of the reactor is performed and a reaction conversion-absorption coefficient correlation is established. For the catalytic packed bed assuming absorption coefficient of 0.65, a steady-state temperature of 1212 K is achieved, accomplishing an approximate theoretical efficiency of approximate to 56%. The numerical analysis suggests that by utilizing a material of construction with high absorption coefficient, significantly enhanced sulfuric acid decomposition can be achieved by the cavity-type solar receiver reactor.

Herein an intrinsically nonflammable electrolyte is designed by using 1 M lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) in triethyl phosphate (TEP) and N-methyl-N-propyl-pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Pyr(13)][TFSI] ionic liquid (IL) solvents. The introduction of IL can bring plentiful organic cations and anions, which provides a cation shielding effect and regulates the Li+ solvation structure with plentiful Li+-DFOB- and Li+-TFSI- complexes. The unique Li+ solvation structure can induce stable anion-derived electrolyte/electrode interphases, which effectively inhibit Li dendrite growth and suppress side reactions between TEP and electrodes. Therefore, the LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM90)/Li coin cell with this electrolyte can deliver stable cycling even under 4.5 V and 60 degrees C. Moreover, a Li-metal battery with thick NCM90 cathode (approximate to 15 mg cm(-2)) and thin Li-metal anode (approximate to 50 mu m) (N/P approximate to 3), also reveals stable cycling performance under 4.4 V. And a 2.2 Ah NCM90/Li pouch cell can simultaneously possess prominent safety with stably passing the nail penetration test, and high gravimetric energy density of 470 Wh kg(-1) at 4.4 V.

The HRD scores calculated by the panel and whole-genome sequencing were consistent, with the analysis by sequenza being the most reliable. The results on clinical samples revealed that the panel performed better in HRD analysis compared with the SNP microarray. There are several distinctions between this newly developed kit and reported HRD detection panels. First, the panel covers only 52 592 SNPs, which makes it capable of detecting genomic instability. Secondly, all the SNPs are non-exonic; as a result, the panel can be used cooperatively with any exon panel. Thirdly, all the SNPs selected have a high minor allele frequency in Chinese people, making it a better choice for HRD detection in Chinese patients. In summary, this panel shows promise as a clinical application to guide PARP inhibitors or platinum drugs used in the treatment of ovarian and other cancers.

Several methods are available for performing AST including broth microdilution, agar dilution, and disk diffusion. Technological advances such as the development of commercial automated susceptibility testing platforms and the advent of rapid diagnostic tests have improved the rapidity, robustness, and clinical application of AST. Numerous accrediting and regulatory agencies are involved in the process of AST and setting and revising breakpoints, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Challenges to optimizing AST include the emergence of new resistance mechanisms, the development of new antimicrobial agents, and generation of new data requiring updates and revisions to established methods and breakpoints. Together, the challenges in AST methods and their interpretation create important opportunities for well-informed clinicians to improve patient outcomes and provide value to antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the setting of rapidly changing and increasing AMR. Addressing AST challenges will involve continued development of new technologies along with collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory to facilitate optimal antimicrobial use, combat the increasing burden of AMR, and inform the development of novel antimicrobials. This updated primer serves to reinforce important principles of AST, and to provide guidance on their implementation and optimization.

This experiment was monitored from pro-oestrous to met-oestrous phases for correlation of endocrine dependence biochemical constituents in faeces and blood to detection of oestrous biomarkers. Medroxyprogesterone acetate sponges were used for 8 days to bring uniformity of oestrus in sheep. Faeces were collected during different phases of cycle and subjected to determination of fatty acids, minerals, oestrogens and progesterone analysis. Likewise, blood samples were also obtained for enzymatic and no-enzymatic antioxidants. The results revealed that faecal progesterone and oestrogen levels significantly increased during pro-oestrous and oestrous phase, respectively (p < .05). The blood plasma enzymatic levels showed significant demarcation during the oestrous phase than other periods (p < .05). There were also reported marked variations in volatile fatty acids across different phases of the oestrous cycle. Interestingly, methyl octanoate, methyl cis-10 pentadecenoate and methyl heptadecanoate volatiles were found to be specific to oestrus period. In addition, methyl hexanoate, methyl palmitoleate and methyl cis-9 oleate were identified in met-oestrus, indicating their possible role to be an oestrous biomarker. It is concluded that the pattern of volatile compounds and faecal steroids, in association with behavioural patterns, could be measured as a non-invasive method of heat detection in sheep.

The peak areas relative standard deviation (n = 3) and resolution of the four analytes were selected as critical method attributes. Fractional factorial design test combined with Pareto analysis were employed to screen critical method parameters (buffer concentration, pH, sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] micelle concentration, temperature, and voltage). Subsequently, three main factors (buffer concentration, buffer pH, and SDS concentration) were selected by central composite design test for constructing the design space. The optimal separation conditions as follows: capillary column (50.2 cm xm50 mu m, detection length 40 cm). Working background electrolyte consisted of 51 mmol/L borax solution (pH = 9.47) and 40 mmol/L SDS. The samples were injected by pressure (5 s at 0.5 psi) and the detection was performed at 254 nm. Applied voltage was 20 kV and column temperature was 23 degrees C. The developed method is rapid and reliable for the quantitative analysis of four iridoid compounds in RGM, providing a reference for the application of AQbD concept in the analysis of natural products.

L'approche econometrique est basee sur un modele de panel dynamique de 33 pays d'Afrique Subsaharienne et plus specifiquement sur les pays de l'UEMOA couvrant la periode de 2002 a 2019. L'estimateur de la methode des moments generalises (GMM) et celui des moindres carres corriges des variables muettes (LSDVC) sont utilises respectivement dans les deux contextes pour obtenir les resultats. Les resultats revelent que l'integration economique ameliore significativement la croissance sectorielle notamment de l'agriculture et de l'industrie avec un effet plus important pour le secteur agricole. Les resultats montrent egalement que la qualite de la gouvernance ameliore l'effet de l'integration commerciale sur la croissance sectorielle beaucoup plus dans la zone UEMOA. Les resultats montrent egalement un effet significatif de l'investissement et de l'emploi. Ainsi, les decideurs publics dans l'objectif de croissance, doivent mettre en place des mesures d'amelioration de la qualite des indicateurs de la gouvernance.

Microbial necromass carbon (MNC) is an important contributor to stable soil organic carbon pools. However, accumulation and persistence of soil MNC across a gradient of warming are still poorly understood. An 8 -year field experiment with four levels of warming was conducted in a Tibetan meadow. We found that low -level (+0- 1.5 degrees C) warming mostly enhanced bacterial necromass carbon (BNC), fungal necromass carbon (FNC), and total MNC compared with control treatment across soil layers, while no significant effect was caused between high -level (+1.5- 2.5 degrees C) treatments and control treatments. The contributions of both MNC and BNC to soil organic carbon were not significantly affected by warm- ing treatments across depths. Structural equation modeling analysis demonstrated that the effect of plant root traits on MNC persistence strengthened with warming intensity, while the influence of microbial community characteristics waned along strengthened warming. Overall, our study provides novel evidence that the major determinants of MNC production and stabilization may vary with warming magnitude in alpine meadows. This finding is critical for updating our knowledge on soil carbon storage in response to climate warming.

Barcoding, linear and nonlinear analysis of full-day leg movements in infants with typical development and infants at risk of developmental disabilities: Cross-sectional study	INFANCY			English	Article							TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; PRETERM INFANTS; FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; GENERAL MOVEMENTS; VARIABILITY; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM	Traditional methods do not capture the multidimensional domains and dynamic nature of infant behavioral patterns. We aim to compare full-day, in-home leg movement data between infants with typical development (TD) and infants at risk of developmental disabilities (AR) using barcoding and nonlinear analysis. Eleven infants with TD (2-10 months) and nine infants AR (adjusted age: 2-14 months) wore a sensor on each ankle for 7 days. We calculated the standard deviation for linear variability and sample entropy (SampEn) of leg acceleration and angular velocity for nonlinear variability. Movements were also categorized into 16 barcoding states, and we calculated the SampEn and proportions of the barcoding. All variables were compared between the two groups using independent-samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The AR group had larger linear variability compared to the TD group. SampEn was lower in the AR group compared to TD group for both acceleration and angular velocity. Two barcoding states' proportions were significantly different between the two groups. The results showed that nonlinear analysis and barcoding could be used to identify the difference of dynamic multidimensional movement patterns between infants AR and infants with TD. This information may help early diagnosis of developmental disabilities in the future.

Considering the hypothesis that each dimer is obtained through a biosynthetic mechanism that involves the coupling of the corresponding radicals of the single dihydrophenanthrene unit, we identified 29 dihydrophenanthrenes. Of these dihydrophenanthrenes, 11 were new compounds that could be isolated from 10 different plant species; 11 had already been identified, but not yet isolated in the 17 different plant species from which the corresponding dimers had been isolated; and 7 were known and had been isolated in the same plant sources of the corresponding dimers. A targeted analysis of several natural extracts from specific plant sources would allow the identification of known or new molecules with potential and/or specific biological activities and, in a final analysis, would confirm the relative biosynthetic mechanism.

Machine learning algorithms have been employed to quickly identify and classify crop diseases. In this study, we propose a model that integrates a transfer learning approach with a deep Gaussian convolutional neural network model. In this study, two pre-trained transfer learning models were used, that is, MobileNet V2 and VGG16, together with three different kernels: a hybrid kernel (a product of a squared exponential kernel and a rational quadratic kernel), a squared exponential kernel, and a rational quadratic kernel. In experiments using MobileNet V2 and the three kernels, the hybrid kernel performed better, with an accuracy of 90.11%, compared to 86.03% and 85.14% for the squared exponential kernel and a rational quadratic kernel, respectively. Additionally, experiments using VGG16 and the three kernels showed that the hybrid kernel performed better, with an accuracy of 88.63%, compared to the squared exponential kernel's accuracy of 84.62% and the rational quadratic kernel's accuracy of 83.95%, respectively. All the experiments were done using a traditional computer with no access to GPU and this was the major limitation of the study.

Oncolytic viruses have recently been the first step in the biological treatment of cancer, either genetically engineered or naturally occurring. They increase specifically inside cancer cells and destroy them without damaging normal tissues or producing a host immune response against tumour cells or expressing transgenes. One of the most known members of this family is the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a natural oncolytic virus that selectively induces apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in human cancer cells. MethodsThis study performed biochemical and molecular investigations with variable doses of NDV (32, 64, 128 HAU) and liposomal doxorubicin (9 mg/kg) on mouse triple-negative mammary carcinoma cell line 4T1 and BALB/c models tumours for the first time. ResultsReal-time quantitative PCR analysis in NDV-treated animal tumours showed increased expression of P21, P27 and P53 genes and decreased expression of CD34, integrin Alpha 5, VEGF and VEGF-R genes. Additional assessments in treated mouse models also showed that NDV increased ROS production, induced apoptosis, reduced tumour size and significantly improved prognosis, with no adverse effect on normal tissues. ConclusionsThese findings all together might indicate that NDV in combination with chemotherapy drugs could improve prognosis in cancer patients although many more conditions should be considered.

ObjectivesThe aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of alpha Syn seed amplification assays (alpha Syn-SAAs), including RT-QuIC and PMCA, using CSF as source material to differentiate synucleinopathies from controls. MethodsThe electronic MEDLINE database PubMed was searched for relevant articles published until June 30, 2022. Study quality assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 toolbox. A random effects bivariate model was exploited for data synthesis. ResultsOur systematic review identified 27 eligible studies according to the predefined inclusion criteria, of which 22 were included in the final analysis. Overall, 1855 patients with synucleinopathies and 1378 non-synucleinopathies as control subjects were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity to differentiate synucleinopathies from controls with alpha Syn-SAA were 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82-0.93) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92-0.97), respectively. Evaluating the diagnostic performance of RT-QuIC in a subgroup analysis for the detection of patients with multiple system atrophy the pooled sensitivity decreased to 0.30 (95% CI, 0.11-0.59). ConclusionsWhile our study clearly demonstrated a high diagnostic performance of RT-QuIC and PMCA for differentiating synucleinopathies with Lewy bodies from controls, results for the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy were less robust.

In this article, we propose that the national cultural context is a critical moderator and conduct a meta-analysis to examine its influence on diversity training. Our analyses show that the average effect size of diversity training outcomes is significant both inside and outside the U.S. The effect size of specific diversity training design is contingent on such cultural values as power distance, individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance. We conclude our review by providing future directions for cross-cultural research on diversity training.

Optimized chondrocyte expansion and tissue formation could lead to better clinical results of these therapies. In this study, a novel chondrocyte suspension expansion protocol that includes the addition of porcine notochordal cell-derived matrix was used to self-assemble human chondrocytes from osteoarthritic (OA) and nondegenerate (ND) origin into cartilage organoids containing collagen type II and proteoglycans. Proliferation rate and viability were similar for OA and ND chondrocytes and organoids formed had a similar histologic appearance and gene expression profile. Organoids were then encapsulated in viscoelastic alginate hydrogels to form larger tissues. Chondrocytes on the outer bounds of the organoids produced a proteoglycan-rich matrix to bridge the space between organoids. In hydrogels containing ND organoids some collagen type I was observed between the organoids. Surrounding the bulk of organoids in the center of the gels, in both OA and ND gels a continuous tissue containing cells, proteoglycans and collagen type II had been produced. No difference was observed in sulphated glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline content between gels containing organoids from OA or ND origin after 28 days. It was concluded that OA chondrocytes, which can be harvested from leftover surgery tissue, perform similar to ND chondrocytes in terms of human cartilage organoid formation and matrix production in alginate gels. This opens possibilities for their potential to serve as a platform for cartilage regeneration but also as an in vitro model to study pathways, pathology, or drug development.	[Kleuskens, Meike W.

Comorbidity between benzodiazepine use disorder (BUD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD) is common. However, the risk factors are poorly characterized due to the paucity of available BUD screening tools. The present study aimed to rectify this by conducting an observational screening investigation for BUD in patients hospitalized for alcohol detoxification in a specialized unit. During a face-to-face interview, a short BUD screening tool, Echelle Cognitive d'Attachement aux benzodiazepines (ECAB), was administered to record recent patterns of BZD use, thereby allowing categorization of AUD patients as follows: non-BZD users, BZD users without BUD, and BUD (ECAB >= 6). Clinical and sociodemographic risk factors were identified and recorded during clinical assessment and were analyzed using nonparametric bivariate tests and multinomial regression for association with BUD, with p < 0.05 for significance. Of the 150 AUD patients, 23 (15%) had comorbid BUD. Several variables were associated with ECAB score, with their independence being verified using multinomial regression, with lower risk of BUD versus BZD use, when the initial prescriber was an addiction specialist compared with a psychiatrist or a general practitioner [odds ratio (OR) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14-0.75]. A higher risk of BZD use versus no use was evident when comorbid psychiatric disorders were present (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.3-65). Our findings raise clinicians' awareness that in patients hospitalized for alcohol detoxification, BUD is highly prevalent but not specifically related to psychiatric disorders. BUD can be effectively screened by utilization of the ECAB.

Based on a water-soluble double-cavity cyclophane GBox-4(4+), we report a class of host-guest charge transfer (CT) complexes as structurally uniform PTAs for NIR-II photothermal therapy. As a result of its high electron-deficiency, GBox-4(4+) can bind different electron-rich planar guests with a 1 : 2 host/guest stoichiometry to readily tune the CT absorption band that extends to the NIR-II region. When using a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain, the host-guest system realized both good biocompatibility and enhanced photothermal conversion at 1064 nm, and was then exploited as a high-efficiency NIR-II PTA for cancer cell and bacterial ablation. This work broadens the potential applications of host-guest cyclophane systems and provides a new access to bio-friendly NIR-II photoabsorbers with well-defined structures.

The Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, hypoxia, and hypoxia + FA. On day 14 of pregnancy, the intrauterine hypoxia model was created by placing pregnant rats in the hypoxic and low-pressure experimental chamber for 2 hr a day for 3 days. In the hypoxia + FA group, pregnant rats were injected intraperitoneally with 4% FA, once a day for 7 days. The hypoxia group was treated with equal amounts of saline. After delivery, JMJD6 and synaptophysin mRNA and proteins in the hippocampus regions were detected by in situ hybridization and western blotting. The Morris water maze was used to evaluate cognitive function. The neonatal and juvenile rats in the hypoxia group had significantly increased expression of JMJD6 and decreased expression of synaptophysin protein and synaptophysin I mRNA in the hippocampus than those in the control group. Meanwhile, hypoxia also clearly prolonged the escape latency and shortened the stay time in the target quadrant. FA decreased the expression of JMJD6 and increased the expression of synaptophysin and improved cognitive function compared with those in the hypoxia group. FA probably ameliorated the cognitive impairment by regulating JMJD6 and synaptophysin in the hippocampus of neonatal and juvenile rats who had intrauterine hypoxia during pregnancy.

Identifying more promising drug targets for LUAD treatment holds immense clinical significance. Recent studies have revealed that the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) homology motif kinase 1 (UHMK1) is a robust pro-oncogenic factor in many cancers. However, its biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms in LUAD have not been investigated.Methods: The UHMK1 expression in LUAD cells and tissues was evaluated by bioinformatics analysis, immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting (WB), and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. A series of gain-and loss-of-function experiments for UHMK1 were carried out to investigate its biological functions in LUAD in vitro and in vivo. The mechanisms underlying UHMK1's effects in LUAD were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing and WB assays.Results: UHMK1 expression was aberrantly elevated in LUAD tumors and cell lines and positively correlated with tumor size and unfavorable patient prognosis. Function-ally, UHMK1 displayed robust pro-oncogenic capacity in LUAD and mechanistically exerted its biological effects via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.Conclusion: UHMK1 is a potent oncogene in LUAD. Targeting UHMK1 may significantly improve the effect of LUAD treatment via inhibiting multiple biological ways of LUAD progression.

However, the significant mismatch in electronic band structure between the second phases and the matrix often causes a deterioration of carrier mobility. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the electronic band structure of the second phase is adjusted through doping S and Te. It is found that Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 has a highly similar electronic band structure to the Cu2Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu2Se-based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second-phase Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, dislocations, and nanograins are observed in the Cu2Se/5 wt% Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, high figure of merit (zT) values of 2.04 (by Dulong-Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which are about 65% higher than that of Cu2Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p-type Cu2Se with outstanding performance.

In addition, they also have excellent optical properties, biocompatibility, and good application potential in environmental detection and other fields. To realize the special functions of carbon quantum dots, various functionalized composite carbon quantum dots have also been gradually developed. Lignin is a kind of natural polymer material rich in aromatic ring structure, which has abundant pi electrons and a large number of easily functionalized active groups. Therefore, lignin is gradually used as a fluorescent probe material. In this article, sulfadiazine, p-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, ammonium sulfamate as the amination reagents were used to modify lignin, and then citric acid was used as raw material to prepare carbon quantum dots (CQDs), and finally sulfadiazine lignin composite carbon quantum dots (PSA-L-CQDs), sulfamic acid lignin composite carbon quantum dots (BSA-L-CQDs), and sulfamate amine lignin composite carbon quantum dots (ASA-L-CQD) were prepared. Their structure and fluorescence characteristics were analyzed. The selectivity and sensitivity of PSA-L-CQDs to metal ions were tested by fluorescence spectroscopy. The experimental results show that PSA-L-CQDs have good selectivity and high sensitivity to Fe3+. The detection limit of Fe3+ was 29.5634 nmol/L. The composite carbon quantum dots have the advantages of low cost, simple manufacture, high selectivity, and high sensitivity.

Prior to drying at 55, 60, 65, and 70 degrees C in a hot air tray dryer, hot water blanching (H-B), steam blanching (S-B), and microwave blanching (M-B) were employed as pretreatments. Rehydration of dried pretreated sweet corn kernel was performed in boiling water. The pretreatments and drying temperatures were independent factors that affected the dependent factors such as rehydration ratio, total sugar, ascorbic acid, geometric mean diameter, color, sensory evaluation, water absorption, mass, and geometric mean diameter. Peleg, Weibull, and newly proposed models were considered to describe the change in moisture content during rehydration. The proposed model performed better than other models and indicated the rise in equilibrium moisture content of rehydrated sweet corn with an increase in dehydration temperature of sweet corn due to higher R-2 (0.994), and lower chi-square (0.005) and RMSE (0.064). The rehydrated sweet corn obtained from samples processed with microwave blanching and dehydration at 70 degrees C showed higher retention of total sugar, ascorbic acid, geometric mean diameter, and color.

We sought to evaluate the risk of subsequent fractures in subjects with VF identified opportunistically on computed tomography (CT) scans performed as part of routine clinical practice. From the radiology database of Holb ae k Hospital we identified the first CT scan including the thorax and/or abdomen of 2000 consecutive men and women aged 50 years or older, performed from January 1, 2010 onward. The scans were assessed in a blinded approach to identify chest and lumbar VF, and these data linked to national Danish registers. Subjects were excluded if treated with an osteoporosis medication (OM) in the year prior to baseline (date of CT), and the remaining subjects with VF matched on age and sex in 1:2 ratio against subjects with no VF. We found that the risk of major osteoporotic fractures (hip, non-cervical vertebral, humerus, and distal forearm fractures) was higher for subjects with VF than without VF: incidence rates (IRs) were 32.88 and 19.59 fractures per 1000 subject-years, respectively, and the adjusted hazard ratio (HRadj) was 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.86). Subsequent hip fracture IRs were 16.75 and 6.60; HRadj 3.02 (95% CI, 1.39-6.55). There were no significant differences in other fracture outcomes (including a pooled estimate of any subsequent fracture, except face, skull, and fingers: IRs 41.52 and 31.38; HRadj 1.31 [95% CI, 0.85-2.03]). Our findings suggest that subjects undergoing routine CT scans including the chest and/or abdomen are a high risk population in terms of fracture risk. Even within this group, subjects with VF are at higher risk of future major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), in particular hip fracture. Hence, systematic opportunistic screening for VF and subsequent fracture risk management is important to reduce the risk of new fractures.

The knowledge of explicit flow in different networks exhibits the phenomenon of knowledge emergence, but this phenomenon is more obvious in a small-world network. The flow of tacit knowledge in a small-world network has a better effect. In a scale-free network, the quantity and frequency of knowledge flow are significantly higher than those in a small-world network. The reason for this phenomenon is the differences in the response, connection and structure of different networks. The quantity and frequency of the flow of explicit knowledge in the same network are significantly higher than those of tacit knowledge. The reason for this phenomenon is the different types of knowledge flow in different modes, with different levels of flow difficulty and flow sustainability. First, this study visually compares the differences in flow between the two types of knowledge. Second, flow models of the two types of knowledge are constructed, and the flow characteristics of the two types of knowledge in different networks are simulated. Finally, the reasons for the differences in flow between the two types of knowledge are explained by using loosely coupled theory.

Cell population data (CPD) parameters generated by automated hematology analyzers can reflect morphological characteristics of blood cells. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CPD parameters neutrophil (Neu) X, NeuY and NeuZ in assessing neutrophil dysplasia.Methods: 218 MDS patients were divided into two subgroups according to neutrophil morphology. The differences of neutrophil research parameters between the two MDS subgroups and the control group, consisting of 210 healthy individuals, were compared, the correlation among neutrophil research parameters and the relationship between these parameters and cell morphology in MDS patients were analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic analysis were performed.Results: The median values of neutrophil research parameters NeuX and NeuZ in MDS with granulocyte dysplasia group were significantly lower than those in MDS without granulocyte dysplasia group and control group (p < 0.001), and they were positively correlated (r = 0.878, p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of NeuX and NeuZ was 0.720 (95% CI: 0.643-0.796, p < 0.001) and 0.738 (95% CI: 0.665-0.811, p < 0.001), respectively. In addition, with the decrease of NeuX value, neutrophils gradually show decreased nuclear segment and/or cytoplasmic granules.Conclusions: Combining NeuX and NeuZ can predict neutrophil dysplasia features of MDS in peripheral blood, and this can be an easier method to screen for the neutrophil dysplasia cases, as compared with the microscopic examination of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow smears.

J	Vlcek, V				Vlcek, Vaclav			Who cares about the UN General Assembly? National delegations size from 1993 to 2016	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article							UNITED-NATIONS; INTERNATIONAL-ORGANIZATIONS; AID; MULTILATERALISM; DEMOCRACIES; OPERATIONS; PATTERNS; POLITICS	The UN General Assembly is the central forum of world politics. While it formally allows the member states to delegate up to five representatives, the size of the national delegations is generally larger and significantly increases over time. In this paper, I explore the size of the national delegations to the General Assembly from 1993 to 2016. Generally, the major powers (USA, Russia) send the biggest delegations. Surprisingly, China sends significantly smaller delegations than it used to before 2008. Big delegations are also sent by some small (Sweden, Finland, Norway, Switzerland) or developing countries (Nigeria, Bangladesh). My analysis shows that national capacities and issue-specific motivations drive up the delegation size. Although the issue-specific explanations are relatively rare in UN-related research (due to the general-purpose nature of the organisation), I argue that human rights, international security, economic development, and UN governance are the agendas for which states care about the General Assembly.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES			English	Article						adults; cognitive reserve; intellectual disability; intelligence; memory; trajectories; typical development	FLUID INTELLIGENCE; WORKING-MEMORY; COGNITIVE ACTIVITY; SYSTEMS; INDIVIDUALS; ADOLESCENTS; DEMENTIA; PEOPLE; RISK	BackgroundLife expectancy is on rise and the intriguing question is: When does cognitive decline occur among adults with intellectual disability, compared to adults with typical development? This cross-sectional study examined cognitive performance of crystallised/fluid intelligence, working and long-term memory of adults with intellectual disability of etiologies other than Down syndrome (IQ 50-68) and adults with typical development (IQ 85-114) in four age cohorts (30-39; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69). MethodThe WAIS IIIHEB and the Rey-AVLT were administered to both groups. ResultsFour patterns of cognitive performance were found: (a) Vocabulary (crystallised intelligence), Spatial Span Forward and Retention yielded similar scores across all four age cohorts in participants with typical development and with intellectual disability. (b) Similarities, Raven and Digit Span Backward exhibit lower scores only in 50-59 or 60-69 compared to the 30-39 age cohort in both groups, (c) Digit Span Forward, Spatial Span Backward and Total Leaning (LTM) yielded lower scores in the 50-59 or 60-69 age cohorts in the typical group, but similar scores in participants with intellectual disability along the age cohorts, (d) Block Design (fluid intelligence) yielded a lower score in the 50-59 cohort versus lower scores only at ages 60-69 in participants with typical development. ConclusionsOur findings suggest a possible parallel trajectory in age-related cognitive performance for individuals with and without intellectual disability in six measures, and a possible more preserved trajectory in fluid intelligence and some memory measures in adults with intellectual disability compared to their peers. Caution should be exercised regarding Digit and Spatial Span Backwards, which yielded a floor effect in participants with intellectual disability. The Cognitive Reserve Theory, the Safeguard Hypothesis and late maturation might serve as explanations for these findings.

Herein, drug-loaded hollow mesoporous ferrite nanoparticles coated by gelatin (GM/HMFNs) with pomegranate structure are prepared and compounded into calcium magnesium phosphate cement (MCPC) as a Trap-Capture-Kill system to kill bacteria and inhibit biofilm formation efficiently. Under the action of alternating magnetic field (AMF), MCPC/GM/HMFNs/Drug composites exhibit acute magnetic hyperthermal capacity and recruit the free bacteria. Then, the permeability of bacterial cell membrane is increased via reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage of nano-MgO and HMFNs, providing channels through which vancomycin (Van) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) encapsulated in GM/HMFNs can penetrate. Subsequently, the bacteria are efficiently killed under the synergetic cooperation of magnetothermal effect, ROS damage, and adsorption damage of nano-MgO, and the bioactive ions and drugs. The antibacterial system also presents outstanding pro-osteogenesis and pro-angiogenic capacity in vitro. And it promotes the vascularized bone regeneration of infective femoral defect in SD rats in vivo, providing promising potential for the treatment of infected bone defects through magnetothermal therapy.

In addition, it is thought that sports activities performed during the developmental period are effective in improving handgrip strength, but it is unknown what types of sports are more effective. As a first step, we conducted a cross-sectional study to compare handgrip strength across different sports (upper-body gripping sports vs. lower body) in early adulthood. MethodsWe used the Juntendo Fitness Plus Study data from 1973 to 2018 and selected two types of sporting events with matching physiques (soccer, baseball, and kendo) but different degrees of gripping. Data on 7344 male first-year sports university students included 1127 soccer, 297 Kendo, and 698 baseball players. ResultsThose in the lower body-only (soccer) sports had -3.78 (95% CI: -4.27, -3.29) kg lower handgrip strength than those in the lower + upper (kendo and baseball). Comparing each individual sport found that each sport was different from each other with Kendo > Baseball > Soccer (between each sport, p < .001). In addition, the difference between sports has become greater across time. ConclusionsIn early adulthood, handgrip strength is greatest in those participating in sports with upper-body movements compared to those participating in sports that mainly involved lower-body movements. The three sports we selected are natural activities that do not directly train handgrip strength. Therefore, sport may be one potential method to improve low handgrip strength in children/adolescents during the developmental period.

Interlayer transition has a significant effect on the optoelectronic performance of vdWs heterostructure devices, and strong interlayer transition in 2D vdWs heterojunction is always demandable for sufficient charge transfer and rapid speed response. Herein, a state-of-the-art review is presented on recent progress on interlayer transition in vdWs heterostructures for near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors. First, the general synthesis techniques for vdWs heterostructures, band alignments in the vdWs heterostructures are provided. Then, the mechanism of interlayer transition in vdWs heterostructure and recent progress on interlayer transition in vdWs heterostructures for NIR photodetectors are summarized. Afterward, some worthy applications of NIR photodetectors are reviewed in related areas of this topic. At the last, an outlook, challenges, and future research directions of vdWs heterostructures for photodetectors at broaden response spectrum are presented.

J	Ebert, N				Ebert, Norbert			From Keynes' Possibilities to Contemporary Precarities: Reflections on the Origins of Our Economically and Politically Precarious Times	SOCIOLOGY LENS			English	Article								In his essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren John Maynard Keynes delineates an economic utopia where most work is done with the aid of technology. In contrast to pessimistic views associated with the term 'technological unemployment' today, Keynes offers an optimistic vision for work societies where technology facilitates more freedom from paid work. Keynes also envisaged a softening of the capitalist work ethic and achievement principle. Today, however, technologically inflicted unemployment is perceived as a threat where gainful employment as a cost and meaningful activity is reduced while profits are maximized. Simultaneously, moral pressures to be employed, self-sufficient and to contribute to society have solidified. Inspired by Keynes' vision, it is argued that the origins of our economically and politically precarious times lie in a 'de-politicization of work'. What Keynes perceives as economic possibilities needs to be complemented with political possibilities which otherwise turn into economic and political precarities.

In this work, we consider group based resource allocation for industrial IoT networks where cellular-IoT (C-IoT) devices support uplink transmission for multiple IoT groups/clusters. The joint group and subcarrier optimization problem is formulated for maximizing the cell/group throughput under the optimal group member selection, subcarrier and minimum data rate constraints. Depending on the interference information, the interference aware group allocation (IA-GA) is proposed to find the cellular user and cellular-IoT device grouping for each subcarrier. However, to achieve the maximizing the cell/group throughput, another iterative algorithm, namely genetic algorithm based group allocation (GA-GA) method is proposed, which provides an optimal solution for the user grouping in the most of the cases where an iterative technique is used for the sub-carrier allocation. Simulations results show that the proposed IA-GA and GA-GA methods provide enhanced cell throughput gain and accessibility of the C-IoTs.

In an earlier study, we applied multiregional whole exome sequencing on multiple primary tumor samples and found alterations of the SWI/SNF complex in 78% of the cases. ERBB2, which encodes for Her2/neu, is a well-known predictive biomarker used to guide the treatment of GC in the palliative setting. SMARCE1, which encodes for a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, is localized in close genetic proximity to ERBB2.Aim As little is known about the significance of the SWI/SNF complex in GC biology and the potential relationship between ERBB2 and SMARCE1 upregulation, we examined the expression patterns of SMARCA4 and SMARCE1, two mutually exclusive catalytic ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, in a well characterized GC cohort.Materials and Methods The expression of SMARCA4 and SMARCE1 was studied by immunohistochemistry in connection with clinicopathological patient characteristics in a cohort of 468 GCs. Digital droplet polymerase chain reaction was performed for amplification analysis on ERBB2 and SMARCE1.Results Immunohistochemical staining of whole-mount tissue sections found a diffusely "gray scale " expression of SMARCA4 in 446 (95.2%) GCs and of SMARCE1 in 463 (98.8%) GCs. The expression of SMARCA4 and SMARCE1 correlated significantly with ARID1A, p53, and microsatellite status. No correlation was found with the patient prognosis. The amplification analysis of SMARCE1 showed amplification in 4 of 34 cases. In 3 of 34 cases, SMARCE1 was co-amplified with ERBB2. We also found a co-expression of SMARCE1 and Her2/neu in a subset of patients.Conclusion While the effect of a co-amplification is currently unknown, synergistic effects of SMARCE1 and Her2/neu overexpression should be explored in future studies, holding potential for an improved treatment of GC.

Patterns and predictors of ungulate space use across an isolated Miombo woodland reserve	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						black rhinoceros; camera trapping; fire frequency; habitat fragmentation; habitat use; Malawi; occupancy modelling; water dependence; large herbivores	AFRICAN SAVANNA; HABITAT SELECTION; LARGE PREDATORS; PROTECTED AREA; NATIONAL-PARK; LARGE-MAMMALS; TRADE-OFFS; LANDSCAPE; PREY; OCCUPANCY	Understanding ecological- and management-related predictors of mammal space use within protected areas is critical for management planning. This is particularly true in small, fenced and isolated reserves where we hypothesised that management-related activities will influence large herbivore space use more than ecological characteristics. We used camera trap data to assess the space use patterns for 18 ungulate species in the small and isolated Majete Wildlife Reserve (Majete) in the understudied Miombo woodland ecoregion of southern Malawi. In the 2018 dry season, the 691 km(2) reserve was systematically surveyed for ungulate presence at 140 camera trap locations. Over a period of 5456 camera days, the survey yielded 11 078 independent detections of 18 ungulate species and three predators. Using a single-species occupancy modelling framework, the probability of space use of ungulates was assessed in relation to five management (fire exposure, fire frequency, water availability, distance from fence and road) and five ecological (visibility, grass biomass, vegetation type, terrain ruggedness and predator abundance) space use covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Top-ranked models contained multiple covariates for 15 of the 16 species modelled, with only nyala's (Tragelaphus angasii) space use best predicted by vegetation type only. Distance to water, vegetation type, visibility and fire frequency were predictors having strong influences on six or more species each. More management-related covariates reflected in top models, but ecological covariates had more meaningful effect sizes making us reject the hypothesis. Importantly though, distance from the roads and fence were also identified as prominent predictors. Notably, black rhinoceros' (Diceros bicornis) probability of space use increased with distance from the reserve boundary. Beyond informing habitat management for ungulates in Majete, these results can form the basis for understanding species-specific space use patterns in other small reserves with similar characteristics and threats.

Situational awareness in a creeping crisis: How the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic were handled from a crisis management perspective in the Nursing Home Agency in Oslo	JOURNAL OF CONTINGENCIES AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						COVID-19; creeping crisis; decision making; management; pandemic; situation awareness; uncertainty	PERFORMANCE	In March 2020, the municipality of Oslo's Nursing Home Agency was hit by Norway's first COVID-19 outbreak. Being responsible for a very vulnerable group, they had to deal with a situation never before encountered and of which they had very limited knowledge. In this study, we explored how situational awareness (SA) changed from a creeping to an urgent crisis. We undertook a case study of the Nursing Home Agency's top management during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019 through late March 2020). We conducted individual interviews with the management in charge of decisions. Thematic analysis yielded four main categories affecting SA: perception of event development, perception of available time, information, and cooperation and trust. We found that subjective experience of the geographical proximity of the crisis and subjective experience of time were essential in shaping SA. Perception of time was essential to the understanding of urgency, which was an important factor in reacting properly. Further, the perception of space was necessary for the crisis to be interpreted as critical. Time and space are objective factors but are perceived subjectively. Our model showed that the crisis must be perceived as urgent for proper actions to be decided upon.	[Saetren, Gunhild. B. B.] Nord Univ, Business Sch, Bodo, Norway; [Saetren, Gunhild. B.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanism of this pest. In this study, we found that a salivary secretory protein, Rp614, induced cell death in nonhost Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. NbSGT1 and NbNDR1 are involved in Rp614-induced cell death. Tissue specificity analysis showed that Rp614 is mainly present in salivary glands and is highly induced during pest feeding. RNA interference experiments showed that staygreen syndrome caused by R. pedestris was significantly attenuated when Rp614 was silenced. Together, our results indicate that Rp614 plays an essential role in R. pedestris infestation and provide a promising RNA interference target for pest control.

Age- and calendar year-corrected standardized prostate cancer incidence (SIR) and prostate cancer-specific mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and heterogeneity among age groups was assessed with the Cochran's Q test.Results The median time to censoring was 11 years, and 4434 men were followed for more than 15 years. The corrected SIR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-5.4) and the corrected SMR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.81). Estimates differed among age groups (P < 0.001 for both), with a higher SIR and SMR among younger men.Conclusion Men with non-malignant TRUS biopsy have a much higher incidence of prostate cancer but a risk of prostate cancer death below the population average. This underlines that the oncological risk of cancers missed in the initial TRUS biopsy is low. Accordingly, attempts to increase the sensitivity of initial biopsy are unjustified. Moreover, current follow-up after non-malignant biopsy is likely to be overaggressive, particularly in men over the age of 60 years.	[Stroomberg, Hein V.; Andersen, Marc C.

Factors related to parenting styles of Chinese mothers of children with and without intellectual disability	JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY RESEARCH			English	Article						China; Family support; Intellectual disability; Parenting sense of competence; Parenting stress; Parenting style	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; YOUNG-CHILDREN; DEVELOPMENTAL-DISABILITIES; INDONESIAN PARENTS; AFFILIATE STIGMA; SOCIAL SUPPORT; SELF-EFFICACY; FAMILIES; STRESS; BEHAVIOR	BackgroundParenting styles play a crucial role in children's development. However, approaches to parenting children with intellectual disability (ID) beyond Western cultures have been underexamined. This study compared the self-reported parenting styles of Chinese mothers of children with and without ID and examined some factors that might be related. MethodsChinese mothers of children with ID (n = 173) and mothers of typically developing children (n = 119) completed measures of their parenting style, parenting stress, parenting sense of competence and family support. ResultsBoth groups endorsed similar levels of authoritative parenting, but mothers of children with ID were more likely to report adopting strategies aligned with authoritarian parenting. For mothers in the ID group, family support moderated the effects of parenting stress and parenting sense of competence on authoritative parenting. Parenting stress and parenting sense of competence, respectively, predicted authoritarian parenting for mothers of children with and without ID. ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of reducing parenting stress, strengthening parenting sense of competence and providing family support in order to promote optimal parenting styles for Chinese mothers of children with ID.

Building on a sample of 14,185 firm-year observations from 43 countries during 2010-2019, this study shows that while board gender diversity and CSR disclosure are positively associated, countries' secrecy levels negatively affect CSR disclosure. However, we provide evidence that the higher female representation on the board of directors significantly attenuates the restrictive role of secrecy culture on the CSR disclosure level. In other words, the suppressive effect of national secrecy on CSR disclosure weakens firms with higher gender diversity on the board of directors. Our results are robust to several sensitivity checks and endogeneity problems. This study suggests that the reducing effects of national secrecy culture on firms' CSR disclosure level can be attenuated by utilizing internal governance mechanisms such as board gender diversity.

Although septin group members are viewed to function as hetero-oligomeric complexes, the role of individual septins within these complexes or in isolation is poorly understood. Decades of work using mouse models has shown that some septins (including SEPT7) are essential for animal development, while others (including SEPT6) are dispensable, suggesting that some septins may compensate for the absence of others. The zebrafish genome encodes 19 septin genes, representing the full complement of septin groups described in mice and humans. In this report, we characterise null mutants for zebrafish Sept6 (a member of the SEPT6 group) and Sept15 (a member of the SEPT7 group) and test their role in zebrafish development and host defence against Shigella infection. We show that null mutants for Sept6 and Sept15 are both viable, and that expression of other zebrafish septins are not significantly affected by their mutation. Consistent with previous reports using knockdown of Sept2, Sept7b, and Sept15, we show that Sept6 and Sept15 are required for host defence against Shigella infection. These results highlight Shigella infection of zebrafish as a powerful system to study the role of individual septins in vivo.

Herein, we designed a fusion protein with a cetuximab-derived single-chain variable fragment targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR scFv) and the anticancer lytic peptide (ACLP) ZXR2, connected by a linker (G(4)S)(3) and MMP2 cleavage site. The anti-EGFR scFv-ZXR2 recombinant protein showed specific anticancer activity on EGFR-overexpressed cancer cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as it can bind to EGFR on cancer cell surfaces. This fusion protein caused cell membrane lysis as ZXR2, and showed improved stability in serum compared with ZXR2. These results suggest that scFv-ACLP fusion proteins may be potential anticancer drug candidates for targeted cancer treatment, which also provide a feasible idea for targeted drug design.

Thirty to forty-seven percent of patients treated with exclusive radiotherapy for prostate cancer will experience intraprostate recurrence. The use of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions allows millimetric accuracy in irradiation to the target zone that minimizes the dose to organs at risk. In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcome of prostatic reirradiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated by radiotherapy. MethodThis single-center retrospective study included 41 patients diagnosed with exclusive local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiotherapy and treatedby stereotactic Cyberknife irradiation. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and the safety of stereotactic reirradiation for patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated with radiotherapy. ResultsMedian follow-up was 35 months. The 2-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 72.89%, the 2-year local recurrence free survival was 93.59%, the 2-year local regional recurrence-free survival was 85.24%, and the 2-year metastasis-free survival was to 91.49%. The analysis of toxicities showed a good tolerance of stereotactic irradiation. Urinary and gastro-intestinal adverse events was mostly of grades 1-2 (CTCAEv4). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in one to two patients. ConclusionStereotactic reirradiation appears effective and well-tolerated for local recurrence of prostate cancer and might allow to delay the introduction of hormonal therapy and its side effects.

J	Askarzadeh, A; Yung, K; Najand, M				Askarzadeh, Alireza; Yung, Kenneth; Najand, Mohammad			Managerial sentiment and predicted and opportunistic special items	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article						managerial sentiment; opportunistic special items; predicted special items; unjustified beliefs	INVESTOR SENTIMENT; EARNINGS; CLASSIFICATION; PERSISTENCE; CONSTRAINTS; GAAP	Prior studies suggest that firm managers misclassify core expenses as special items to influence investors' perception of firm performance. In this investigation, we find that managerial decisions regarding misclassification of expenses are affected by managerial sentiment. Managerial sentiment has a negative relation with special-item reporting because optimistic (pessimistic) managers pursue a misclassification that is lower (higher) than what is justified by the information available to the manager. By decomposing special items into predicted (PREDSI) and opportunistic (OPSI) components, we find that the effect of managerial sentiment is pronounced among opportunistic special items. Our results show that PREDSI (OPSI) has a non-negative (negative) relation with future firm performance, and special items associated with managerial sentiment adversely affect future firm performance. We also find results that suggest that financial constraints serve as a channel that reinforces the negative association between managerial sentiment and special items. Specifically, financial constraints impose a limit on how frequently sentiment-driven managers can misclassify core expenses because misclassifications obscure firm transparency and harm the credit supply. Our results remain consistent after a battery of robustness tests.

Tripeptide gut hormone infusion does not alter food preferences or sweet taste function in volunteers with obesity and prediabetes/diabetes but promotes restraint eating: A secondary analysis of a randomized single-blind placebo-controlled study	DIABETES OBESITY & METABOLISM			English	Article						antiobesity drug; bariatric surgery; GLP-1; obesity therapy; randomized trial; weight control	GASTRIC BYPASS-SURGERY; VERTICAL BANDED GASTROPLASTY; GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1; WEIGHT-LOSS; BARIATRIC SURGERY; MORBIDLY OBESE; HEDONIC HUNGER; GLP-1 RESPONSE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DIETARY-INTAKE	Aims: To investigate whether the elevation in postprandial concentrations of the gut hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), oxyntomodulin (OXM) and peptide YY (PYY) accounts for the beneficial changes in food preferences, sweet taste function and eating behaviour after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).Materials and methods: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized single-blind study in which we infused GLP-1, OXM, PYY (GOP) or 0.9% saline subcutaneously for 4 weeks in 24 subjects with obesity and prediabetes/diabetes, to replicate their peak postprandial concentrations, as measured at 1 month in a matched RYGB cohort ( NCT01945840). A 4-day food diary and validated eating behaviour questionnaires were completed. Sweet taste detection was measured using the method of constant stimuli. Correct sucrose identification (corrected hit rates) was recorded, and sweet taste detection thresholds (EC50s: half maximum effective concencration values) were derived from concentration curves. The intensity and consummatory reward value of sweet taste were assessed using the generalized Labelled Magnitude Scale.Results: Mean daily energy intake was reduced by 27% with GOP but no significant changes in food preferences were observed, whereas a reduction in fat and increase in protein intake were seen post-RYGB. There was no change in corrected hit rates or detection thresholds for sucrose detection following GOP infusion. Additionally, GOP did not alter the intensity or consummatory reward value of sweet taste. A significant reduction in restraint eating, comparable to the RYGB group was observed with GOP.Conclusion: The elevation in plasma GOP concentrations after RYGB is unlikely to mediate changes in food preferences and sweet taste function after surgery but may promote restraint eating.

In contrast, other deviations imply sensitivity to irrelevant evidence and suggest the use of overly complex rules. The current analysis takes two steps toward identifying the conditions that trigger these contradictory deviations from efficient reasoning. The first step involves a theoretical analysis. It shows that the contradictory deviations can be captured without assuming the use of rules of different complexity in different settings. Both deviations can be the product of a reliance on small samples of similar past experiences. This reliance on small samples triggers apparent overcomplexity when the optimal rule is simple, but more complex rules yield better outcomes in most cases; the opposite tendency, oversimplification, emerges when the optimal rule is complex, and simple rules yield better outcomes in most cases. The second step involves a preregistered experiment with 325 participants (Mechanical Turk workers). The experiment shows that human decision makers exhibit the pattern predicted by the reliance-on-small-samples assumption. In the experiment, participants chose between the status quo and a risky alternative in a multi-attribute decision with three binary cues. They used uninformative cues when this strategy was best in most cases yet ignored two informative cues when this strategy was best in most cases. In addition, describing the cues as recommendations given by three experts increased the tendency to follow the modal recommendation (even when reliance on only one of the experts was optimal), but people still behaved as though they relied on a small sample of past experiences.

A survey of South Carolina pharmacists' readiness to prescribe human immunodeficiency virus pre-exposure prophylaxis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CLINICAL PHARMACY			English	Article						HIV prevention; pharmacists; PrEP; South Carolina; Southern United States	HEALTH-CARE COSTS; HIGH-RISK; HIV; KNOWLEDGE; THERAPY; PROGRAM; TIME	IntroductionHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is largely underutilized in the Southern United States. Given their community presence, pharmacists are well positioned to provide PrEP within rural, Southern regions. However, pharmacists' readiness to prescribe PrEP in these communities remains unknown. ObjectiveTo determine the perceived feasibility and acceptability of prescribing PrEP by pharmacists in South Carolina (SC). MethodsWe distributed a 43-question online descriptive survey through the University of South Carolina Kennedy Pharmacy Innovation Center's listserv of licensed SC pharmacists. We assessed pharmacists' comfort, knowledge, and readiness to provide PrEP. ResultsA total of 150 pharmacists responded to the survey. The majority were White (73%, n = 110), female (62%, n = 93), and non-Hispanic (83%, n = 125). Pharmacists practiced in retail (25%, n = 37), hospital (22%, n = 33), independent (17%, n = 25), community (13%, n = 19), specialty (6%, n = 9), and academic settings (3%, n = 4); 11% (n = 17) practiced in rural locales. Pharmacists viewed PrEP as both effective (97%, n = 122/125) and beneficial (74% n = 97/131) for their clients. Many pharmacists reported being ready (60% n = 79/130) and willing (86% n = 111/129) to prescribe PrEP, although over half (62% n = 73/118) cited lack of PrEP knowledge as a barrier. Pharmacists described pharmacies as an appropriate location to prescribe PrEP (72% n = 97/134). ConclusionsMost SC pharmacists surveyed considered PrEP to be effective and beneficial for individuals who frequent their pharmacy and are willing to prescribe this therapy if statewide statutes allow. Many felt that pharmacies are an appropriate location to prescribe PrEP but lack a complete understanding of required protocols to manage these patients. Further investigation into facilitators and barriers of pharmacy-driven PrEP is needed to enhance utilization within communities.

Impact of Canada's cannabis legalisation on youth emergency department visits for cannabis-related disorders and poisoning in Ontario and Alberta, 2015-2019	DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW			English	Article						cannabis legalisation; cannabis-related disorders; emergency department; ICD-10; morbidity	DRINKING-AGE LAWS; RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA; LEGALIZATION; ALCOHOL	Introduction: Although there is momentum towards legalising adult recreational cannabis use worldwide, the extent of youth cannabis-related harm associated with legalisation is still uncertain. The current study aimed to assess whether the initial implementation of Canada's cannabis legalisation (via the Cannabis Act) on 17 October 2018 might be associated with youth harm, as assessed by emergency department visits for cannabis-related disorders/poisoning.Methods: We used Ontario and Alberta, Canada emergency department data from 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2019. We identified all cannabis-related disorders/poisoning (ICD-10 CA: F12.X, T40.7) emergency department visits of youth (n = 13,615), defined as patients younger than the minimum legal cannabis sales age (18 years, Alberta; 19 years, Ontario). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models were employed to assess the impact of legalisation on weekly counts of cannabis-related harms.Results: The final SARIMA intervention (step) parameter indicated a post-legalisation increase of 14.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0; 24.3, p < 0.01) weekly youth cannabis-related disorder/poisoning presentations to Ontario/Alberta emergency department settings, equivalent to an increase of 20.0% (95% CI 6.2%; 33.9%). There was no evidence of associations between cannabis legalisation and comparison series of youth alcohol, opioid or appendicitis emergency department episodes.Discussion/Conclusion: Our findings require replication and extension but are consistent with the possibility that the implementation of the Cannabis Act was associated with an increase in youth cannabis-related presentations to Ontario/Alberta emergency departments.

JOURNAL OF ORAL PATHOLOGY & MEDICINE			English	Review						carcinoma; HNSCC; HPV; radiomics; squamous	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; UNITED-STATES; HEAD; HPV; CANCER; IMAGES	BackgroundThe increase of the incidence of human papillomavirus dependent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is alarming, although we have greatly progressed in the classification and staging of this disease. We now know that human papillomavirus related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a sub-type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with favourable prognosis and good response to therapy that needs a proper system of classification and staging. Thus, in routine practice it is essential to test patients for the presence of human papillomavirus. The most popular technique to assess human papillomavirus status is immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples with p16, which is an excellent surrogate for high-risk human papillomavirus infection. Another highly sensitive and specific tissue-based technique for the detection of human papillomavirus is RNAscope In situ hybridization that has a prohibitive cost, limiting its use in routine practice. Radiomics is an artificial intelligence based non-invasive method of computational analysis of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and ultrasound images. MethodsIn this review, we summarise the last findings of radiomics applied to human papillomavirus associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. ResultsA growing body of evidence suggest that radiomics is able to characterise and detect early relapse after treatment, and enable development of tailored therapy of human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para-(NC)(2)C6H4 in a one-pot reaction between [Cp(R)Fe(eta(5)-P-5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three-component self-assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)(2)C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

J	Kadfak, A; Wilhelm, M; Oskarsson, P				Kadfak, Alin; Wilhelm, Miriam; Oskarsson, Patrik			Thai Labour NGOs during the 'Modern Slavery' Reforms: NGO Transitions in a Post-aid World	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article							NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS; BUSINESS; TRAFFICKING; POLITICS; GOVERNMENTALITY; PERSPECTIVES; COOPERATION; ALLIANCES; ACTORS; RIGHTS	This article explores how domestic NGOs responded to new opportunities that emerged during the 2015-2020 'modern slavery' labour reforms in Thailand's seafood sector. The analysis takes place against the background of civil society transitions in a 'post-aid' setting. Like NGOs in other middle-income countries, the Thai NGO sector has struggled to remain relevant and financially viable in recent decades, as international donors have withdrawn from countries with steadily declining poverty rates. As a result of the 'developmental successes' of Thailand, the NGO sector needed to rethink its strategies. Examining the modern slavery labour reform process provides an opportunity to understand the strategic choices available to NGOs in the face of several important phenomena: the emergence of new actors such as international philanthropic donors; the growing influence of the private sector in governance matters; and the need for NGOs to balance multiple strategic alliances. The article draws on in-depth interviews to explore narratives of Thai labour NGO adjustments during the period of the modern slavery reform. The study contributes to a better understanding of how NGOs in post-aid countries transition and adapt to changing circumstances by embracing new roles as 'sub-contractors' for emerging global philanthropic donors and as 'partners' of private corporations.

It was found that upon irradiation of the initial tricarbonyl complex, one CO ligand is released to form a colored dicarbonyl chelate, which in the presence of CO enters the reverse thermal reaction to give the initial tricarbonyl complex. In the presence of some other external ligands, the chelate cycle is disclosed and dicarbonyl complex with external ligand is formed demonstrating hemilabile properties of the chelate studied. It was found that the introduction of a cymantrenyl group in a phthalimide molecule, which usually exhibits electron acceptor properties, has a significant effect on the characteristics of the absorption and emission spectra, electrochemical properties.

Blending biochars with organic or inorganic nutrients could slow down nutrient release, which can enhance fertilizer-use efficiency. This study investigates whether charging biochar with nutrients and Acacia gum (Acacia senegal L.) coating can improve nutrient-use efficiency in a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation system using low application rates (<5 t ha(-1)). The experiment was conducted in western Burkina Faso during three cropping seasons (2018-2020) with five treatments: T0, control; T1, conventional practice with compost and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) application; T2, microdose (planting hole application) of NPK; T3. nutrient-charged biochar activated with dissolved NPK; T4, nutrient-charged biochar activated with dissolved NPK and coated with Acacia gum. Biochar-based fertilizers significantly increased soil organic C content, as well as bioavailable P and calcium (Ca), without significantly improving crop yields, compared to conventional practice and microdose of NPK. When nutrient-charged biochar was coated with Acacia gum, N-use efficiency (NUE; N recovered in grain/N fertilized) was improved compared to uncoated nutrient-charged biochar, although the difference was not significant. Despite no significant effects on crop yields during three cropping seasons, the use of coated biochar-based fertilizer may be a technically effective solution to improve NUE in the long term in agroecosystems characterized by nutrient-impoverished soils under a constraining South-Sudanese climate.

IWB is defined as the internalization of negative attitudes and beliefs about people due to their weight. Although IWB has been linked with weight change and depression in other samples, it has never been investigated in the postpartum period. MethodsWe used a cross-sectional survey design. Participants were 251 women recruited via social media who were living in the United States and 6 to 12 months postpartum. We calculated percentage of body weight gained during pregnancy and percentage of that weight that was retained postpartum from self-reported weights. Participants completed self-report measures of IWB (modified version of the Weight Bias Internalization Scale) and postpartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale). ResultsGestational weight gain was not significantly associated with IWB or depression. Postpartum retention of gestational weight was significantly positively associated with both IWB and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, IWB mediated the relationship between postpartum weight retention and depressive symptoms. DiscussionPostpartum retention of weight gained during pregnancy, but not weight gain itself, was related to both IWB and depressive symptoms. The relationship between pregnancy-related weight changes and psychological distress is complex. Sociocultural pressures to return to a prepregnancy physical state swiftly after giving birth may increase risk for IWB during a time in life when stress is already likely to be high, posing additional psychological risk. IWB existing prepregnancy may also worsen postpartum self-concept, contributing to depression. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to directly assess associations among gestational weight change, IWB, and postpartum depression. In addition to discussing weight in pregnancy, perinatal care providers could improve postpartum health by helping women set realistic, body-positive goals postpartum.	[Sharp, Meghan; Ward, L.

AimThis study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a human-derived B-domain-deleted recombinant factor VIII (TQG202) in the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in moderate/severe haemophilia A patients. MethodsThis multicentre, single-arm clinical trial enrolled moderate/severe haemophilia patients previously treated with FVIII concentrates for >= 50 exposure days (EDs) from May 2017 to October 2019. TQG202 was injected intravenously on-demand for bleeding episode management. The primary endpoints were the infusion efficiency at 15 and 60 min after the first administration and haemostatic efficacy of the first bleeding episode. Safety was also monitored. ResultsFifty-six participants were enrolled with a median age of 24.5 (range: 12-64) years old. The median total dose of TQG202 was 29,250 IU per participant (range: 1750-2,02,500), and the median number of administrations was 24.5 (2-116). The median infusion efficiency at 15 and 60 min after the first administration was 155.4% and 145.2%, respectively. Among the 48 first bleeding episodes evaluated, 47 (83.9%, 95% CI: 71.7%-92.4%) had a haemostatic efficacy rating of excellent or good. Eleven (19.6%) participants had treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), but no >= grade 3 TRAE was observed.

J	Tenso, K; Pizer, S; Palani, S				Tenso, Kertu; Pizer, Steven; Palani, Sivagaminathan			Delivery system emergency department capacity and its effect on nonsystem service utilization	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							VETERANS; HEALTH; CARE; HOMELESS; VISITS	Background: Emergency department (ED) use is often seen as a source of excess health care spending, prompting managers to limit ED capacity in their health systems. However, if limited ED capacity in a delivery system leads patients to seek emergency care elsewhere, then health care quality and efficient management may be compromised within the system.Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the effect of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in-house ED clinician capacity on VHA community care (CC) ED claims.Methods: We used administrative data from the VHA to identify CC ED claims and Department of Veterans Affairs emergency physician (EP) capacity for 2014-2019. We used quasi-experimental instrumental variables approach with two different instruments: percent weekday federal holidays and VHA EP full-time equivalents (FTEs). We controlled for VHA ED variables such as ED wait times (door to triage, door to doctor, and door to admission) and demand variables such as alternative insurance coverage, driving time to VHA care, and demographic variables (employment, age, household income, race, gender, and VHA priority status).Results: After instrumenting for capacity with percent weekday federal holidays, we found that one clinic-day capacity (one 8-h ED shift) per 10,000 enrollees increase at the VHA ED will result in a reduction of 61 CC ED claims per 10,000 enrollees. After instrumenting for capacity with EP FTE, we found that one clinic-day capacity (one 8-h ED shift) per 10,000 enrollees increase at the VHA ED will result in a reduction of 48 CC ED claims per 10,000 enrollees. Both of these results are statistically significant at p < 0.001.Conclusions: Our findings imply that offering more in-house ED care, in the form of clinician capacity, can substantially reduce out-of-system ED use. The results may be of interest to integrated health care system managers who prefer their patients to stay within network.

Drawing upon the engagement of diverse and community economies studies with assemblage thinking, this article utilizes assemblage thinking to expand our understanding of power dynamics in community economies, and to reveal the power-led processes involved in building and maintaining community economies. The article focuses on the case of a women's cooperative spearheaded by the Kurdish Movement, which managed to circumvent state oppression and stay in business, despite the turmoil that erupted in Northern Kurdistan after the collapse of peace negotiations between the Turkish state and the Kurdish Movement in 2015.

Small tradeoffs between social equity and conservation outcomes in a freshwater payment for ecosystem services scheme	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						conservation; environmental flows; equity; freshwater ecosystems; payment for ecosystem services	ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EFFICIENCY; MANAGEMENT; ALLOCATION; SCARCITY; CURVE; OFFS	Conservation programs around the world aim to balance social equity, economic efficiency, and conservation outcomes. Tradeoffs among these three objectives necessarily exist but have been quantified in only a handful of systems. Here, we use a multi-objective mathematical optimization model in a large, water-limited river basin to quantify these tradeoffs in a freshwater payment for ecosystem services (PES) program aimed at establishing environmental flows (e-flows). Across a range of budgetary and future climate scenarios, we find that tradeoffs between social equity and conservation outcomes are small. We also show that payment schemes in which incentives are allocated to a single water use sector are much less cost-effective than schemes in which incentives are allocated among multiple sectors. Thus, allocating payments equally among agricultural, municipal, and industrial sectors can be both more equitable and more cost-effective. Overall, our results illustrate how some carefully designed conservation programs may be able to achieve a triple bottom line of social equity, economic efficiency, and conservation effectiveness.

Assessing the contributions of modifiable risk factors to serious falls and fragility fractures among older persons living with HIV	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article						falls; fragility fractures; HIV; LE-AAF	VETERANS AGING COHORT; OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURE; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; UNINFECTED WOMEN; UNITED-STATES; INJURIES; ADULTS; MORTALITY; HEALTH; MEN	Background: Although 50 years represents middle age among uninfected individuals, studies have shown that persons living with HIV (PWH) begin to demonstrate elevated risk for serious falls and fragility fractures in the sixth decade; the proportions of these outcomes attributable to modifiable factors are unknown.Methods: We analyzed 21,041 older PWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART) from the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from 01/01/2010 through 09/30/2015. Serious falls were identified by Ecodes and a machine-learning algorithm applied to radiology reports. Fragility fractures (hip, vertebral, and upper arm) were identified using ICD9 codes. Predictors for both models included a serious fall within the past 12 months, body mass index, physiologic frailty (VACS Index 2.0), illicit substance and alcohol use disorders, and measures of multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We separately fit multivariable logistic models to each outcome using generalized estimating equations. From these models, the longitudinal extensions of average attributable fraction (LE-AAF) for modifiable risk factors were estimated.Results: Key risk factors for both outcomes included physiologic frailty (VACS Index 2.0) (serious falls [15%; 95% CI 14%-15%]; fractures [13%; 95% CI 12%-14%]), a serious fall in the past year (serious falls [7%; 95% CI 7%-7%]; fractures [5%; 95% CI 4%-5%]), polypharmacy (serious falls [5%; 95% CI 4%-5%]; fractures [5%; 95% CI 4%-5%]), an opioid prescription in the past month (serious falls [7%; 95% CI 6%-7%]; fractures [9%; 95% CI 8%-9%]), and diagnosis of alcohol use disorder (serious falls [4%; 95% CI 4%-5%]; fractures [8%; 95% CI 7%-8%]).Conclusions: This study confirms the contributions of risk factors important in the general population to both serious falls and fragility fractures among older PWH. Successful prevention programs for these outcomes should build on existing prevention efforts while including risk factors specific to PWH.	[Womack, Julie A.

A two-stage voltage control strategy of ADN is proposed by the authors based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with refined power to hydrogen (P2H) model, considering multiple types of PV forms such as residential photovoltaic cluster (RPVC) and small-scale PV power stations. In the day-ahead stage, the optimal power flow is performed to determine the optimal scheduling results of on-load tap changers and capacitor banks etc. In the intra-day stage, the real-time voltage control strategy is implemented at the distribution network layer to regulate the power of each type of PV, energy storage systems and P2H to further reduce the voltage deviation. At the customer layer, the residential photovoltaic (RPV) within the RPVC is precisely controlled based on the ADMM algorithm to achieve the minimum voltage deviation at each RPV access point. The proposed strategy is tested on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus distribution systems, and the simulation results verify its effectiveness in mitigating voltage violations.

Therefore, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one-pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs were successfully produced by the designed microbial consortia-based biocatalytic system. In particular, the highest biosynthesis productivity record of 1,6-hexanediamine was achieved when using either cyclohexanol or cyclohexane as a substrate. Thus, the developed biocatalytic process provides a promising alternative to the dominant industrial process for manufacturing DAs.

The osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells BMSCs is critical for maxillofacial osteogenesis and functional reconstruction. Here, our study focused on the functions and mechanism of N-6-methyladenosine during BMSCs osteogenic differentiation BMSCs.Subject and Methods: Biofunctions of BMSCs were detected using ALP activity and alizarin red S staining assays. The molecular interaction within RNA/protein was identified by RNA immunoprecipitation and/or methylation immunoprecipitation.Results: Results indicated that m(6)A 'writer' METTL3 upregulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs upon osteogenic induction. Functionally, assays' results revealed that METTL3 overexpression promoted the osteogenic differentiation of BMSC, while METTL3 knockdown repressed the osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, results revealed that RUNX2 mRNA was a m(6)A-methylated target by METTL3 at its 3'-UTR. Moreover, m(6)A reader IGF2BP1 recognized the m(6)A site on RUNX2 mRNA to enhance its stability.Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings revealed the novel roles of METTL3 in BMSCs osteogenic differentiation via the IGF2BP1/m(6)A/RUNX2 signaling axis of m(6)A-dependent manner, providing a potential therapeutic target for maxillofacial bone defects treatment.

Extremally rare cause of AV block during typical atrial flutter ablation not related to conduction tissue injury	PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						ablation; clinical; electrophysiology		Background: 51-year-old female with extensive prior atrial surgery involving myxoma resection and patch septum repair and prior typical atrial flutter as well as peripatch reentry underwent redo radiofrequency ablation of typical atrial flutter. Methods: After high density mapping was performed, and gap in the prior typical flutter line was ablated. Result: During the ablation transient atrioventricular (AV) block was noted. Subsequent remapping of the right atrium revealed that there was a narrow strip of tissue between the cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) and the coronary sinus (CS) os on which activation of the AV node was now depending. From all other directions, the AV node was surrounded by scar tissue. Conclusions: The most likely explanation for the transient AV block during the ablation procedure is that there was reversible injury to the tissue strip between the CTI and the CS os, which is critical for the activation of the AV node.

Silk displays prodigious heterogeneity in its genetic structure and physical properties in accordance with the spinning and storage process, where proteins undergo folding and unfolding. The stimuli-responsive nature of silk can be explained with the help of the structural morphology and composition of the material, where the hydrogen bonds in beta-sheet domains and amorphous region act as switch points and net points, respectively. This review provides a primary attempt to enswathe all the literature available to date on the stimuli-responsive nature of silk and silk-based materials as a natural and biodegradable alternative for commercially used synthetic shape memory materials taking their elastomeric nature and reduction in glass transition temperature into account. Further constitutive model using the continuum approach has been utilized to explain the anisotropic elasticity damping effect and plastic deformation based on the alpha-helix chains, beta-sheets, and beta-spiral structures. The practicability to develop biomedical devices such as patient-specific-injectable scaffolds, drug carriers, and artificial muscles has been encompassed in this article.

In developing and validating the new AAJCS, we, first, developed the German items in a stepwise procedure (pilot study). Second, we tested the factor structure and reliability (Study 1). Third, we replicated previous results and tested the construct validity (Study 2). Fourth, we ensured the criterion validity of the AAJCS (Study 3). The results suggested the existence of two independent factors, namely, approach and avoidance crafting, rather than a global job crafting factor. Furthermore, approach and avoidance crafting each consist of four job crafting dimensions, thus reflecting the hierarchical structure of job crafting. Within these dimensions, aspects of previous job crafting concepts are integrated. The distinction between approach and avoidance crafting became apparent in the comparison of their criterion validities as follows: Approach crafting was positively related to work-related outcomes, while avoidance crafting was negatively associated with work engagement and performance. Furthermore, approach and avoidance crafting exhibited incremental validity with regard to predict work engagement and performance beyond previous job crafting concepts. Approach crafting was positively associated while avoidance crafting was negatively associated with work engagement and performance.

National Identities and Support for a Differentiated EU	JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						differentiated integration; identity; postfunctionalism; public opinion	PUBLIC SUPPORT; EUROPEAN INTEGRATION; COLLECTIVE IDENTITIES; OPINION; POLITICIZATION; PREFERENCES; UNION	An extensive literature investigates individual support for European integration. However, support for differentiated integration has only recently become an important topic of study for public opinion scholars. Previous literature on this issue has not probed how differentiated integration is shaped by exclusively national identities and whether the effect varies by how differentiation has been framed. Using survey data from 2020 to 2021, I show that exclusively national citizens are most likely to support differentiated integration that allows for greater national autonomy and may oppose differentiation whose primary goal is to facilitate further integration. However, I find no clear link between elite framing of differentiated integration and popular support for it. This raises important questions both about what kind of differentiated integration will enjoy public legitimacy and how cues shape support for European Union (EU) differentiation.

However, previous studies usually used average wind speed or rated wind speed as inputs, ignoring the impact of time and space distribution on wind speed. Based on the hourly ground observation data of meteorological stations, four observation stations are taken as the research object of the uncertainty of wind speed spatial distribution. The four observation stations are divided into single day and one week, and seven data analysis indicators and normal distribution models are used day and night to analyze the uncertainty of wind speed time distribution. The results show that both spatial distribution and temporal distribution are important factors that cause the uncertainty of wind speed. Due to different geographical locations of four stations, their wind speed time domain diagrams are different, and the maximum wind speed, fluctuation frequency and fluctuation amplitude of wind speed at each observation station are different; The wind speed distribution of a single day is quite different from that of a week. The data of a single day and a week are analyzed by day and night, which is quite different from the overall data analysis. The necessity of wind speed uncertainty research of wind turbine considering the temporal and spatial distribution is verified, and it is concluded that normal distribution is not suitable for fitting the distribution model of four stations under study, which lays a foundation for determining the wind speed distribution model, analyzing the power characteristics of wind turbine, evaluating the generation capacity of wind turbine, and analyzing the reliability of wind turbine.

Single nucleotide variations encoding missense mutations in G protein-coupled receptors may contribute to autism	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						autism spectrum disorder; G protein-coupled receptors; Missense mutation; Single nucleotide variation	DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; GASTRIN-RELEASING-PEPTIDE; SPECTRUM DISORDER; HIS452TYR POLYMORPHISM; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; CODING VARIANTS; GENE; AGONIST; ASSOCIATION; CHILDREN	Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition with a range of symptoms that vary in intensity and severity from person to person. Genetic sequencing has identified thousands of genes containing mutations in autistic individuals, which may contribute to the development of autistic symptoms. Several of these genes encode G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are cell surface expressed proteins that transduce extracellular messages to the intracellular space. Mutations in GPCRs can impact their function, resulting in aberrant signalling within cells and across neurotransmitter systems in the brain. This review summarises the current knowledge on autism-associated single nucleotide variations encoding missense mutations in GPCRs and the impact of these genetic mutations on GPCR function. For some autism-associated mutations, changes in GPCR expression levels, ligand affinity, potency and efficacy have been observed. However, for many the functional consequences remain unknown. Thus, further work to characterise the functional impacts of the genetically identified mutations is required.

Real-time monitoring of cytokines in vivo is helpful for assessing the immune status of patients and providing an early warning of a cytokine storm. In this study, a functional carbon nanotube biointerface-based wearable microneedle patches for real-time monitoring of a cytokine storm in vivo via electrochemical analysis are reported. This wearable system has sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.54 pg mL(-1), high specificity, and 5 days of stability with a coefficient of variation of 4.0%. The system also has a quick response of several hours (1-4 h) to increasing cytokines. This wearable microneedle patch may offer a promising route for real-time biomolecule wearables construction. The patch is also the first reported integrated capture and monitoring system that is capable of real-time measurement of protein markers in interstitial fluid.

Here, biodegradable and charge-switchable phytoglycogen nanoparticles capable of glucose-stimulated insulin release are engineered. The nanoparticles are "nanosugars" bearing glucose-sensitive phenylboronic acid groups and amine moieties that allow effective complexation with insulin (approximate to 95% loading capacity) to form nanocomplexes. A single subcutaneous injection of nanocomplexes shows a rapid and efficient response to a glucose challenge in two distinct diabetic mouse models, resulting in optimal blood glucose levels (below 200 mg dL(-1)) for up to 13 h. The morphology of the nanocomplexes is found to be key to controlling rapid and extended glucose-regulated insulin delivery in vivo. These studies reveal that the injected nanocomplexes enabled efficient insulin release in the mouse, with optimal bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles. These results highlight a promising strategy for the development of a glucose-responsive insulin delivery system based on a natural and biodegradable nanosugar.

We used state-of-the-art network and machine learning methodologies to identify symptoms, as well as relations thereof, that bridge depression and mania. MethodsObservational study that used mental health data (12 symptoms for depression and 12 for mania) from a large, representative Canadian sample (the Canadian Community Health Survey of 2002). Complete data (N = 36,557; 54.6% female) were analysed using network psychometrics, in conjunction with a random forest algorithm, to examine the bidirectional interplay of depressive and manic symptoms. ResultsCentrality analyses pointed to symptoms relating to emotionality and hyperactivity as being the most central aspects of depression and mania, respectively. The two syndromes were spatially segregated in the bipolar model and four symptoms appeared crucial in bridging them: sleep disturbances (insomnia and hypersomnia), anhedonia, suicidal ideation, and impulsivity. Our machine learning algorithm validated the clinical utility of central and bridge symptoms (in the prediction of lifetime episodes of mania and depression), and suggested that centrality, but not bridge, metrics map almost perfectly onto a data-driven measure of diagnostic utility. ConclusionsOur results replicate key findings from past network studies on bipolar disorder, but also extend them by highlighting symptoms that bridge the two bipolar poles, while also demonstrating their clinical utility.

Despite the increased scholarly and practical interest, understanding how such spaces are initiated and sustained remains scarce. In this study, we focus on a national data economy initiative to investigate a virtual and mental space where relevant and interested cross-sectoral parties can join, share information and identify shared interests for research and development in the data economy. We investigate the early phases of collaborative innovation through the lens of liminality and show how individuals' sensemaking narratives manifest the different dimensions of liminality. We contribute to the research on collaborative innovation and spaces by theorising liminality in the context of our paper as a three-dimensional concept of confusion-clarity, isolation-communal, and stagnation-movement that creates a threshold for collaborative innovation. Our study offers a more nuanced understanding of the less studied, yet critical, early phase of collaborative innovation, hence contributing to the research and practice of the emergence of collaborative innovation.

Studies are showing an increase in oxidative stress markers and a decrease in some antioxidant enzymes in individuals with autism. This study aims to try to explain the effect of nutritional interventions that reduce oxidative stress on behavioural and gastrointestinal problems in ASD based on a literature review. MethodsAll relevant studies from 2000 to 2021 were identified through a systematic search in the PubMed and Web of Science databases by using key search terms. A systematic search of the electronic databases resulted in a total of 3235 potential articles, and data were extracted from 24 studies. ResultsThere were 9 clinical trials and 15 animal studies. Most studies find statistically significant results for nutritional supplementation compared with placebo ASD symptoms. ConclusionMost studies on the interventions of nutritional supplements that reduce oxidative stress in individuals with ASD have found improving effects on ASD symptoms, and no serious side effects have been observed. However, more interventional studies are needed to determine the precise effects of oxidative stress-reducing nutritional supplementation.

Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between delirium prevalence and being prescribed ACEI and ARB in participants admitted to the intensive care units (ICU).Methods: A secondary analysis of data from two parallel pragmatic randomized controlled trials was performed. ACEI and ARB exposure was defined as being prescribed an ACEI or an ARB within six months prior to the ICU admission. The primary endpoint was the first positive delirium assessment based on Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) for up to thirty days.Results: A total of 4791 patients admitted to the medical, surgical, and progressive ICU and screened for eligibility for the parent studies between February 2009 and January 2015 from two level 1 trauma and one safety net hospital in a large urban academic health system were included. Delirium rates in the ICU were not significantly different among participants with no exposure to ACEI/ARB (12.6%), or exposure to ACEI (14.4%), ARB (11.8%), or ACEI and ARB in combination (15.4%) in six months prior to the ICU admission. Exposure to ACEI (OR = 0.97[0.77, 1.22]), ARB (OR = 0.70 [0.47, 1.05]), or both (OR = 0.97 [0.33, 2.89]) in six months prior to ICU admission was not significantly associated with odds of delirium during the ICU admission after adjusting for age, gender, race, co-morbidities, and insurance status.Conclusions: While the impact of ACEI and ARB exposure prior to the ICU admission was not associated with the prevalence of delirium in this study, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of antihypertensive medications on delirium.

Natural variation of<i> Macrocystis</i><i> pyrifera</i> gametophyte germplasm culture microbiomes and applications for improving yield in offshore farms	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY			English	Article						aquaculture; bacteria; biofuel; growth promoting; inoculant; metagenomics; seaweed	PHOSPHATE-SOLUBILIZING BACTERIA; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; GIANT-KELP; GROWTH PROMOTION; TEMPERATURE; MAIZE; SEED; L.	With national interest in seaweed-based biofuels as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, there is a need for tools that produce high-yield seaweed cultivars and increase the efficiency of offshore farms. Several agricultural studies have demonstrated that the application of microbial inoculants at an early life stage can improve crop yield, and there is an opportunity to use similar techniques in seaweed aquaculture. However, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding host-microbiome associations of macroalgae gametophytes in germplasm cultures. Here, we investigate the microbial community of Macrocystis pyrifera gametophyte germplasm cultures that were used to cultivate an offshore farm in Santa Barbara, California and identify key taxa correlated with increased biomass of mature sporophytes. This work provides a valuable knowledge base for the development of microbial inoculants that produce high-biomass M. pyrifera cultivars to ultimately be used as biofuel feedstocks.

MethodsThis longitudinal analysis was based on baseline, 12 and 24 months follow-up data of 352 patients with dementia. The impact of Lvm on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), hospitalizations, and health care costs were assessed using multiple panel-specific regression models. ResultsOver 24 months, 182 patients (52%) received Lvm at least once and 56 (16%) continuously. Lvm significantly increased the risk of hospitalization by 49% (odds ratio, confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.06-2.09; p = 0.022), increased health care costs by euro6810 (CI 95% -707euro-14,27euro; p = 0.076), and reduced patients' HRQoL (b = -1.55; CI 95% -2.76 to -0.35; p = 0.011). DiscussionMore than every second patient received Lvm, negatively impacting patient-reported HRQoL, hospitalizations, and costs. Innovative approaches are needed to encourage prescribers to avoid and replace Lvm in dementia care. HighlightsOver 24 months, more than every second patient received low-value medications (Lvm).Lvm negatively impact physical, psychological, and financial outcomes.Appropriate measures are needed to change prescription behaviors.

It is observed that, the addition of trialkyl borates during polycondensation reaction results in the formation of high molecular weight PBS. This might be due to the activation of free terminal carboxylic acids in PBS oligomer by trialkyl borates via the formation of highly reactive acyloxyboron intermediate. A plausible mechanism for the activation of free terminal carboxylic acids by trialkoxy borates has also been proposed.	[Savitha, K. S.; Jagadish, R.

ObjectivesTo understand the nature and severity of burden in care partners of PwPD during the ongoing pandemic. We also sought to describe care partners' perceived change in burden and factors associated with increased burden. MethodsCross-sectional online questionnaire-based study among care partners of PwPD, registered in the Fox Insight study. The questionnaire consisted of the Modified Caregiver Strain Index, whether an aspect of strain had changed over the course of the pandemic and additional pandemic-specific infection and lifestyle-related items. ResultsTwo hundred seventy-three non-paid primary care partners responded to the questionnaire, 73% female with a median age at enrollment of 64 years, 56% reporting a household income greater than 75,000 USD per year, and 61% retired. An increase in burden compared to before the pandemic was prevalent, ranging from 33% to 63% for individual items. Emotional strain increased most frequently (63%). Decreases in burden were uncommon; work adjustments (7%) and time demands (6%) decreased most frequently. PD-related factors and care partner roles in personal care of the PwPD were the factors that were associated with strain in multivariable analysis, whereas social and pandemic-related factors were not. ConclusionIn this affluent and mostly retired cohort, increases in emotional strain during the pandemic were prevalent. Despite this, caregiving roles in personal care and severity of symptoms in the PwPD were more strongly associated with strain than social and pandemic-related factors.	[Speelberg, Daniel H.

J	Wang, WX; Zhu, YD; Sang, SM				Wang, Weixin; Zhu, Yingdong; Sang, Shengmin			Barley Phenolamides Effectively Scavenge Harmful Methylglyoxal In Vitro and in Mice	MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH			English	Article						barley phenolamides; diabetes; MGO adducts of phenolamides; MGO trapping; mouse studies	GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS; GENISTEIN; PLASMA	ScopeMethylglyoxal (MGO), a harmful reactive dicarbonyl, is involved in the pathogenesis and development of diabetes and diabetic complications. The goal of this study is to determine whether bioactive phenolamides in barley, p-coumaroylagmatine (pCAA) and feruloylagmatine (FAA), which share a similar guanidine group to diabetic drug metformin, have the capacity to detoxify MGO. Methods and resultsIn this study, the MGO-trapping abilities of these two phenolamides both in vitro and in mice are evaluated. It is found that in vitro anti-MGO capacities of pCAA and FAA are comparable to that of metformin, and both phenolamides could rapidly scavenge MGO via forming mono- and di-MGO adducts validated by in-house synthesized standards and interpretation of respective LC-MSn (n = 2-3) data. Furthermore, mono-MGO conjugates of phenolamides are detected from feces and urine of mice after oral administration of the corresponding phenolamides. ConclusionThese findings suggest that barley phenolamides may have the potentials to be developed as alternative therapeutics to prevent the development of MGO-associated diabetes and diabetic complications.

First, a series of terpolymers (PNAM) of acrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, and maleic anhydride was prepared via free radical copolymerization. Next, PNAM, poly(allylaminehydrochloride), and quaternary chitosan were dissolved in water, rapid gelation was observed after the pH of the solution was adjusted to alkaline. Then, single-factor experiments were applied to optimize the preparation parameters. The hydrogel was found to be thermal/pH sensitive. Finally, choosing Eosin Y as a model dye, the effect of the initial concentration, temperature, contact time, adsorbent dosage, ionic strength, and pH on the adsorption behavior was studied. The adsorption capacity could reach 1799 mg/g under optimized conditions. The adsorption performance of the hydrogels can be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir model. The thermodynamic study suggests that the adsorption of Eosin Y is a spontaneous, endothermic, and entropy-increasing process. In view of its adsorption performance and facile preparation process, the hydrogel is expected to be used as a promising adsorbent.

Combining datasets to routinely predict fusarium head blight resistance in a wheat breeding program	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access							TRAINING POPULATION DESIGN; GENOMIC PREDICTION; SELECTION; ACCURACY; DEOXYNIVALENOL; REGISTRATION; INDIVIDUALS; STABILITY; GENOTYPE; EFFICACY	Fusarium head blight (FHB; Fusarium graminearum Schwabe) is a devastating fungal disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that can significantly reduce yield and grain quality. Datasets from different stages of field evaluation can be combined into a training population to predict FHB resistance. Our objective was to determine if FHB resistance among F-5 lines can be predicted accurately with historical lines, parental lines, and a subset of F-5 lines. Lines at the F-5 and preliminary yield trial (PYT) stages in the University of Minnesota wheat breeding program were evaluated in two locations from 2016 to 2020 and were genotyped with 3679 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Historical datasets with 368 to 3015 lines had predictive abilities of -0.01 to 0.20, whereas F-5 subsets had predictive abilities of 0.04-0.32. Adding subsets of F-5 lines to the historical datasets led to incremental improvements in predictive abilities in most cases, especially when the subset was selected via the pedigree or k-means approach. The most effective training populations were those that contained a subset of 200 F-5 lines chosen via the k-means method, the F-5 parents, and the PYT lines tested in the same year, with predictive abilities that were usually higher than that of the F-5 subset. We have started to use such combinations of datasets to routinely predict FHB resistance of F-5 lines in our breeding program.

The first downstream unit operation is the clarification of the cell culture broth to remove various insoluble (such as cells and cell debris) and soluble (such as host cell DNA and proteins) contaminants, pro-ducing a feed stream suitable for further downstream purification. The high cell-density cultures obtained in modern intensi-fied bioprocessing have made legacy single-use clarification trains (based primarily on depth filtration of the cell culture broth) ineffective and impractical, significantly increasing the economic and material burden of the clarification process.RESULTS: We have developed and characterized approaches that enable intensification of the clarification operation, by increasing process capacities while reducing material requirements and footprint, for single-use manufacturing facilities. These approaches are based on primary clarification using the Alfa Laval CultureOneTM centrifuge (a continuous solid discharge disc-stack centrifuge with a single-use flow path) followed by secondary clarification using single-use disposable depth filters. We show that these intensified clarification trains are suitable for processing high cell-density cultures (6-12% packed cell volume) with significantly high yields (>= 90%) and impurity clearance, along with reduced operating costs (30-60% savings).CONCLUSION: Incorporating a single-use continuous discharge centrifuge into the clarification train enables clarification of high cell-density cultures in single-use manufacturing facilities and enhances process economic and environmental sustainability.(c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

Rheological assessment of metakaolin-based geopolymer composites through squeeze flow	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article						aluminosilicates; geopolymers; packing; rheology; rheometry	EXTRUSION; BEHAVIOR	Geopolymer (GP) composites show great potential as a replacement for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in construction material, extrusion-based, and additive manufacturing. The rheological properties of highly viscous and reinforced systems have not yet been well studied, due to limitations in the current state of the art rheometers and viscometers, such as size and torque limits. In this study, the basic rheological properties of highly reinforced, geopolymer composites with potential for 3D printing are innovatively investigated with "squeeze flow" and "flow table" tests commonly used in civil engineering. Squeeze-flow rates of 0.1, 1.0, and 3.0 mm/s were assessed with varying sand weight percentages or basalt fiber lengths and compared to a conventional OPC mixture to differentiate the flow properties and deformation resistance of both materials. It is shown that the deformation resistance as a result of jamming increases with increasing solid reinforcement percentages, but that the overall effect of fiber size is somewhat inconclusive. In addition, the effect of squeeze-flow rate exhibits an increase in load required to initiate flow at lower squeezing rates, but, upon reaching a certain ratio of solids to liquid in the matrix, the results become variable.

Materials and MethodsA validated dynamic in vitro multispecies biofilm model, based on bacterial growth under flow and shear conditions resembling the oral cavity, was used to evaluate biofilm formation on the tested implant surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to compare the biofilm structure and microbial biomass deposited on either the moderately rough or the turned surface of HS. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to evaluate the total bacterial counts and counts of each specific bacterium in biofilms formed on implants with either the moderately rough or the turned surfaces, as in the hybrid titanium implants, after 24, 48 and 72 h. A general linear model was applied to compare the CLSM and qPCR results between the tested implant surfaces. ResultsA significantly higher bacterial biomass grew on the moderately rough implant surfaces, compared to the turned surface area of HS implants (p < .05), at all incubation times, as evidenced with both CLSM and SEM. qPCR analysis also demonstrated an important increase in the total and specific bacterial counts in moderately rough surface implants at the three incubation times. ConclusionsImplant surface topography (moderately rough versus turned) significantly influenced in vitro biofilm formation in terms of biofilm structure, bacterial biomass and quantity of the specific species selected for the model used.

Improving efficiency of methods for hatchery production of the limpet <i>Patella candei</i> (Patellogastropoda: Patellidae)	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article						artificial maturation; hatchery technologies; larval density; larval production; larviculture	LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; STOCKING DENSITY; MOLLUSCA; MATURATION; GASTROPODA; GROWTH; METAMORPHOSIS; EVOLUTION; SURVIVAL; FERTILIZATION	Patella candei d'Orbigny, 1840 is a valuable resource from the European Macaronesia. Limpet aquaculture is a recent research field that could contribute to reducing anthropogenic impact and developing appropriate restocking technologies. This study presents the results of 14 assays performed under laboratory culture conditions aimed at: (1) improving the larval production methodologies for limpets through the optimization of the artificial maturation of the oocytes and the sperm density required for fertilization and incubation, (2) validating a larviculture protocol for P. candei, and (3) evaluating rearing density effect on larvae performance until the pediveliger stage. Results obtained in the present study indicate that NH4OH is more efficient than KOH and NaOH to enhance the artificial maturation of the oocytes. The optimal combination was NH4OH at pH 9.0 for a duration of 20-30 min. The optimal sperm density was approximately 10(5) sperm cells mL(-1) as in other limpet species. The larviculture method described hereby demonstrated to be efficient to obtain viable pediveligers, that is, the larval survival was high, and the artificial maturation did not influence negatively the posterior larval development. The rearing density, within a range from 2.5 to 30 larvae mL(-1), showed minimal influence on survival and development.	[Castejon, Diego; Garcia, Loreto; Nogueira, Natacha; Andrade, Carlos A.

The COVID-19 pandemic tested the ability of perinatal care systems to respond to extreme disruption. Many childbearing people in the United States opted out of the mainstream choice of hospital birth during the pandemic, leading to a 19.5% increase in community birth between 2019 and 2020. The aim of the study was to understand the experiences and priorities of childbearing people as they sought to preserve a safe and satisfying birth during the time of extreme health care disruption caused by the pandemic. MethodsThis exploratory qualitative study recruited participants from a sample of respondents to a national-scope web-based survey that explored experiences of pregnancy and birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maximal variation sampling was used to invite survey respondents who had considered a variety of birth setting, perinatal care provider, and care model options to participate in individual interviews. A conventional content analysis approach was used with coding categories derived directly from the transcribed interviews. ResultsInterviews were conducted with 18 individuals. Results were reported around 4 domains: (1) respect and autonomy in decision-making, (2) high-quality care, (3) safety, and (4) risk assessment and informed choice. Respect and autonomy varied by birth setting and perinatal care provider type. Quality of care and safety were described in relational and physical terms. Childbearing people prioritized alignment with their personal philosophies toward birth as they weighed safety. Although levels of stress and fear were elevated, many felt empowered by the sudden opportunity to consider new options. DiscussionDisaster preparedness and health system strengthening should address the importance childbearing people place on the relational aspects of care, need for options in decision-making, timely and accurate information sharing, and opportunity for a range of safe and supported birth settings. Mechanisms are needed to build system-level changes that respond to the self-expressed needs and priorities of childbearing people.

Here, an ultra-broadband, tunable, and transparent microwave meta-absorber comprising double-layer indium tin oxide resonant patterns and a water-based substrate is theoretically presented and experimentally demonstrated. Experimental measurements indicate that the designed meta-absorber can achieve over 90% absorption in an ultra-broadband frequency range of 12.49-98.21 GHz with a relative bandwidth of 154.9%, while the average optical transmittance is 60.49%. In addition, a multiple reflections interference model is employed to elucidate the physical mechanisms of the ultra-broadband absorber. Furthermore, its absorption performance can be reversibly switched between ultra-broadband and dual-broadband by altering the water substrate thickness. These peculiar properties make the proposed meta-absorber more favorable for practical applications in modern stealth materials and optical windows.

Materials and MethodsSeventy-eight patients underwent two CTC scans: conventional 120 kVp in supine position (Group A) with 30% Adaptive statistical iteration algorithm (ASIR-V) and BMI-based lower kV p in prone position (Group B): tube voltage was suggested by an experienced investigator according to the patient's body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight divided by height squared; kg/m (2)).70 kV for BMI < 23 kg/m(2) (Group B1, n = 27), 80 kV for 23 <= BMI <= 25 kg/m(2)(Group B2, n = 21) and 100 kV for BMI > 25 kg/m(2) (Group B3, n = 30). Group A, corresponding to the BMI value in Group B, was divided into A1, A2, and A3 subgroups for analysis. Groups B used ASIR-V of different weights (30%-90% ASIR-V). The Hounsfield Unit (HU) and SD values of the muscles and the intestinal cavity air were measured, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of images were calculated. Imaging quality was evaluated by two reviewers and statistically compared. ResultsThe 120 kV scans were preferred more than 50% of the time. All images had excellent quality with good consistency between reviewers (Kappa > 0.75, p < 0.05). The radiation dose was reduced in groups B1, B2 and B3 by 63.62%, 44.63%, and 32.14%, respectively, compared with group A (p < 0.05). The SNR and CNR values between group A1/A2/A3 and B1/B2/B3 + 60%ASIR-V were not statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the subjective scores of group B combined with 60%ASIR-V and group A (p > 0.05). ConclusionBMI-based individualized kV CTC imaging significantly reduces overall radiation dose while providing an equal image quality with the conventional 120 kV.

Much of the available data on metal toxicity to microalgae have been derived from temperate single-species tests with temperate data used to supplement tropical toxicity data sets to derive guideline values. In the present study, we used single-species and multispecies tests to investigate the toxicity of nickel and copper to tropical freshwater and marine microalgae, including the free-swimming stage of Symbiodinium sp., a worldwide coral endosymbiont. Based on the 10% effect concentration (EC10) for growth rate, copper was two to four times more toxic than nickel to all species tested. The temperate strain of Ceratoneis closterium was eight to 10 times more sensitive to nickel than the two tropical strains. Freshwater Monoraphidium arcuatum was less sensitive to copper and nickel in the multispecies tests compared with the single-species tests (EC10 values increasing from 0.45 to 1.4 mu g Cu/L and from 62 to 330 mu g Ni/L). The Symbiodinium sp. was sensitive to copper (EC10 of 3.1 mu g Cu/L) and less sensitive to nickel (EC50 >1600 mu g Ni/L). This is an important contribution of data on the chronic toxicity of nickel to Symbiodinium sp. A key result from the present study was that three microalgal species had EC10 values below the current copper water quality guideline value for 95% species protection in slightly to moderately disturbed systems in Australia and New Zealand, indicating that they may not be adequately protected by the current copper guideline value. By contrast, toxicity of nickel to microalgae is unlikely to occur at exposure concentrations typically found in fresh and marine waters. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;00:1-13. (c) 2023 The Authors.

However, the method poses analytical challenges and there is no widely adopted standardised approach to collecting these data or correcting the numerous potential isobaric inferences. Here, we outline practical analytical procedures and data reduction strategies to help establish a consistent framework for collecting and correcting Sr isotope measurements in geological materials by LA-MC-ICP-MS. We characterise a new set of plagioclase reference materials, which are available for distribution to the community, and present a new data reduction scheme for the Iolite software package to correct isobaric interferences for different materials and analytical conditions. Our tests show that a combination of Kr-baseline subtraction, Rb-peak-stripping using beta Rb derived from a bracketing glass reference material, and a CaCa or CaAr correction for plagioclase and CaCa or CaAr + REE2+ correction for rock glasses, yields the most accurate and precise Sr-87/Sr-86 measurements for these materials. Using the analytical and correction procedures outlined herein, spot analyses using a beam diameter of 100 mu m or rastering with a 50-65 mu m diameter beam can readily achieve < 100 ppm 2SE repeatability ("internal") precision for Sr-87/Sr-86 measurements for materials with < 1000 mu g g(-1) Sr.	[Mulder, Jacob; Ubide, Teresa] Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Mulder, Jacob] Univ Adelaide, Dept Earth Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Hagen-Peter, Graham; Andreasen, Rasmus; Tegner, Christian; Lesher, Charles] Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, Aarhus, Denmark; [Hagen-Peter, Graham] Geol Survey Norway, Trondheim, Norway; [Kooijman, Ellen; Kielman-Schmitt, Melanie; Karlsson, Andreas] Vegacenter, Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Stockholm, Sweden; [Feng, Yue-Xing] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Paul, Bence] Univ Melbourne, Sch Geog Earth & Atmospher Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Paul, Bence] LLC Bozeman, Elemental Sci Lasers, Bozeman, MT 59718 USA; [Lesher, Charles] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Davis, CA USA; [Costa, Fidel] Inst Phys Globe Paris, Paris, France	University of Queensland; University of Adelaide; Aarhus University; Geological Survey of Norway; Swedish Museum of Natural History; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory; Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai); University of Melbourne; University of California System; University of California Davis; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Cite	Mulder, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Mulder, J (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Dept Earth Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia.	jack.mulder@adelaide.edu.au	Kooijman, Ellen/H-7507-2012; Tegner, Christian/A-5295-2012; Ubide, Teresa/L-8225-2016	Tegner, Christian/0000-0003-1407-7298; Ubide, Teresa/0000-0002-2944-8736; Mulder, Jacob/0000-0001-6197-0439; Karlsson, Andreas/0000-0002-5390-0577; Andreasen, Rasmus/0000-0001-9737-1243	University of Queensland [UQ-FREA RM2019001828]; Advance Queensland Women's Research Assistance Program from the Queensland Government [WRAP109-2019RD1 RM2020002371]; Australian Synchrotron [RM2018002281, 2021-00276]; AuScope (National Research Infrastructure for Australia); Danish National Research Foundation; Carlsberg Foundation; Aarhus University; Swedish Research Council; American Museum of Natural History;  [AS183/XFM/13961]	University of Queensland(University of Queensland); Advance Queensland Women's Research Assistance Program from the Queensland Government; Australian Synchrotron; AuScope (National Research Infrastructure for Australia); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); Aarhus University; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); American Museum of Natural History; 	TU acknowledges funding from a Foundation Research Excellence Award from The University of Queensland (UQ-FREA RM2019001828), the Advance Queensland Women's Research Assistance Program from the Queensland Government (WRAP109-2019RD1 RM2020002371), the Australian Synchrotron, part of ANSTO (X-ray fluorescence microscopy beamline experiment AS183/XFM/13961 RM2018002281), and AuScope (National Research Infrastructure for Australia).

To estimate the performance of machine learning models, k-fold cross-validation (k-CV) is widely used. However, if only limited data are available and the data distribution is biased, k-CV tends to overestimate the performance for practical applications. This study proposed a new estimator, leave one reference out and k-CV (LORO-k-CV), to determine the practical performance of machine learning models, that is, the generalization performance for population data in the target task, in case data are collected by multiple references resulting in biased data. LORO-k-CV is a combination of a new concept, LORO-CV, that estimates the performance in the extrapolation region of the training data without human intervention and k-CV, considering the ratio of the interpolation and extrapolation regions. The efficacy of LORO-k-CV was validated with its application to the regression task for the chloride-ion concentration of concrete structures. To more specifically demonstrate the advantages of LORO-k-CV in model construction, the feature selections were conducted using both k-CV and LORO-k-CV methods. These results revealed that LORO-k-CV can effectively construct a model with improved generalization performance even from the same data in cases where data are collected by multiple references, resulting in biased data.

The prevalence and phenotypic range associated with biallelic <i>PKDCC</i> variants	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						bone diseases; medical genetics; skeletal dysplasia; whole genome sequencing		PKDCC encodes a component of Hedgehog signalling required for normal chondrogenesis and skeletal development. Although biallelic PKDCC variants have been implicated in rhizomelic shortening of limbs with variable dysmorphic features, this association was based on just two patients. In this study, data from the 100 000 Genomes Project was used in conjunction with exome sequencing and panel-testing results accessed via international collaboration to assemble a cohort of eight individuals from seven independent families with biallelic PKDCC variants. The allelic series included six frameshifts, a previously described splice-donor site variant and a likely pathogenic missense variant observed in two families that was supported by in silico structural modelling. Database queries suggested that the prevalence of this condition is between 1 of 127 and 1 of 721 in clinical cohorts with skeletal dysplasia of unknown aetiology. Clinical assessments, combined with data from previously published cases, indicate a predominantly upper limb involvement. Micrognathia, hypertelorism and hearing loss appear to be commonly co-occurring features. In conclusion, this study strengthens the link between biallelic inactivation of PKDCC and rhizomelic limb-shortening and will enable clinical testing laboratories to better interpret variants in this gene.

AAPM task group report 275.S: Survey strategy and results on plan review and chart check practices in US and Canada	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Review						plan and chart check; plan review; survey results	RADIATION ONCOLOGY	BackgroundAAPM Task Group (TG) 275 was charged with developing practical, evidence-based recommendations for physics plan and chart review clinical processes for radiation therapy. As part of this charge, and to characterize practices and clinical processes, a survey of the medical physics community was developed and conducted. Detailed analyses and trends based on the survey that exceeded TG report length constraints are presented herein. AimsThe design, development, and detailed results of the TG- 275 survey as well as statistical analysis and trends are described in detail. This is complementary material to the TG 275 report. Methods and materialsThe survey consisted of 100 multiple-choice questions divided into four main sections: 1) Demographics, 2) Initial Plan Check, 3) On-Treatment, and 4) End-of-Treatment Chart Check. The survey was released to all AAPM members who self-reported working in the radiation oncology field, and it was kept open for 7 weeks. Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. To study practice differences, tests of association were performed using data grouped by four demographic questions: 1) Institution Type, 2) Average number of patients treated daily, 3) Radiation Oncology Electronic Medical Record, and 4) Perceived Culture of Safety. ResultsThe survey captured 1370 non-duplicate entries from the United States and Canada. Differences across practices were grouped and presented based on Process-Based and Check-Specific questions. A risk-based summary was created to show differences amongst the four demographic questions for checks associated with the highest risk failure modes identified by TG-275. ConclusionThe TG-275 survey captured a baseline of practices on initial plan, on-treatment, and end-of-treatment checks across a wide variety of clinics and institutions. The results of test of association showed practice heterogeneities as a function of demographic characteristics. Survey data were successfully used to inform TG-275 recommendations.

Functional community structure modulates zooplankton production rates across boreal lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity; crustaceans; ecosystem function; feeding traits; selection effect	WATER CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; R PACKAGE; BIODIVERSITY; BIOMASS; CONSEQUENCES; MAGNITUDE; FRAMEWORK; PATTERNS; IDENTITY	Although there is a general consensus in ecology that more diverse communities tend to be more productive, it is still unclear whether this holds for aquatic ecosystems, especially with indicators of productivity rates and not just standing biomass proxies. Furthermore, most evidence is based on the results of experimental studies in which biodiversity was assessed through taxonomic richness, although functional indicators could be more relevant. Consequently, we still have a poor understanding of how real community performance is linked to the various features of community structure in natural aquatic ecosystems. Here we explicitly assessed the effect of functional traits and diversity on crustacean zooplankton productivity rates measured across 84 boreal Canadian lakes spanning wide limnological gradients. Productivity was assessed using the chitobiase enzyme method. Redundancy analyses and structured equation modelling were used to assess the relationship between zooplankton production rates, community structure (diversity and functional composition), while accounting for standing biomass and environmental factors After controlling for the effect of environmental factors, zooplankton production rates were positively linked to dominance (lower functional evenness) by certain feeding traits (Daphnia filtration and Chydorus filtration), demonstrating an identity (selection) effect. Overall, the magnitude of the functional compositional effect on production was comparable to the aggregate effect of the environmental variables. Our study demonstrates that zooplankton functional community structure plays an important role in the regulation of a pivotal lake ecosystem function.

Herein, a series of lanthanide elements are used to prepare the lead free double perovskite Cs(2)NaLnX(6) (X = Cl, Br, I) nanocrystals (NCs), acting as both the main structural ions and the 4f-4f emission centers. The mechanisms for the broadband emission of Cs(2)NaLnX(6) NCs host are carefully studied based on various spectral results combining ultrafast dynamics detection and first-principles calculation. The broadband emission of the Cs(2)NaLnX(6) NCs originates from the self-trapped exciton. The Cs(2)NaLnX(6) NCs show remarkable water stability for more than eight months and favorable temperature and light irradiation stability (500 h). The PLQY for these materials is much higher than most of double perovskite materials, especially for Cs2NaEuCl6, which can approach to 70%. The white light emission from a single host material Cs2NaEuTbCl6 (Tb:Eu = 25:1) is obtained and applied to a light-emitting diode device, with a good CIE (Commission International de L'Eclairage) coordinate of (0.334, 0.326) and color rendering index of 91.2. Overall, the characteristics of lanthanide ions endow the super performance of Cs(2)NaLnX(6) NCs, which is obviously an important choice for future optoelectronic devices.

To capture the multiple unknown control directions, we design multiple Nussbaum-type gains for every subsystem. Based on this Nussbaum-type gain design, we construct a common Lyapunov function for all subsystems via backstepping technique, which can ensure the system stability under the existence of random switches. Meanwhile, the problem of multiple switching control gains is resolved by this means. To obviate repeated differentiation and decrease computation complexity, the dynamic surface control technique is introduced. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to validate the effectiveness of the developed method.

Herein, oxygen vacancies are localized only within MoO4 tetrahedrons rather than CoO6 octahedrons in CoMoO4 catalyst, guaranteeing coherent reconstruction of CoO6 octahedrons into pure CoOOH with tunable activities for OER. Meanwhile, distorted tetrahedron accelerates the dissolution of Mo atoms into alkaline electrolyte, triggering spontaneous transition of partial CoMoO4 into Co(OH)(2). CoO6 octahedrons in both CoMoO4 and Co(OH)(2) can transform pure CoOOH completely at lower potential, resulting in excess intrinsic activity whose summit is identified by overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) with 22.9% reduction and Tafel slope with 65.3% reduction. Well-defined manipulation over the distorted polyhedrons offers one versatile knob to precisely modulate electronic structure of oxide catalysts with outstanding OER performance.

However, extra point defects inevitably enlarge carrier scattering and deteriorate carrier mobility. Herein, it is found that the interstitial Cu in GeTe can result in synergistic effects, which include: 1) strengthened phonon scattering, leading to ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.48 W m(-1) K-1 at 623 K; 2) weakened carrier scattering, contributing to high carrier mobility of 80 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 300 K; 3) optimized carrier concentration of 1.22 x 10(20) cm(-3). Correspondingly, a high figure-of-merit of approximate to 2.3 at 623 K can be obtained in the Ge0.93Ti0.01Bi0.06Te-0.01Cu, which corresponds to a maximum energy conversion efficiency of approximate to 10% at a temperature difference of 423 K. This study systematically investigates the doping behavior of the interstitial Cu in GeTe-based thermoelectric materials for the first time and demonstrates that the localized interstitial Cu is a new strategy to enhance the thermoelectric performance of GeTe-based thermoelectric materials.

Particularly, the effects of Cr, Pd, Pt, Au, and Bi on monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer Bi2O2Se are explored. Naturally created Se vacancies on the Bi2O2Se surface are also considered by constructing two interface structures: the metal/Bi2O2Se with the Se vacancies remaining or filled with metals. For the metal/monolayer Bi2O2Se, it is observed that the Bi2O2Se layer is fully metallized since Bi2O2Se strongly interacts with the metal. Meanwhile, for the metal/bilayer and trilayer Bi2O2Se, the Bi2O2Se layers remain semiconducting except for the layer right next to metal. Among the considered metals, regardless of whether the Se vacancies are filled with metal or not, the semiconducting layers in bilayer and trilayer Bi2O2Se form Ohmic contact with Bi. It is also found that filling the Se vacancies with the metals heavier than Se increases the interface distance between metal and Bi2O2Se, and hence results in the weak Fermi level pinning effect.

As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non-covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long-lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2 times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10 days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long-lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission. Utilizing the efficient phosphorescence emission and excellent abominable-solvent resistance of this RTP material, multilevel information encryption has been successfully demonstrated. This work broadens the application scope of polymeric RTP materials in harsh environments and provides a new idea for achieving efficient RTP emission.

It is a better option to outsource these data to the cloud. When data is outsourced to the cloud, users lose control over it, compromising the data's integrity. Many public auditing schemes were proposed to address this issue, where trusted third-party auditors (TPAs) verify the integrity of data on behalf of the users. However, trusted TPAs are vulnerable and may not provide correct auditing results on time. Moreover, there is no trust nowadays. Blockchain-based auditing schemes were introduced to prevent trusted third parties from overcoming this issue. However, most blockchain-based public auditing schemes suffer from the key-escrow issue. To overcome the key-escrow problem and malicious auditors, in this article, a blockchain-based certificateless public auditing with privacy-preserving for cloud-based cyber-physical systems is constructed. The proposed scheme is secure against type I, II, III, and IV adversaries in the random oracle model. Further, the original proof of the data is masked using a random function to achieve data privacy when data is transferred between the cloud-server and verifier. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has higher efficiency and is suitable for cyber-physical systems.

Yet, this effect often remains unattained. Here, we test the hypothesis that transgressors' inferences about punisher motives crucially shape transgressors' post-punishment attitudes and behaviour. As such, we give primacy to the social and relational dimensions of punishment in explicating how sanctions affect outcomes. Across four studies using different methodologies (N = 1189), our findings suggest that (a) communicating punishment respectfully increases transgressor perceptions that the punisher is trying to repair the relationship between the transgressor and their group (relationship-oriented motive) and reduces perceptions of harm-oriented and self-serving motives, and that (b) attributing punishment to relationship-oriented (vs. harm/self-oriented, or even victim-oriented) motives increases prosocial attitudes and behaviour. This research consolidates and extends various theoretical perspectives on interactions in justice settings, providing suggestions for how best to deliver sanctions to transgressors.

This study aimed to improve the effects on the physical, textural, and rheological characteristics of cake supplied with Ziziphus jujuba fruit powder at rates of 0%, 3%, 5%, and 10%. The Physicochemical and antioxidant as well as the antibacterial activity and sensory qualities of Z. jujuba fruits were also investigated. The highest levels reached the values of 245.15 mg GAE/g DW (phenol) and 180.23 mg RE/g DW (flavonoids). Pulp extracts were also subjected to HPLC analysis in order to identify and quantify the sugar composition. This technique allowed us to identify Mahdia as the richest provenance especially in glucose (136.51%) and sucrose (113.28%) contents. The antioxidant activities investigated using DPPH assay decreased slightly from 175 mu g/mL (Sfax) to 55 mu g/mL (Mahdia). Furthermore, the antibacterial activity indicated that the S. aureus was the most inhibited especially by Sfax powder extracts (from 12 to 20 mm). Our results showed that the incorporation of Z. jujuba powder ameliorated the physicochemical and rheological characteristics (humidity, gluten yield, tenacity, falling time, and configuration) of the dough. Sensory analysis showed that consumer scores were increased with the increasing supplementation powder levels. Highest scores attributed to the cake supplied with 3% jujube powder collected from Mahdia provenance and confirmed that Ziziphus fruit could be advised a part of our diet. These results could validate a novel method to conserve Z. jujuba fruits in order to avoid their soilages for a long period.

Pore "Softening" and Emergence of Breathability Effects of New Keplerate Nano-Containers	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						Host-Guest Systems; Keplerate; Polyoxometalates; Selenium; Self-Assembly	OXIDE-BASED CAPSULE; BUILT-UP; METAL; CLUSTER; COMPLEXES; SURFACE	The self-assembly of porous molecular nanocapsules offer unique opportunities to investigate a range of interesting phenomena and applications. However, to design nanocapsules with pre-defined properties, thorough understanding of their structure-property relation is required. Here, we report the self-assembly of two elusive members of the Keplerate family, [Mo132Se60O312(H2O)(72)(AcO)(30)](42-) {Mo132Se60} 1 and [W72Mo60Se60O312(H2O)(72)(AcO)(30)](42-) {W72Mo60Se60} 2, that have been synthesised using pentagonal and dimeric ([Mo2O2Se2](2+)) building blocks and their structures have been confirmed via single crystal X-ray diffractions. Our comparative study involving the uptake of organic ions and the related ligand exchange of various ligand sizes by the {Mo132Se60} and previously reported Keplerates {Mo132O60}, {Mo132S60} based on the ligand exchange rates, revealed the emergence of increased "breathability" that dominates over the pore size as we transition from the {Mo132S60} to the "softer" {Mo132Se60} molecular nano-container.

Queensland Health wanted to better understand the drivers of screening to inform our planning and capitalise on self-collection as an option to reach under-screened women. In 2020 Queensland Health commissioned qualitative research to explore barriers and enablers to cervical screening with never-screened and under-screened women in Queensland (with under-screeners defined as having last screened more than 4 years ago and being more than 2 years overdue). Additionally, the research explored the acceptability of self-collection amongst this cohort.Methods: A mixed methods qualitative approach of online focus groups and in-depth interviews was employed. Online focus groups were conducted with under-screeners. In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with never-screeners due to the anticipated personal nature of their reasons for not screening.Results: A total of 51 Queensland women aged 30 to 50 years participated in the research.Conclusions: Queensland women cited several negative experiences and aspects of the current program, as well as barriers in their social and personal lives that limited screening intention and behaviour. Barriers and enablers to cervical screening identified in this research have been classified into four categories: structural, knowledge and attitudinal, social, and personal. The research identified more factors associated with nonparticipation than participation. However, the research did uncover a range of potential enablers to encourage screening, some of which related to the program design.So What?: The concept of self-collection was broadly well accepted by research participants, particularly by never-screeners. Recommendations resulting from this research include communications, systems, and eligibility changes, particularly regarding the availability and benefits of self-collection.

Longitudinal Patterns of Renal Function in Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis	ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH			English	Article							ANCA-ASSOCIATED VASCULITIS; GRANULOMATOSIS; DETERMINANTS; POLYANGIITIS; MORTALITY	Objective. A spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may occur in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). The longitudinal trajectory of renal function in AAV is poorly understood.Methods. Patients with & GE;2 creatinine measurements, including at baseline (+/- 30 days of treatment initiation), were included from the Mass General Brigham AAV Cohort. We calculated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We incorporated longitudinal changes in eGFR into a group-based trajectory model to identify patients with similar patterns of change in renal function. The chi-square test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to evaluate differences between groups in categorical variables and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively.Results. In 255 AAV patients, we identified 4 renal trajectory groups: rapid decline (n = 20), impaired (n = 82), preserved (n = 129), and recovery (n = 24). The rapid decline and impaired groups had greater baseline comorbidity (P = 0.01) and lower prevasculitis eGFR (P = 0.02). Clinically significant CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/minute/1.73 m(2)) persisted over 5 years in > 75% of the impaired group, compared to < 40% of patients in the preserved group (P < 0.001). ESRD occurred most frequently in the rapid decline (100%), followed by the impaired and preserved groups (7% each). Baseline AAV renal involvement was present prior to 95% of ESRD. However, ESRD etiology varied, with 90% of rapid-onset ESRD attributed to vasculitis, versus 17-44% in impaired or preserved groups (P = 0.001).Conclusion. We identified 4 longitudinal patterns of renal function after AAV diagnosis. Our findings highlight the burden of CKD in AAV and provide a framework for future research into personalized care in this vulnerable population.

Here, it is shown that nanofiber channel transistors with high electron mobility and operational stability can be achieved by selectively doping Zn element into electrospun In2O3 NFs. By precisely manipulating the doping level during NFs fabrication, their crystallinity, surface morphology, and corresponding device performance can be regulated reliably for enhanced transistor performances. It has been detected that InZnO/SiO2 TFTs with an optimized Zn doping concentration of 50% have demonstrated the high field-effect mobility (mu(FE)) of 6.38 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), the larger I-ON/I-OFF of 4.12 x 10(7) and operation in the energy-efficient enhancement-mode. Low frequency noise (LFN) measurements have displayed that the scattering and defects inside the NFs are effectively suppressed by the particular microstructure. When integrating ALD-derived Al2O3 films as the gate dielectric into TFTs devices, their electron mobility and I-ON/I-OFF can be further improved to 37.82 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and 2.92 x 10(8), respectively. To demonstrate the potential toward more complex logic applications, a low voltage resistor-loaded unipolar inverter is built by using InZnO/Al2O3 TFT, exhibiting a high gain of 20.95 and full swing characteristics. These optimized parameters have demonstrated the significant advance of this electrospinning technique toward practical applications for high performance and large-scale electronics.

Characteristics of recurrent acute urinary retention in BPH patients in the United States: Retrospective analysis of US-based insurance claims database	PROSTATE			English	Article						acute urinary retention (AUR); benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); BPH surgery; catheterization	BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA; TRACT SYMPTOMS; TRANSURETHRAL RESECTION; RISK; DISPARITIES; POPULATION; MEN	PurposeThe objective of this study is to analyze characteristics of recurrent acute urinary retention (AUR) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), utilizing a population based data set. Also, we sought to report on how AUR was treated, specifically regarding the need and length of catheterization and types of procedures utilized for mitigation. Materials & MethodsA retrospective observational cohort study was performed using Optum's deidentified Clinformatics (R) Data Mart Database. We compared two groups, BPH patients with AUR (n = 180,737) and BPH patients without AUR (n = 1,139,760) from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2017. Also, we analyzed the factors affecting the development of multiple episodes of AUR through age-adjusted multivariate analysis. ResultsIn contrast to the 47.7% of patients who had a single AUR episode, 33.5% of AUR patients developed 3 or more subsequent episodes of retention. For age matched patients, the risks of additional episodes of retention increase significantly with older age, Caucasian race, diabetes, neurologic conditions, or low income. Overall, the rate of BPH surgery in AUR patients over the study period decreased and the most common procedure was transurethral resection of the prostate. ConclusionsRisk factors for multiple episodes of AUR included age (60 and older), Caucasian race, lower income socioeconomic status, diabetes, and neurological disorders. Patients with a high probability of developing recurrent episodes of AUR are recommended to receive preemptive BPH medication before such AUR occurrences. Also, more expeditious surgical treatment should be considered rather than temporary catheterization when AUR occurs.

These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: 1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. 2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non-spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e-skins, and wearables. The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.

In both cases, its expression has been associated with environmental stress, and its practical use as a diacritical feature has been previously evaluated. In this study, we undertook further evaluation of the phylogeny of Umezakia natans and its relationship to Chrysosporum ovalisporum as a previous study suggested the two were potentially congeneric. We used combined morphological, phylogenetic, and phylogenomic approaches to determine their relatedness using new strains available from a broad geographic range. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that Australian C. ovalisporum and Japanese U. natans strains clustered together with accessions of C. ovalisporum originating from Australia, Israel, and Spain, with high p-distance similarity values (99.5%-99.9%). Additionally, differences between the two species in the 16S-23S ITS region was low (0%-2.5%). The average nucleotide identity of the U. natans and C. ovalisporum strains was also high (ANI of > 99.5 and AF > 0.9) and supported a genus-level separation from Chrysosporum bergii (83 ANI between clusters). Furthermore, in culture, strains of both species grown in vitamin-free media showed facultative true branching, a feature not previously known in C. ovalisporum. Collectively, the results support unification of C. ovalisporum and U. natans according to the principle of priority as Umezakia ovalisporum.

Outcomes on an inpatient oncology service after the introduction of hospitalist comanagement	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							CHEMOTHERAPY; ASSOCIATION; TRANSITION; PATIENT; SAFETY; LENGTH; CARE	BackgroundSmilow Cancer Hospital (SCH) introduced hospitalist comanagement to the inpatient oncology service to address long lengths of stay and oncologist burnout. ObjectiveTo determine the impact of hospitalists on inpatient quality outcomes and oncologist experience. InterventionsHospitalists were introduced to one of two inpatient oncology services at SCH. Patients were assigned to teams equally based on capacity. Outcomes on the oncologist-led, traditional service (TS) were compared with outcomes on the hospitalist service (HS) 6 months after program implementation. Main Outcomes and MeasuresOutcomes included patient volume, length of stay (LOS), early discharge, discharge time, and 30-day readmission rate. Mixed linear or Poisson models that accounted for multiple admissions during the study duration were used. Oncologist experience was measured by survey. ResultsDuring the study period, there were 713 discharges, 400 from the HS and 313 from the TS (p = .0003). There was no difference in demographics or severity of illness (SOI) between services. Following adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, cancer type, and discharge disposition, the average LOS was 4.71 on the HS and 5.47 on the TS (p = .01). Adjusted early discharge rate was 6.22% on the HS and 2.06% on the TS (p = .01). Adjusted mean discharge time was 3:45 p.m. on HS and 4:16 p.m. on TS (p = .009). There was no difference in readmission rates. Oncologists reported less stress (p = .001) and a better ability to manage competing responsibilities (p < .0001) while working on the HS. ConclusionsHospitalist comanagement significantly improved LOS, early discharge, time of discharge, and oncologist experience without an increase in 30-day readmissions.

The primary end-point was the change in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version from baseline to week 24, with the aim of evaluating the non-inferiority of the done-pezil patch 27.5 mg compared with donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg.Results: Of 340 randomized patients, 303 completed the double-blind period. Changes from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive component-Japanese version at week 24 (least squares mean + standard error) were-0.7 + 0.4 (donepezil patch 27.5 mg) and 0.2 + 0.4 (donepezil hydrochloride tablet 5 mg). The difference in the least squares means (95% confidence interval) was-0.9 (-2.01 to 0.14). The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference between groups was less than the predefined non-inferiority margin of 2.15. The donepezil patches 27.5 mg also had a safety profile that showed good tolerability comparable with donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg. Conclusions: Non-inferiority on suppression of cognitive decline was shown for the done-pezil patch 27.5 mg when compared with donepezil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.

Nevertheless, there has been limited success in breeding for SPW resistance globally. This is attributed partly to difficulty in screening for resistance because resistance to the SPW is complex and is mediated by several resistance indicators. Measuring all these resistance indicators is costly and time consuming. To enhance efficiency in selection for SPW resistance, there is need to profile and identify key resistance indicators. Potentially, this will better enable breeders to timely and precisely select for SPW resistance. The objective of this study was to identify the most efficient morphological resistance indicators against SPW. Thirty sweetpotato genotypes that varied in resistance to SPW comprising local collections, released varieties, and breeding lines were evaluated at three locations for two seasons in Uganda using an alpha lattice design. Data were collected on storage root yield, SPW root and stem damage, and weevil resistance indicators such as vine vigor (VV), ground cover (GC), vine weight (VW), storage root neck length (NL), latex content, cortex thickness (CT), and dry matter content (DM). Genotype means for all measured traits varied significantly except for CT. Negative relationships were observed between SPW root damage and GC, VW, CT, VV, NL, and DM. However, path coefficient analysis showed storage root NL (direct effect of -0.43, p < 0.001) as the most important morphological resistance indicator. Therefore, NL could be the most reliable predictor of resistance to SPW among breeding clones, especially at early breeding stages.

MethodsThis was a single-arm study with 27 children and adolescents undergoing antineoplastic treatments. Patients were followed up for 10 weeks, and their oral health conditions were evaluated using the Modified Gingival Index (MGI), Visible Plaque Index (VPI), and the modified Oral Assessment Guide (OAG). Audiovisual resources, storytelling, and ludic instruments were used to provide oral health education to patients and parents/caregivers. ResultsThe patients' mean age was 9.41 (+/- 4.49) years, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most prevalent diagnosis (22.2%). Mean MGI and VPI values were 0.82 (+/- 0.59) and 54.11% (+/- 19.92%) at baseline and 0.33 (+/- 0.29) and 19.83% (+/- 11.47%) after 10 weeks, respectively (p < .05). The mean OAG score was 9.51 (+/- 2.54) and 36 cases (19.8%) of severe oral mucositis (SOM) were documented. Patients with higher MGI were more likely to develop SOM. ConclusionThe OHEPP had a positive impact on pediatric patients undergoing cancer therapy by improving their periodontal health, reducing biofilm accumulation, and preventing the development of OM lesions.

DesignSystematic review with meta-analysis. Data SourcesSearchers were conducted in October 2020 and updated in August 2022 in the databases CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase (R), ERIC, LILACS, MEDLINE, PsycINFO (R), Scopus and Web of Science, PQDT Open (ProQuest), BDTD, Google Scholar and specific journals on simulation. Review MethodsThis review was conducted according to the recommendations of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and reported according to the PRISMA Statement. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies that compared the effect of simulation on stress, anxiety and self-confidence of nursing students were included. The selection of studies and data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Simulation information was collected as prebriefing, scenario, debriefing, duration, modality, fidelity and simulator. Data summarization was performed by qualitative synthesis and meta-analytical methods. ResultsEighty studies were included in the review, and most reported in detail the structure of the simulation, contemplating prebriefing, scenario, debriefing and the duration of each step. In subgroup meta-analysis, the presence of prebriefing, duration of more than 60 min and high-fidelity simulations helped reduce anxiety, while the presence of prebriefing and debriefing, duration, immersive clinical simulation modalities and procedure simulation, high-fidelity simulations and use of mannequins, standardised patients and virtual simulators, contributed to greater students' self-confidence. ConclusionsDifferent modulations of simulation design components imply reduction of anxiety and increased self-confidence in nursing students, especially highlighting the quality of the methodological report of simulation interventions. Relevance to Clinical PracticeThese findings help to support the need of more rigorous methodology in simulation designs and research methods. Consequently, impact on the education of qualified professionals prepared to work in clinical practice.No Patient or Public Contribution.

The preferential binding of H3V(CTG) at the biofilm gene promoters makes chromatin repressive for the biofilm mode of growth. The two evolutionarily conserved chaperone complexes involved in incorporating histone H3 are CAF-1 and HIRA. In this study, we sought to identify the chaperone complex(es) involved in loading H3V(CTG). We demonstrate that C. albicans cells lacking either Cac1 or Cac2 subunit of the CAF-1 chaperone complex, exhibit a hyper-filamentation phenotype on solid surfaces and form more robust biofilms than wild-type cells, thereby mimicking the phenotype of the H3V(CTG) null mutant. None of the subunits of the HIRA chaperone complex shows any significant difference in biofilm growth as compared to the wild type. The occupancy of H3V(CTG) is found to be significantly reduced at the promoters of biofilm genes in the absence of CAF-1 subunits. Hence, we provide evidence that CAF-1, a chaperone known to load canonical histone H3 in mammalian cells, is involved in chaperoning of variant histone H3V(CTG) at the biofilm gene promoters in C. albicans. Our findings also illustrate the acquisition of an unconventional role of the CAF-1 chaperone complex in morphogenesis in C. albicans.

F.; Goldman, Mindy			Use of selective phenotyping and genotyping to identify rare blood donors in Canada	VOX SANGUINIS			English	Article; Early Access						blood donors; donor race and ethnicity; genotyping		Background and ObjectivesThe distribution of rare and specific red cell phenotypes varies between races and ethnicities. Therefore, the most compatible red cell units for patients with haemoglobinopathies and other rare blood requirements are most likely to be found in donors from similar genetic backgrounds. Our blood service introduced a voluntary question asking donors to provide their racial background/ethnicity. Results triggered additional phenotyping and/or genotyping. Materials and MethodsWe analysed the results of additional testing performed between January 2021 and June 2022, and rare donors were added to the Rare Blood Donor database. We determined the incidence of various rare phenotypes and blood group alleles based on donor race/ethnicity. ResultsOver 95% of donors answered the voluntary question; 715 samples were tested, and 25 donors were added to the Rare Blood Donor database, including five k-, four U-, two Jk(a-b-) and two D- - phenotypes. ConclusionAsking donors about their race/ethnicity was well received by donors, and the resulting selective testing enabled us to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of being rare blood donors, support patients with rare blood requirements and better understand the incidence of common and rare alleles and red blood cell phenotypes in the Canadian donor population.

Our aim was to microencapsulate ASX through ionic gelation to improve its stability and bioaccessibility, evaluating the performance of low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) and chitosan, besides the most common alginate. Three formulations were tested: 3% pectin (Pec), 3% pectin + chitosan shell (PecChi) and 1.5% alginate-1.5% LMP + chitosan shell. The results showed that chitosan deposited onto PecAlChi and PecChi beads improved particle sphericity and limited oil oxidation during processing. PecAlChi provided the highest encapsulation efficiency (87%) and bioaccessibility (58%). The stability test at 65 degrees C x 24 days showed different polymer-dependent degradation kinetics, with PecChi providing the highest stability (48%). In conclusion, encapsulation performance strongly depended on the chitosan shell and the gelling polymers. This suggests that tuning the alginate/pectin ratio may lead to the best compromise between stability and bioaccessibility.

Furthermore, single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer from the electroluminescent center to different accepters is achieved through rational molecular engineering, enabling construction of a multicolor SM-LED. All these characterizations are accomplished in the photoelectrical integration system with high temporal/spatial/energy resolution, demonstrating the capability of the single-photon emission of SM-LEDs. The success in developing high-performance SM-LEDs inspires the development of the next generation of commercial display devices and promises a single-photon emitter for use in quantum computation and quantum communication.

Despite the significant progress made in previous works, there are still research gaps in the study of customer complaint handling and customers' post-behavior. Therefore, this study introduced the important variable "swift-guanxi " (SG) to explore the relationship between complaint handling and the sustained participation of customers. Data were collected through both online and offline methods. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to test the relevant hypotheses. The results from assessing these data indicate that the factors of conversational human voice (CHV), reply length (RL) and perceived justice (PJ) all exert a significant influence on SG, which in turn affects the sustained participation behavior (SPB) of customers. In addition, complaint publicization (CP) has a negative impact on this behavior.

This work studies the hydrothermal synthesis and the excitonic effects in the linear and nonlinear optical properties of 1T ' phase ReS2. The growth is controlled by adjusting experimental conditions, and its growth mechanism is revealed. The varying degrees of Re vacancy are characterized. They cause the growth direction of ReS2 nanosheets from lateral to agglomeration and the stacks into self-assembly micro-nanospheres. The density functional theory explains the electronic and bonding properties of Re vacancy, where the existent defects reduce the band gap and change the states density. Re vacancy increases the conductivity and results in the metallization of ReS2. The photoluminescence intensity of defect emission peak is negatively correlated with the defect level for the enriching vacancies. However, compared with intrinsic peak, it will increase monotonically with the number of bound excitons in defects. Furthermore, the nonlinear absorption properties are obtained by picosecond Z-scan technique. By adjusting temperature, different degrees of saturation absorption and reverse saturation absorption characteristics appear due to the vacancy effect. The synthesized ReS2 has broad application in photodetectors and optical devices with optical amplitude limiting.

However, Na+ diffusion within GMSs anodes leads to severe volume change, generally representing a fundamental limitation to rate capability and cycling stability. Here, monodispersed In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon hollow microspindles (In6S7/NSC HMS) are produced by morphology-preserved thermal sulfurization of spindle-like and porous indium-based metal organic frameworks. The resulting In6S7/NSC HMS anode exhibits theoretical-value-close specific capacity (546.2 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1)), ultrahigh rate capability (267.5 mAh g(-1) at 30.0 A g(-1)), high initial coulombic efficiency (approximate to 93.5%), and approximate to 92.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This kinetically favored In6S7/NSC HMS anode fills up the kinetics gap with a capacitive porous carbon cathode, enabling a sodium-ion capacitor to deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 136.3 Wh kg(-1) and a maximum power density of 47.5 kW kg(-1). The in situ/ex situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculation both show that the robust and fast Na+ charge storage of In6S7/NSC HMS arises from the multi-electron redox mechanism, buffered volume expansion, negligible morphological change, and surface-controlled solid-state Na+ transport.

AimsWe aimed to characterise people who act together when committing a serious crime and to map the frequency of such crimes over 21 years in Finland. MethodsData for the study were retrieved from the national database of forensic psychiatric examinations for the period 2000-2020, with reports on file for nearly all people charged with serious criminal offences in the country. Index cases were defined as those with two or more perpetrators attacking a single victim; people who acted alone were comparison cases. Sex and age at the time of the crime were extracted together with all diagnoses listed in the reports. ResultsSeventy-five multiple perpetrator groups (MPG) were identified, accounting for 165 individuals whose reports were compared with 2494 single-perpetrator (SPR) reports. Most group and solitary offenders were male (87%: 86%, respectively). The index offence was more likely to be homicide among the group perpetrators (mean 1.12) than the solitary offenders (mean 0.83). Proportionately more of the group offenders had personality disorder or substance use disorders (antisocial personality disorder MPG 49%: SPR 32%; any personality disorder MPG 89%: SPR 76%); alcohol (MPG 79%: SPR 69%; cannabis MPG 15%: SPR 9%). By contrast, psychosis was about twice as common among the solitary offenders (MPG 12%; SPR 26%). ConclusionsThe number of group-perpetrated crimes has not increased, according to these Finnish forensic psychiatric report data of 2000-2020, but the relatively high prevalence among them of personality and substance use disorders is a constant. Understanding psychiatric disorders as factors in both leading to and avoiding violent conflicts may help plan new approaches to further diminish group violence.

The random raw bits are fed back to produce control voltages, which control the transmission gates in ring oscillators. Since random fluctuations of the control voltages increase the phase jitter of the oscillator, this architecture improves the bit rate and randomness of random sequence. Besides, a post-processor is designed to enhance the randomness further. The circuit is implemented in TSMC 40-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, and it takes up an area of 85 x 51 mu m. Measurement results show that the random number sequences pass the statistical randomness tests, with a low power consumption of 67 mu W, high speed of 45 Mbps, and low energy efficiency of 1.48 pJ/bit.

To date, over 100 high-resolution structures have been reported for peptoids, which are typically defined as N-substituted glycine oligomers. We have collected these structures and standardized their sequence representations to facilitate structural analysis as the dataset continues to grow. These structures are presented online as The Peptoid Data Bank (), which also provides persistent links to the published structural data. This review analyzes the present collection of structures and finds extensive support for grouping side chains by their chemistry at the position adjacent to the backbone nitrogen. Groups of side chains with similar chemistry at this position show similar influences on the conformational preferences of the backbone. We also observe a relationship between the side chain and backbone conformations for many monomers that has not previously attracted significant discussion: the values of the chi(1) and phi dihedrals are correlated. We outline a general design strategy for attaining a specific backbone conformation based on the patterns seen in the collected structures.	[Eastwood, James R.

Novel <i>ANKRD26</i> and <i>PDGFRB</i> gene mutations in pediatric case of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis: Case report and literature review	JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY			English	Review						ANKRD26 mutation; histiocytosis; JXG; non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis; PDGFR mutation; PDGFR-CD74 fusion; pediatric		Cutaneous non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis (NLCH) is a rare and biologically benign entity that can be broadly classified into two categories: xanthogranuloma and non-xanthogranuloma. The xanthogranuloma family is characterized by a proliferation of histiocytes with both macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation, negative BRAF mutation, and rare Touton-type giant cells. Molecular studies have reported that mutations involved in the MAPK signaling pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of histiocytoses. While LCH is associated with the somatic mutation of BRAF v600e, however, mutations and gene fusions in NLCH cases are undefined. We hereby present a 19-month-old female with recalcitrant nodular rashes diagnosed as NLCH with associated novel genetic mutation involving ANKRD26 and PDGFRB genes, as well as PDGFRB::CD74 fusion mRNA. Immunohistochemical staining showed strong and diffuse CD68 and CD163 positivity, and negative CD1a, CD207, ALK D5F3, S100 protein, and BRAF V600E (VE1). Albeit unknown significance, this case of an ANKRD26 and PDGFRB gene mutation in cutaneous NLCH has not been reported prior in the literature. Our case highlights the advantage of pathology and genetic studies in cutaneous NLCH to increase the understanding of this heterogeneous enigmatic disorder and identify further options in management.

MethodsPubmed/MEDLINE database was searched using research question (capno* OR etCO2 OR detCO2 OR (['end tidal' OR 'end-tidal'] AND [CO2 OR 'carbon dioxide']) AND (neonat* OR infant* OR newborn*) AND transport*). All articles relevant to the topic were reviewed and summarised. ResultsThe lack of studies relevant to neonatal transport prompted us to extend the search to capnometry in a neonatal intensive care setting. The published studies are showing conflicting results. The different study populations, technologies used to measure etCO(2), types of etCO(2) sampling and the diverse sites of blood gas tests make the data unsuitable for systematic comparison. ConclusionFurther research to obtain more data on capnometry during neonatal transport will be necessary to define precisely under what circumstances can end-tidal monitoring of CO2 be reliably used in neonates during transport and also how to interpret the measured values.

MethodsA total of 800 image patches consisting of 400 patches of low- and high-risk groups, each verified by computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam CT for dental use, were cropped from downloaded panoramic images and input into a DL system. Seven hundred of these patches (350 high-risk and 350 low-risk group patches) were randomly assigned to the training and validation datasets, and 100 (50 high-risk and 50 low-risk group patches) were assigned to the test datasets. Using data augmentation for the training datasets, the training process was carried out twice. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the performance of two kinds of observers (residents and radiologists) with the same test images. The interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined to evaluate the diagnostic consistency. ResultsThe area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of the DL model, residents, and radiologists were 0.85, 0.55, and 0.81, respectively. Significant differences were observed between the DL model and residents, and between the residents and radiologists. The ICCs of the DL model, residents, and radiologists were 0.69, 0.19, and 0.54, respectively. ConclusionsThe DL model has potential for use in diagnostic support in the evaluation of the three-dimensional contact status between the mandibular third molar and canal on panoramic images.

From August 2021 to September 2022, 36 patients aged >= 15 years with moderate to severe AD were treated with oral baricitinib 4 mg/day plus topical corticosteroids. Baricitinib improved clinical indexes; the percent reduction at weeks 4 and 12 was a median of 69.19% and 69.98% for the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), 84.52% and 76.33% for the Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool, and 76.39% and 64.58% for Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Score, respectively. The achievement rate of EASI 75 was 38.89% and 33.33% at weeks 4 and 12, respectively. The percent reduction of EASI in the head and neck, upper limbs, lower limbs, and trunk was 56.9%, 68.3%, 80.7%, and 62.5% at week 12, respectively, with a significant difference between the head and neck versus the lower limbs. Baricitinib decreased thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, lactate dehydrogenase, and total eosinophil count at week 4. Baseline EASI of the head and neck negatively correlated with percent reduction of EASI at week 4, while baseline EASI of the lower limbs positively correlated with percent reduction of EASI at week 12. Treatment-emergent adverse events included elevation of creatine phosphokinase (11.1%), herpes labialis (5.6%), furuncle (8.3%), and exacerbation of AD (1%), without serious treatment-emergent adverse events. In this real-world study, baricitinib was well tolerated for patients with AD and achieved therapeutic effects comparable to those in clinical trials. High baseline EASI of the lower limbs might predict good treatment response at week 12, while high baseline EASI of the head and neck might predict poor treatment response at week 4 in baricitinib treatment for AD.

Here, we analyse aerial treatment data collected from two ant-eradication programmes, quantifying how the relationships between flight time and area are influenced by numerous aircraft/delivery system/bait/flight speed combinations. RESULTSFor bait dispersal by helicopters, and when swath widths are equivalent, side-mounted Isolair was significantly more efficient than the simultaneous use of two underslung buckets, and use of two buckets was slightly but not significantly more efficient than one bucket. In this scenario, delivery by Isolair was, on average, 39.8% and 31.5% more efficient than the use of one or two buckets, respectively. However, when the swath width used with Isolair was halved to 10 m and flight speed was increased slightly, flight time was significantly greater compared to the other configurations. For bait dispersed by drone, flights conducted using an upgraded Flight Management System (FMS) and greater flight speed but smaller swath width were significantly more efficient than flights using the older FMS and lower flight speed. Over 10 and 50 ha the helicopter was 2.87 and 4.82 times more time efficient than the drone. CONCLUSIONWe encourage practitioners to publish data from their aerial treatments, and to try new methods, to accelerate improvements in efficiency and reduce the costs of aerial treatments.

Optical coherence tomography for presurgical delineation of basal cell carcinomas on the face-A comparison with histopathology	JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY			English	Article						basal cell carcinoma; dermatologic oncology; non-invasive imaging; optical coherence tomography; tumor delineation	MICROGRAPHIC SURGERY	Background: To minimize the risk of incomplete excision of basal cell carcinomas (BCC) the macroscopic tumor margins should be adequately defined. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging tool that can provide structural and vascular information about skin cancer lesions. The study objective was to compare the presurgical delineation of facial BCC by clinical examination, histopathology, and OCT imaging in tumors undergoing full excision.Methods: Ten patients with BCC lesions on the face were examined clinically, with OCT and histopathology at 3-mm intervals, from the clinical lesion border and beyond the resection line. The OCT scans were evaluated blinded and a delineation estimate of each BCC lesion was made. The results were compared to the clinical and histopathologic results.Results: OCT evaluations and histopathology were in agreement in 86.6% of the collected data points. In three cases the OCT scans estimated a reduction of the tumor size compared to the clinical tumor border set by the surgeon.Conclusion: The results of this study support the notion that OCT can have a role in the clinical daily practice by aiding clinicians in delineating BCC lesions before surgery.

To make sleep analysis more available both in research and in the clinic, there is a need for a reliable wearable device for sleep staging. In this case study, we test ear-electroencephalography. A wearable, where electrodes are placed in the outer ear, as a platform for longitudinal at-home recording of sleep. We explore the usability of the ear-electroencephalography in a shift work case with alternating sleep conditions. We find the ear-electroencephalography platform to be reliable both in terms of showing substantial agreement to polysomnography after long-time use (with an overall agreement, using Cohen's kappa, of 0.72) and by being unobtrusive enough to wear during night shift conditions. We find that fractions of non-rapid eye movement sleep and transition probability between sleep stages show great potential as sleep metrics when exploring quantitative differences in sleep architecture between shifting sleep conditions. This study shows that the ear-electroencephalography platform holds great potential as a reliable wearable for quantifying sleep "in the wild", pushing this technology further towards clinical adaptation.

Here we report the design of enzyme-operated spherical nucleic acids (E-SNAs) for manipulation of the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of proteins with cancer-cell selectivity. The E-SNAs are constructed by programmable engineering of aptamer-based modules bearing enzyme-responsive units in predesigned sites and further combination with SNA nanotechnology. We demonstrate that E-SNAs are able to regulate cytoplasmic-to-nuclear shuttling of RelA protein efficiently and specifically in tumor cells, while they remain inactive in normal cells due to insufficient enzyme expression. We further confirmed the generality of this strategy by investigating the enzyme-modulated inhibition/activation of thrombin activity by varying the aptamer-based design.

The intervention was designed for breast cancer patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels of psychological symptoms. MethodsPatients were randomly assigned to the immediate intervention arm (n = 61; intervention received immediately) or to the delayed intervention arm (n = 59; intervention received 5 months later). Psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, emotional distress, fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), worry, and intrusive thoughts were assessed through questionnaires. Emotion regulation was assessed in a dynamic emotion regulation task and in everyday life. Assessments were completed at baseline (T1), 5 months (T2) and 10 months (T3) later. ResultsTreated patients reported lower levels of worry and intrusive thoughts. They improved their ability to down-regulate the intensity of their negative emotions when exposed to cancer-related triggers in the dynamic emotion regulation task. They reported fewer and less intense negative emotions and more positive emotions in their everyday life. Benefits were maintained 5 months later, except for positive emotions in everyday life. ConclusionsThe results showed that focusing on emotion regulation is a relevant approach in the treatment of psychological symptoms for breast cancer patients in the early survivorship period meeting criteria for clinical levels of psychological symptoms. The intervention led to changes in patients' dynamic and everyday life emotion regulation. Consolidation sessions may be needed to sustain benefits in positive emotions and to increase the effect sizes.

J	Simanjuntak, JM; Heriyanto; Hasibuan, N				Simanjuntak, Junihot M.; Heriyanto; Hasibuan, Nelson			Continuous assessment of Peter Senge's learning organization model for improving the quality of Christian higher education in Indonesia	TEACHING THEOLOGY AND RELIGION			English	Article						assessment; learning organization model; quality improvement	DESIGN	This paper briefly discusses Peter Senge's Continuous Assessment Learning Organization Model for Quality Improvement, and describes how it is implemented in improving the quality of education by Christian Religious Colleges in Indonesia. The main conclusion of this paper is that Christian Religious Colleges in Indonesia must develop an organizational culture where continuous assessment for quality improvement is part of everyday practice in schools. To achieve this, it is proposed that schools should become learning communities based on Peter Senge's Learning Organization model. While this paper is not based on research, the main implication is that every school should seek creative ways to implement Peter Senge's Continuous Assessment Learning Organization Model for Quality Improvement according to its culture and spirituality. A second implication is a Christian learning organization should be a prayer-defined organization. Every activity, every decision should be informed by prayer and be done in prayer, seeking the will of God, his approval, and his glory. Prayer should play a key role in any assessment. This conceptual paper is original as it explores the fit of applying Peter Senge's Continuous Assessment Learning Organization Model with seeking the will of God, his approval, and his glory for quality improvement in Christian Religious Colleges in Indonesia.

We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of hBMSC transdifferentiation into liver and immune cells. MethodsA single type of hBMSCs was transplanted into immunodeficient Fah-/- Rag2-/- IL-2R gamma c-/- SCID (FRGS) mice with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Liver transcriptional data from the hBMSC-transplanted mice were analysed to identify transdifferentiation with traces of liver and immune chimerism. ResultsMice with FHF were rescued by implanted hBMSCs. Human albumin/leukocyte antigen (HLA) and CD45/HLA double-positive hepatocytes and immune cells were observed in the rescued mice during the initial 3 days. The transcriptomics analysis of liver tissues from dual-humanized mice identified two transdifferentiation phases (cellular proliferation at 1-5 days and cellular differentiation/maturation at 5-14 days) and ten cell lineages transdifferentiated from hBMSCs: human hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, stellate cells, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune cells (T/B/NK/NKT/Kupffer cells). Two biological processes, hepatic metabolism and liver regeneration, were characterized in the first phase, and two additional biological processes, immune cell growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation, were observed in the second phase. Immunohistochemistry verified that the ten hBMSC-derived liver and immune cells were present in the livers of dual-humanized mice. ConclusionsA syngeneic liver-immune dual-humanized mouse model was developed by transplanting a single type of hBMSC. Four biological processes linked to the transdifferentiation and biological functions of ten human liver and immune cell lineages were identified, which may help to elucidate the molecular basis of this dual-humanized mouse model for further clarifying disease pathogenesis.

Yet, the atroposelective synthesis of these molecules remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to recent methods using more advanced chiral catalysts, a very simply accessed Jacobsen-type chromium(III)-salen complex was used here as a chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Mild reaction conditions afforded various 5-hydroxybenzo[g]indoles in up to 97 % yield. Moreover, through a simple work-up, very high enantiomeric excesses of up to 99 % could be obtained.

To inform PA support for people with RA the aim was to determine whether the broader RA population share similar beliefs and strategies regarding PA to those who report successful engagement.Methods A modified two-stage Delphi approach. 200 patients from four National Health Service rheumatology departments received a postal questionnaire containing statements relating to engagement with PA derived from prior interview data from physically active individuals with RA. Statements rated as agree or strongly agree by > 50% of respondents were retained and the same respondents asked to rate and prioritize potential PA intervention components.Ethical approval: Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (ref 13/SC/0418).Results Questionnaire one received 49 responses (11 males, 37 females, 1 unknown), mean age 65 years (range 29-82). Low levels of PA were reported by 60% of respondents. Questionnaire two responses (n = 36) indicated that a PA intervention should include information about prevention of RA symptoms worsening and benefits of PA for joints; help participants to achieve improved pain management and a feeling of being in control of their RA. For PA maintenance it was important that medication controlled symptoms, and PA instructors understood RA to ensure safety.Conclusions A key factor to consider when designing a PA intervention for people with RA is that education from a knowledgeable instructor should underpin programme delivery alongside effective medication. Programmes may need tailoring based on demographics; this should be explored in future studies.

In this work, the redox state of the PVDF-b-PTFE (PVT) solid polymer electrolyte is regulated by introducing fully conjugated copper polyphthalocyanine metal (CuPcLi), improving the electron transfer kinetics to accelerate the decomposition of fluorinated ingredients. As a result, an effective SEI with enriched lithium fluoride forms in situ at the Li/electrolyte interface, which enhances the Li-ion transport kinetics and regulates the lithium deposition behavior, delivering ultra-stable lithium plating/stripping performance over 2000 h in the Li//Li half-cell. In addition, the chemisorption between Cu2+ and O atoms from TFSI- restrains the movement of anions in the electrolyte, and the CuPcLi improves the lithium ion release, exhibiting a high lithium-ion conductivity of 0.8 mS cm(-1) and a high lithium-ion transference number of 0.74. As a result, the solid polymer electrolyte of PVT-10CuPcLi paired with LiFePO4 delivers fantastic cyclic performance with a capacity retention of 92% even after 1000 cycles at 1 C at room temperature. When paired with high-voltage LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, the cells can be operated at 1 C with superior capacity retention over 88% after 300 cycles.

However, salt scaling on and inside the evaporator structure induced by insufficient ion distribution control will lower the evaporation performance and hinder the stability and durability of evaporators. Herein, inspired by the highly efficient salt-expelling property of the gill filaments of large yellow croaker, a bionic-gill 3D hydrogel evaporator is proposed with fabulous multidirectional ion migration controllability. A 3D structure composed of arrayed beaded hollow columns with beaded hollow holes inspired by gill filaments ensuring longitudinal ion backflow and the peristome-mimetic arrayed grooves of microcavities ensuring lateral ion advection is designed and constructed to achieve fabulous multidirectional crossflow salt ion migration, which ensures high evaporation performance for pure water (an evaporation rate of 2.53 kg m(-2) h(-1) with an energy efficiency of 99.3%) as well as for high salinity brine (2.11 kg m(-2) h(-1) for 25.0 wt.% NaCl solution), with no salt crystallizing after long-term use. Furthermore, the 3D hydrogel evaporator has excellent chemical stability, mechanical properties, folding-irrelevant evaporation performance, and portability so that it can be used for the preliminary desalination of breeding wastewater through the proposed self-circulation koi aquaculture system.

Herein, a large negative magnetoresistance (MR) in all-2D-materials-based vertical magnetic spin valves with nano/micro bubbles existing at the interface between the spacer layer (MoS2) and the top ferromagnetic electrode layer (Cr0.85Te or Fe3GeTe2) is demonstrated. The large negative MR, with a magnitude of approximate to 21.5% attained in Cr0.85Te/MoS2/Fe3GeTe2, could be fully suppressed by the elimination of the bubbles after a short argon-protected annealing, indicating the determining role of the bubbles in modulating the spin-related transport behavior. First-principles calculations based on density function theory (DFT) illustrate that the compressive strain can significantly modify the spin-resolved electronic band structures of the 2D ferromagnetic materials, and hence alter the spin polarization near the Fermi level, accounting for the negative MR phenomena with the conventional two-current model. Herein, a new route to all-2D-materials-based spintronic devices via strain engineering is provided, and also offers a new insight into the role of bubbles formed during fabricating 2D heterostructures in developing exotic properties and novel functionalities.

In the absence of specific radiological and immunological markers, the differential diagnosis between these two diseases can be challenging. We aimed to determine whether hands ultrasonography (US) may be useful in the differential diagnosis between PsA and RA.Methods - We conducted a cross-sectional study including patients with PsA and RA. All wrists and small joints of the hands were examined using gray-scale and Power Doppler US. The evaluated US lesions were: synovitis, tenosynovitis of extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor communis and flexor tendons, enthesitis of extensor tendons at distal interphalangeal joints, peritendon inflammation of extensor tendons, and soft tissue edema.Results - Six hundred joints in 20 PsA patients and 900 joints in 30 RA patients were assessed. Extensor enthesitis was significantly more observed in PsA compared with RA (39.4 vs 26.3%, P = .006) with a significant higher frequency of enthesophytes and calcifications (P = .022 and P = .002, respectively). Peritendon inflammation of extensor digitorum tendons was observed in 13% of metacarpophalangeal joints in PsA patients versus 3% in RA patients with a significant difference (P < .001). Soft tissue edema was exclusively observed in PsA (1.5 vs 0%, P = .033). Power Doppler synovitis was significantly more frequent in RA (9.2 vs 5%, P = .002). Extensor carpi ulnaris tenosynovitis was significantly more frequent in RA (18.3 vs 2.5%, P = .017).Conclusion -Extrasynovial US findings may be helpful to distinguish PsA from RA especially in patients with immunonegative polyarthritis and no evidence of psoriasis.

Nevertheless, there are limited studies that have systematically reviewed the literature on the relationship between electricity consumption and NTL. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a systematic review of studies that have explored this relationship. The review identified over 200 regression models estimating electricity consumption using NTL satellite images. The key finding of the review was that there was a large variability in regression performance for model prediction of electricity consumption from NTL imagery, indicating a need for further work to refine the techniques and approaches in this emerging field of remote sensing research. The level of spatial aggregation had an important influence on model performance with larger geographical areas, such as countries or states, providing better estimations.

The decision as to whom will benefit from surgical procedures is however difficult to ascertain and still remains a challenge to clinicians. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of colonoscopy in the nonagenarian population, and to determine if the outcomes are acceptable for us to continue to offer such interventions. MethodsRetrospective study of patients of Dr. G.R (Gastroenterologist) and Dr. W.B (Colorectal Surgeon) between 1 January 2018 and 31 November 2022. All patients who were >= 90 years old and had a colonoscopy was included in the study. Exclusion criteria were patients who were less than 90 years old, had a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy as part of their surgical procedure. Primary outcome measures: post-colonoscopy complications and length of stay. Secondary outcome measures: reasons for colonoscopy, significant colonoscopy findings, 30-day morbidity and mortality. ResultsSixty patients were included in the study. Median age was 91 (90-100) years old. 33.3% of the patients were males. Seventy percent of the patients were ASA 3. Median length of hospital stay was 1 day. 11.7% of patients were found to have colorectal malignancy. There were no complications after the colonoscopy. There were no 30-day re-admission, morbidity or mortality. ConclusionColonoscopy can be performed safely in carefully selected nonagenarian patients with acceptable low complication rates.

Clinical outcomes including modified Rankin scale (mRS) score, recurrent stroke, and all- cause mortality at 90 days and 36-h symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) were collected. Multivariable logistic regression models and propensity score matching analyses were used to determine the association between treatment groups and clinical outcomes.Results: A total of 1401 minor stroke patients with LVO were included. Overall 251 patients (17.9%) received intravenous t- PA, 722 patients (51.5%) received DAPT, and 428 patients (30.5%) received aspirin alone. The intravenous t- PA was associated with greater proportions of mRS 0- 1 (aspirin versus t- PA: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.80; p = 0.004; DAPT versus t- PA: aOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.19; p = 0.23). Using propensity score matching analyses, the results were similar. There was no difference in 90 -day recurrent stroke among the groups. The rates of all- cause mortality in intravenous t- PA, DAPT, and aspirin groups were 0%, 0.55%, 2.34%, respectively. No patient developed sICH within 36 h of intravenous t- PA.Conclusion: In patients with minor stroke harboring LVO within 4.5-h time window, intravenous t- PA was associated with higher odds for the excellent functional out-come, as compared with the aspirin alone. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted.

The study reveals that Palestinian society is considered an exception and in a great need for good governance as a result of Israel's occupation, administrative and financial corruption inherited among staff, and the Palestinians' dependence on foreign aid. It also reveals significant Palestinian efforts in the area of good governance, manifested in the signing of the convention against corruption, the establishment of the anti-corruption commission and the office of financial and administrative oversight. The results also showed that the adoption of good governance at the Palestinian level will contribute to improving the quality of life and improved relations with donor countries, improved investment environment and access to international aid and empowering marginalized groups to access their rights, and preparing Palestinians for a more realistic development role in the future community and institutional awareness and willingness to change, based on the information available at the appropriate time and place and complementary participatory relationships between different sectors, institutions and society, and everyone's participation in decision-making law-making, policymaking, resource protection, strategic decision-making and social peace. Accordingly, the study recommends that good governance should be applied as a Palestinian priority and that researchers should provide good governance indicators appropriate to Palestinian realities.

At the base of the sequence, a series of gravel and sand facies were deposited, initially as part of a meandering river. Reductions in flow energy of the latter and avulsion led to the development of short-lived channels and episodic backwater environments, the deposits of which are recorded as Facies Associations 1-3. Poorly sorted, probably colluvial deposits formed beyond the limit of the channel (Facies Association 4). Mollusca, Coleoptera, plant macrofossils, pollen and vertebrates recovered from the channel facies indicate broadly similar climatic conditions throughout accretion. Temperature ranges derived from mutual climatic range analysis of the Coleoptera almost completely overlap with those of Cerney Wick at the present day, albeit that winters may have been cooler when the channel was active. Further, the floral and faunal data suggest that the meandering river flowed through an open grassland environment, the latter heavily grazed by large vertebrates, most notably mammoth. Most of the botanical and faunal remains, together with four optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age estimates ranging from 225 +/- 23 to 187 +/- 19 ka, suggest correlation of the channel deposits with MIS 7. The basal deposits (Facies Association 1) yielded the majority of vertebrate remains and all the lithic artefacts, most of which seem likely to have travelled only a short distance. Although only a few artefacts were recovered, they add to the relatively limited evidence of human activity from the upper Thames. The channel deposits are overlain by sheet gravels (Facies Association 5) which are attributed to the Northmoor Member of the Upper Thames Formation. These were likely to have been deposited as bedload in a braided stream environment, while two OSL age estimates of 129 +/- 14 and 112 +/- 11 ka suggest accumulation during MIS 5.	[Hogue, Joshua T.

This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors of suspected dementia in elderly adults in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). MethodsA community-based sample of 355 individuals over 65 years old was selected using multistage probability sampling in Kinshasa. Participants were screened using the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia, Alzheimer's Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Individual Fragility Questionnaire, followed by clinical interview and neurological examination. Suspected dementia diagnoses were made based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria including significant cognitive and functional impairments. Prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using, respectively, regression and logistic regression. ResultsAmong 355 participants (mean age 74, SD = 7; 51% male), the crude prevalence of suspected dementia was 6.2% (9.0% in women and 3.8% in men). Female sex was a significant factor associated with suspected dementia [OR = 2.81, 95% CI (1.08-7.41)]. The prevalence of dementia increased with age (14.0% after 75 years and 23.1% after 85 years), with age being significantly associated with suspected dementia [OR = 5.42, 95% CI (2.86-10.28)]. Greater education was associated with a lower prevalence of suspected dementia [OR = 2.36, 95% CI (2.14-2.94), comparing those with >= 7.3 years of education to those with <7.3 years of education]. Other factors associated with the prevalence of suspected dementia included being widowed (OR = 1.66, 95% CI (1.05-2.61), being retired or semi-retired (OR = 3.25, 95% CI (1.50-7.03)], a diagnosis of anxiety [OR = 2.56, 95% CI (1.05-6.13)], and death of a spouse or a relative after age 65 [OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.58-1.92)]. In contrast, depression [OR = 1.92, 95% CI (0.81-4.57)], hypertension [OR = 1.16, 95% CI (0.79-1.71)], body mass index (BMI) [OR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.40-2.79)], and alcohol consumption [OR = 0.83, 95% CI (0.19-3.58)] were not significantly associated with suspected dementia. ConclusionsThis study found a prevalence of suspected dementia in Kinshasa/DRC similar to other developing countries and Central African countries. Reported risk factors provide information to identify high-risk individuals and develop preventive strategies in this setting.

Scanning electron microscopy depicted the encapsulation of swollen starch within a protective sheet developed as a result of gum addition and starch gelatinisation. The Fourier transform infrared spectra denoted a shift from crystalline towards amorphous state in starch as a consequence of partial gelatinisation. The secondary structure of protein signified a drop in the alpha-helix structure and thereby enhanced the in vitro protein digestibility of the pregelatinised samples. Multivariate principal component analysis was utilised to validate the differences between the parameters. The overall study inferred that the QPM owned an excellent potentiality for the development of nutrient-dense pasta by employing the functionality of gums and pre-gelatinisation treatment.

J	Kim, YSG; Petscher, Y				Kim, Young-Suk Grace; Petscher, Yaacov			Do Spelling and Vocabulary Improve Classification Accuracy of Children's Reading Difficulties Over and Above Word Reading?	READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article							SIMPLE VIEW; ORAL LANGUAGE; DOUBLE DISSOCIATION; COGNITIVE SKILLS; COMPREHENSION; KINDERGARTEN; DYSLEXIA; LITERACY; FLUENCY; ABILITY	It is widely recognized that individuals with dyslexia have difficulties with word reading and spelling, and individuals with reading comprehension difficulties have low vocabulary knowledge. However, little is known about the extent to which spelling and vocabulary are informative of reading difficulties. In the present study, we investigated whether information on students' spelling and vocabulary in kindergarten increases the precision of identifying students with reading difficulties, using longitudinal data from kindergarten to Grade 2. The sample was composed of 247 kindergartners (55% boys; 56% White children, 35% African American children, and 5% mixed-race children; 72% from low SES) who were followed to Grade 2. Spelling improved the accuracy of identifying students who experienced word reading difficulties in kindergarten and Grade 1. In contrast, vocabulary did not improve the accuracy of identifying students with reading difficulties over and above word reading and spelling. These results indicate the importance and utility of including spelling, in addition to word reading, as an integral part of accurately identifying children with reading difficulties as early as kindergarten. In addition, although vocabulary did not contribute additional predictive power, it is likely to exert its influence at a later phase of reading development.

We aimed to estimate the association of chronic hypertension on adverse maternal and infant outcomes and assess the impact of antihypertensive treatment and these outcomes. Methods and ResultsUsing data from the French national health data system, we identified and included in the CONCEPTION cohort all women in France who delivered their first child between 2010 and 2018. Chronic hypertension before pregnancy was identified through antihypertensive medication purchases and by diagnosis during hospitalization. We assessed the incidence risk ratios (IRRs) of maternofetal outcomes using Poisson models. A total of 2 822 616 women were included, and 42 349 (1.5%) had chronic hypertension and 22 816 were treated during pregnancy. In Poisson models, the adjusted IRR (95% CI) of maternofetal outcomes for women with hypertension were as follows: 1.76 (1.54-2.01) for infant death, 1.73 (1.60-1.87) for small gestational age, 2.14 (1.89-2.43) for preterm birth, 4.58 (4.41-4.75) for preeclampsia, 1.33 (1.27-1.39) for cesarean delivery, 1.84 (1.47-2.31) for venous thromboembolism, 2.62 (1.71-4.01) for stroke or acute coronary syndrome, and 3.54 (2.11-5.93) for maternal death postpartum. In women with chronic hypertension, being treated with an antihypertensive drug during pregnancy was associated with a significantly lower risk of obstetric hemorrhage, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome during pregnancy and postpartum. ConclusionsChronic hypertension is a major risk factor of infant and maternal negative outcomes. In women with chronic hypertension, the risk of pregnancy and postpartum cardiovascular events may be decreased by antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy.

The article reflects on the considerable variation of Europe Day celebration practices, proposes a typology of Europe Day events and reflects on their merit in eliciting reason- and affect-driven institutional approaches in the strategic promotion of European identity to the public. The article employs affect theory to reflect on the relationship between emotions and identity. It argues that institutional efforts aimed to promote European identity within the Europe Day platform rely on actualizing the affective potential underpinning collective identities with the view to compel public support for European integration by inciting emotional engagement and boosting the public's affective investment.

Assessment of the Crop Forcing Technique and Irrigation Strategy on the Ripening of Tempranillo Grapes in a Semiarid Climate	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH			English	Article							VITIS-VINIFERA L.; CABERNET-SAUVIGNON; VINE REGROWTH; WATER-STRESS; BERRY GROWTH; PHENOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY; WINE QUALITY; FRUIT; GRAPEVINES; TEMPERATURE	Background and Aims. High temperatures during grape ripening have a negative effect on the winemaking characteristics of musts. The crop forcing technique delays ripening to a period when temperatures are lower. The objective of this study is to provide information to winemakers and grape growers on how the delay in ripening caused by crop forcing can affect berry performance. Methods and Results. This study of 3 growing seasons (2017-2019) analyzes the effect of this technique in a vineyard of the Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo in Extremadura, together with two irrigation strategies. The grapevines were forced 4 and 22 days after anthesis (F1 and F2, respectively), compared to a treatment without crop forcing techniques (NF). Each treatment was subjected to two irrigation strategies: to cover the water needs of the plants (C) and deficit irrigation during preveraison (RI). Crop forcing delayed the harvest between 32 and 56 days on average in relation to NF. Crop forcing and irrigation strategy modified berry composition at harvest: C-F1 and C-F2 had higher total polyphenol and anthocyanin concentrations, total acidity, malic acid content, and lower pH relative to C-NF; RI-NF increased total anthocyanin concentration and pH and decreased titratable acidity value. Conclusions. Crop forcing is able to delay grape ripening to lower temperature periods. This is a promising technique for restoring the coupling between phenolic and technological ripeness. The combination of both crop forcing and deficit irrigation strategy maintains the berry quality while improving water use efficiency. Significance of the Study. The present work shows how the "crop-forcing" technique is effective in modifying the relationship between different parameters that determine the characteristics of berries throughout ripening as a raw material for winemaking, compared to vines with traditional winter pruning, under different irrigation strategies.To the memory of Jordi Marsal	[Lavado, Nieves; Uriarte, David; Mancha, Luis A.; Henar Prieto, M.] CICYTEX Junta Extremadura, Badajoz, Spain; [Lavado, Nieves; Moreno, Daniel; Valdes, M.

Pear fruits have demonstrated a considerable improvement in sugar quality during their long history of selection. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms accompanying the changes in fruit sugar content as a result of selection by horticulturists. Here, we identified a calcium-dependent protein kinase (PbCPK28), which is located on LG15 and is present within a selective sweep region, thus linked to the quantitative trait loci for soluble solids. Association analysis indicates that a single nucleotide polymorphism-13 variation (SNP13(T/C)) in the PbCPK28 regulatory region led to fructose content diversity in pear. Elevated expression of PbCPK28 resulted in significantly increased fructose levels in pear fruits. Furthermore, PbCPK28 interacts with and phosphorylates PbTST4, a proton antiporter, thereby coupling the sugar import into the vacuole with proton export. We demonstrated that residues S277 and S314 of PbTST4 are crucial for its function. Additionally, PbCPK28 interacts with and phosphorylates the vacuolar hydrogen proton pump PbVHA-A1, which could provide proton motive forces for PbTST4. We also found that the T11 and Y120 phosphorylation sites in PbVHA-A1 are essential for its function. Evolution analysis and yeast-two-hybrid results support that the CPK-TST/CPK-VHA-A regulatory network is highly conserved in plants, especially the corresponding phosphorylation sites. Together, our work identifies an agriculturally important natural variation and an important regulatory network, allowing genetic improvement of fruit sugar contents in pears through modulation of PbCPK28 expression and phosphorylation of PbTST4 and PbVHA-A1.

This study examines the issues of improving the content of educational programs (EP) for teacher training, in the context of the current stage of development of secondary education. The applied value of the research is in determining the main criteria for assessing the content of EP and directions for their improvement. The high quality of EP for the preparation of teachers determines the quality of subsequent teaching in secondary school, which is extremely important in the context of the quality of teaching and the final level of knowledge of students. It was concluded that improving the content of EP at the stage of training future teachers has a positive effect on the development of the entire education system, is of great importance in the light of strengthening the system of university training for teachers and educating qualified teaching staff.

Using panel data from surveys of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Vietnam over a 10-year period and a semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model approach, we provide empirical support for the "greasing-the-wheels" hypothesis of firm survival. Effects are found to be more pronounced for formally registered and larger firms, explained by their greater bargaining power vis-a-vis public officials. Moreover, bribery as a "risk-of-exit" reducing strategy is found only for firms not institutionally or financially constrained and for firms operating in sectors with low levels of competition.

J	Qin, SS; Vinluan, J; McCahy, P				Qin, Shane Shen; Vinluan, Jessele; McCahy, Philip			Analysis of potential clinical management issues in unreported mortality data from an Australian health service	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article; Early Access						audit; clinical management issues; dataset; health services; mortality		BackgroundWe have previously reported incomplete data submission to the Victorian Audit of Surgical Mortality (VASM) by a large health service. We have further examined the source health service clinical data to assess whether any clinical management issues (CMI) occurred and should have been reported. MethodsThe previous study identified 46 deaths that should have been reported to VASM. The hospital records of these patients were further analysed. Data recorded included the patient's age, gender, admission type and clinical course. Any potential clinical management issues were recorded and classified using the VASM definitions (area of consideration or concern, adverse event). ResultsMedian age of the deceased patients was 72 (range 17-94), with 17 (37%) being female. Patients were under the care of nine different specialties with general surgery being the most common (18/46). Only four (8.7%) of the cases were electively admitted. 17 (37%) patients had at least one CMI with 10 (21.7%) classified as adverse events. Most deaths were not considered preventable. ConclusionThe proportion of CMI in the unreported deaths was consistent with the previously reported VASM data, however current findings show a high percentage of adverse events. The underreporting may be due to inexperienced medical staff or coders, poor quality notes or confusion about what should be reported. These findings reinforce the importance of data collection and reporting at the health service level, and a number of important lessons and opportunities to improve patient safety have been lost.

Satisfaction following RTKA is poorly described within the literature, resulting in difficulty for clinicians to manage patient expectations and obtain informed consent. MethodsWe investigated postoperative satisfaction of RTKA patients by a single surgeon, using a single prosthesis, at a single institution. Patient satisfaction was assessed using structured telephone assessment questionnaires and review of orthopaedic/hospital records. The effect of patient and surgical characteristics on satisfaction was assessed using correlation coefficients and binary logistic regression in SPSS. ResultsTwo hundred and two RTKAs were performed in 178 patients between 2004 and 2015 inclusive. One hundred and twenty-four patients (143 RTKAs) were contactable to complete satisfaction assessment. Eighty-five percent of patients were satisfied and would have the RTKA again, 8% were unsure, 7% would not. Mean reported satisfaction on a numerical scale (1-10) was 8.17 (range 1-10), with 74% of patients scoring 8 or above, and 35% of patients scoring 10. The Mahomed Satisfaction Scale outcomes demonstrated a mean score of 87.7. High positive correlation was found between assessment tools. Logistic regression analysis identified factors contributing to satisfaction included ROM, OKS, BMI, and surgical time. ConclusionThis cohort demonstrated high patient satisfaction rate following RTKA, utilizing simple and reliable outcome measurement tools. We found a high positive correlation between methods of assessment, and moderate positive correlation between satisfaction and functional outcomes. These results contribute to the understanding of satisfaction in RTKA patients, which may assist in informing patients of expected post-operative outcomes.

Data included for analysis were 10,615 first lactation monthly test-day milk yield records (5th, 35th, 65th, horizontal ellipsis , 305th) from 965 Murrah buffaloes for the period 1975-2018. Cubic to octic-order orthogonal polynomials with homogeneous residual variances were used for the estimation of genetic parameters. Random regression models with sixth-order were selected based on goodness of fit criteria like lower AIC, BIC and residual variance. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.079 (TD6) to 0.21(TD10). For both ends of lactation, the additive genetic and environmental variances were higher and ranged from 0.21 +/- 0.12 (TD6) to 0.85 +/- 0.35 kg(2) (TD1) and 3.74 +/- 0.36 (TD11) to 1.36 +/- 0.14 kg(2) (TD9), respectively. Between adjacent test-day records, genetic correlation estimates ranged from 0.09 +/- 0.31 (TD1 and TD2) to 0.97 +/- 0.03 (TD3 and TD4; TD4 and TD5), but values gradually declined as the distance between test days increased. Negative genetic correlations were also obtained between TD1 with TD3 to TD9, TD2 with TD9 and TD10, and TD3 with TD10. On the basis of genetic correlations, models with 5 and/or 6 test-days combination were able to account for 86.1%-98.7% of variation along the lactation. Models with fourth and fifth-order LP functions were considered to account for variance with combinations of 5 and/or 6 test-day milk yields. The model with 6 test-day combinations had a higher rank correlation (0.93) with model using 11 monthly test-day milk yield records. On the basis of relative efficiency, the model with 6 monthly test day combinations with fifth-order was more efficient (maximum 99%) than the model using 11 monthly test-day milk yield records. Looking into the similar accuracy with the 11TD model, and the low resources requirement, we recommend the use of the "6 test-day combination model" for sire evaluation. These models may help in reducing the cost and time for data recording of milk yield.

J	Takeuchi, H; Watabe, K				Takeuchi, Hiroyoshi; Watabe, Kei			Does short-term antipsychotic discontinuation of up to 3 weeks worsen symptoms in acute schizophrenia? A pooled analysis of placebo washout data	PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						antipsychotics; discontinuation; placebo washout; schizophrenia	NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE; DOUBLE-BLIND; LURASIDONE; WITHDRAWAL	Aim: This study aimed to examine symptom changes during short-term discontinuation of antipsychotics up to 3 weeks including the placebo washout phase in acute schizophrenia. Methods: The data from three double-blind, randomized, controlled trials comparing lurasidone versus placebo in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia were analyzed. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) scores. The scores before and after the antipsychotic discontinuation phase were compared, and factors associated with score changes were explored. Results: Among 2154 patients participating in the trials, 600 who received antipsychotic monotherapy and completed the antipsychotic discontinuation phase were included in the analysis. No patients received clozapine. The mean duration of the discontinuation phase was 5.9 +/- 2.5 days. The PANSS total and CGI-S scores significantly changed from 94.0 +/- 9.5 to 95.4 +/- 10.5 (P < 0.001) and from 4.9 +/- 0.6 to 4.9 +/- 0.7 (P = 0.041), respectively, during this phase; however, the absolute difference was minimal. The score changes were not associated with the type or dose of prior antipsychotics, or the duration or strategy (abrupt vs gradual) of antipsychotic discontinuation. Conclusions: Symptoms may not worsen to a clinically meaningful degree after short-term discontinuation of non-clozapine antipsychotics up to 3 weeks in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia, suggesting that antipsychotic efficacy persists at least several days after discontinuation. This finding supports once-daily dosing regimen of antipsychotics and abrupt antipsychotic discontinuation when switching to another antipsychotic.

Researchers have fabricated a variety of tissue engineering scaffolds to enhance bone healing and regeneration through the accumulation of type H vessels. However, only a limited number of reviews discussed the tissue engineering strategies for type H vessel regulation. The object of this review is to summary the current utilizes of bone tissue engineering to regulate type H vessels through various signal pathways including Notch, PDGF-BB, Slit3, HIF-1 alpha, and VEGF signaling. Moreover, we give an insightful overview of recent research progress about the morphological, spatial and age-dependent characteristics of type H blood vessels. Their unique role in tying angiogenesis and osteogenesis together via blood flow, cellular microenvironment, immune system and nervous system are also summarized. This review article would provide an insight into the combination of tissue engineering scaffolds with type H vessels and identify future perspectives for vasculized tissue engineering research.

A comprehensive literature examination till January 2023 was implemented and 1457 linked studies were appraised. The picked studies contained 772 open RC subjects in the picked studies' baseline, 436 of them were enhanced recovery after RC, and 336 were open RC. Odds ratio (OR) in addition to 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the consequence of enhanced recovery after RC on wound dehiscence after open RC by the dichotomous styles and a fixed or random model. The ER after RC caused significantly lower wound dehiscence (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.89, P = .02) with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 46%) compared with open RC. The ER after RC caused significantly lower wound dehiscence compared with open RC. Thorough precaution should be taken when commerce with the consequences because a limited number of studies were found and selected for this meta-analysis.

Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic metabolic cell death linked to numerous diseases. It is currently unknown whether ferroptosis takes part in MeHg-induced kidney damage. Here, we established a model of acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice by gavage with different doses of MeHg (0, 40, 80, 160 mu mol/kg). Serological analysis revealed elevated levels of UA, UREA, and CREA; H&E staining showed variable degrees of renal tubule injury; qRT-PCR detection displayed increased expression of KIM-1 and NGAL in the groups with MeHg treatment, indicated that MeHg successfully induced AKI. Furthermore, MDA levels enhanced in renal tissues of mice with MeHg exposure whereas GSH levels decreased; ACSL4 and PTGS2 nucleic acid levels elevated while SLC7A11 levels reduced; transmission electron microscopy illustrated that the density of the mitochondrial membrane thickened and the ridge reduced considerably; protein levels for 4HNE and TfR1 improved since GPX4 levels declined, all these results implying the involvement of ferroptosis as a result of MeHg exposure. Additionally, the observed elevation in the protein levels of NLRP3, p-p65, p-p38, p-ERK1/2, and KEAP1 in tandem with downregulated Nrf2 expression levels indicate the involvement of the NF-kappa B/NLRP3/MAPK/Nrf2 pathways. All the above findings suggested that ferroptosis and the NF-kappa B/NLRP3/MAPK/Nrf2 pathways are implicated in MeHg-induced AKI, thereby providing a theoretical foundation and reference for future investigations into the prevention and treatment of MeHg-induced kidney injury.

Aging accompanied by oxidative stress leads to a decrease in Sirt1 levels and activity, but the regulatory mechanism that connects these events remains unclear. Here, we reported that Nur77, which shares similar biological pathways with Sirt1, was also decreased with age in multiple organs. Our in vivo and in vitro results revealed that Nur77 and Sirt1 decreased during aging and oxidative stress-induced cell senescence. Deletion of Nr4a1 shortened the lifespan and accelerated the aging process in multiple mouse tissues. Overexpression of Nr4a1 protected the Sirt1 protein from proteasomal degradation through negative transcriptional regulation of the E3 ligase MDM2. Our results showed that Nur77 deficiency markedly aggravated aging-related nephropathy and elucidated a key role for Nur77 in the stabilization of Sirt1 homeostasis during renal aging. We proposed a model wherein a reduction of Nur77 in response to oxidative stress promotes Sirt1 protein degradation through MDM2, which triggers cell senescence. This creates additional oxidative stress and provides positive feedback for premature aging by further decreasing Nur77 expression.

Although cancer therapy including radiotherapy and anti-cancer drugs can kill malignant cells within the tumor, cancer cells can develop a wide range of mechanisms to resist the toxic effects of anti-cancer agents. Cancer cells may provide some mechanisms to resist oxidative stress and escape from apoptosis and attack by the immune system. Furthermore, cancer cells may resist senescence, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and autophagic cell death by modulating several critical genes. The development of these mechanisms leads to resistance to anti-cancer drugs and also radiotherapy. Resistance to therapy can increase mortality and reduce survival following cancer therapy. Thus, overcoming mechanisms of resistance to cell death in malignant cells can facilitate tumor elimination and increase the efficiency of anti-cancer therapy. Natural-derived molecules are intriguing agents that may be suggested to be used as an adjuvant in combination with other anticancer drugs or radiotherapy to sensitize cancer cells to therapy with at least side effects. This paper aims to review the potential of triptolide for inducing various types of cell death in cancer cells. We review the induction or resistance to different cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis, autophagic cell death, senescence, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and necrosis following the administration of triptolide. We also review the safety and future perspectives for triptolide and its derivatives in experimental and human studies. The anticancer potential of triptolide and its derivatives may make them effective adjuvants for enhancing tumor suppression in combination with anticancer therapy.

Lycodon striatus sensu lato is widely distributed throughout South and Central Asia and mimics elapids. Based on phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA, we demonstrate that populations from (i) eastern and central Peninsular India plus Sri Lanka and (ii) south-western parts of Central Asia form two different clades representing two distinct species: L. striatus sensu stricto and L. bicolor comb. nov. respectively. These two clades are sisters to L. deccanensis (in the case of L. striatus) and L. jara (in the case of L. bicolor) and together form two main sister radiations. Although the external morphological variability is high in both species, the genetic variability is higher only in L. striatus but not distinct enough to represent more than one species if using the phylogenetic or biological species concept. The phylogeny of the L. aulicus group hints at Sri Lankan L. striatus, likely having evolved in continental Asia through a probable overland dispersal across the Bay of Bengal (present Palk Strait) into Sri Lanka. This dispersal may have been facilitated by low sea levels during the Pleistocene glaciations when Sri Lanka was connected to mainland India. After considering genetic divergence (with a p-distance of 1.8%-2.1% in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene) and morphological evidence, we synonymize the Sri Lankan subspecies, L. s. sinhaleyus Deraniyagala, 1955, with L. striatus sensu stricto. The eastern and central Indian L. striatus (i.e. L. striatus sensu stricto) is morphologically distinct and deeply divergent genetically compared to Tajik and Pakistani L. bicolor with a p-distance of 13.6% in cytochrome b gene (mtDNA). Interestingly, L. bicolor is conspecific (p-distance 1.4%) with L. mackinnoni, a western Himalayan endemic, and it reveals intraspecific clinal variation.	[Amarasinghe, Amarasinghe A.

Simple linear regression models may not be appropriate, especially when the response variable is skewed or count. When the response distribution follows the exponential family; however, the generalized linear model (GLM) gives a more flexible approach. The goal of this study is to use the Poisson hurdle model to provide GLM-based Shewhart-type control charts. To calculate monitoring statistics, the Pearson residuals (PRs) are obtained using the Poisson hurdle model. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation analysis is used to analyze the attributes of the suggested charts. Besides this, a real-life data set is used to show the practical application of the charts.

The size of nanocrystalline (similar to 13 nm) materials (BCC and BCC/rGO) was confirmed using powder X-ray diffraction patterns. The effect of rGO, BCC, and BCC/rGO on the thermal decomposition of 3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazol-5-one (NTO) and ammonium perchlorate (AP) was investigated using simultaneous thermal analysis. Non-isothermal isoconversion method was used to calculate the activation energy of AP and NTO with and without rGO, BCC, and BCC/rGO. The thermal analysis suggests that in the presence of BCC and BCC/rGO, the thermal decomposition exotherm of NTO was lowered to similar to 259, and similar to 228 degrees C, respectively, and that of AP was lowered to 355, and 345 degrees C, respectively. BCC and BCC/rGO exhibit very good catalytic activity for the thermal decomposition of NTO by lowering NTO's activation energy barrier by similar to 179 and 261 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The activation energy calculations for low thermal decomposition and high thermal decomposition of AP (similar to 95 kJ mol(-1) average) do not provide conclusive evidence to confirm the catalytic influence of BCC and BCC/rGO. The composition NTO+BCC has a lower activation energy barrier (similar to 121 kJ mol(-1)) than pure NTO which makes the thermal decomposition of NTO+BCC more favorable than pure NTO making its application in insensitive munitions more favorable. AP+BCC decomposes within a short temperature range and hence, it can be used in solid rocket propellants requiring faster decomposition of AP in place of pure AP.

In recent years, satisfactory results for oncolytic virus therapy (OVT) are achieved at both the cellular and organismal levels, and efforts are being increasingly directed toward clinical trials. Unfortunately, OVT remains ineffective in these trials, especially when performed using only a single OV reagent. In contrast, integrated approaches, such as using immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, alongside OVT have demonstrated considerable efficacy. The challenges of OVT in clinical efficacy include the restricted scope of intratumoral injections and poor targeting of intravenous administration. Further optimization of OVT delivery is needed before OVs become a viable therapy for tumor treatment. In this review, the development process and antitumor mechanisms of OVs are introduced.

The oils used as the dispersed phase vary in dynamic viscosity, while density and interfacial tension are nearly constant. The performance of a population balance model for partially mobile interfaces and its ability to predict steady-state and dynamic Sauter mean diameters and the complete drop size distributions as a function of dispersed phase viscosity and different process parameters are evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of different daughter drop size distribution shapes on simulation results is quantified.

First, we derive the solution of linear FSDS via delayed matrix functions of Mittag-Leffler (M-L). Subsequently, by virtue of the controllability Grammian matrix, we explore the relatively exact controllability of linear FSDS. In addition, with the aid of Jensen's inequality, Holder's inequality, and Ito's isometry, the existence and uniqueness of the considered nonlinear FSDS are investigated by employing Banach contraction principle. Thereafter, the relatively exact controllability of nonlinear FSDS is discussed. Finally, the theoretical results are supported through examples.

Combined proliferation and apoptosis index provides better risk stratification in breast cancer	HISTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						apoptosis; breast cancer; count; methods	PROGNOSTIC MARKER; CELL-PROLIFERATION; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; BCL-2; P53; ASSOCIATION; SURVIVAL; FAMILY; MYBL2; DNA	AimsBreast cancer (BC) risk stratification is critical for predicting behaviour and guiding management decision-making. Despite the well-established prognostic value of cellular proliferation in BC, the interplay between proliferation and apoptosis remains to be defined. In this study, we hypothesised that the combined proliferation and apoptosis indices can provide a more accurate in-vivo growth rate measure and a precise prognostic predictor. Methods and resultsApoptotic and mitotic figures were counted in whole slide images (WSI) generated from haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of 1545 BC cases derived from two well-defined BC cohorts. Counts were carried out visually within defined areas. There was a significant correlation between mitosis and apoptosis scores. High apoptotic counts were associated with features of aggressive behaviour, including high grade, high pleomorphism score and hormonal receptor negativity. Although the mitotic index (MI) and apoptotic index (AI) were independent prognostic indicators, the prognostic value was synergistically higher when combined. BC patients with a high combined AI and MI had the shortest survival. Replacing the mitosis score with the mitosis-apoptosis index in the Nottingham grading system revealed that the modified grade with the new score had a higher significant association with BC-specific survival with a higher hazard ratio. ConclusionApoptotic figures count provides additional prognostic value in BC when combined with MI; such a combination can be implemented to assess the behaviour of BC and provides an accurate prognostic indicator. This can be considered when using artificial intelligence algorithms to assess proliferation in BC.

In doing so, we develop a multi-sectoral distortion-ridden general equilibrium model which applies to small open developing economies. Lockdown results in supply-chain disruptions (SCDs), physical restrictions on labour gathering, adverse demand shock and an escalation of demand for the high-skilled capital-intensive product. Not only factor intensity ranking but also contact intensity of sectors has several dimensions. These dimensions include inter alia female labour force participation, the burden of unpaid domestic chores on women and gender wage disparity with unemployment as well.

Here, we report the synthesis of a zinc-based MOF containing a three-dimensional (3D) linker, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid, with high thermal stability towards the separation of hexane isomers. The incorporation of the 3D linker enhances the structural stability and provides well-defined pore apertures/channels with sub-angstrom ngstrom precision. This precision allowed for the separation of similarly sized hexane isomers based on subtle differences in their kinetic diameters. Multi-component liquid phase batch experiments confirmed the separation of hexanes mixture into linear, monobranched, and dibranched isomers. This work represents a significant milestone in the construction of stable Zn-based MOFs and the incorporation of 3D linkers as a potential solution to challenging separations.

However, its excessively large ionic radius makes it difficult to achieve either interstitial doping or substitutional doping under mild conditions. Herein, a hierarchical nanostructured electrocatalyst with enriched amorphous/crystalline interfaces for high-efficiency alkaline HER is reported, which is composed of amorphous/crystalline (Co, Ni)(11)(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) homogeneous hierarchical structure with an ultra-low doped Pt (Pt-a/c-NiHPi). Benefiting from the structural flexibility of the amorphous component, extremely low Pt (0.21 wt.%, totally 3.31 mu g Pt on 1 cm(-2) NF) are stably doped on it via a simple two-phase hydrothermal method. The DFT calculations show that due to the strongly electron transfer between the crystalline/amorphous components at the interfaces, electrons finally concentrate toward Pt and Ni in the amorphous components, thus the electrocatalyst has near-optimal energy barriers and adsorption energy for H2O* and H*. With the above benefits, the obtained catalyst exhibits an exceptionally high MA (39.1 mA mu g(Pt)(-1)) at 70 mV, which is almost the highest level among the reported Pt-based electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to explore time trends in clinical response and clinical remission rates in Crohn's disease (CD) patients treated with biologics while discussing the need for new strategies. MethodsMEDLINE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Science databases were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials with biological agents in moderate-to-severe CD patients. Sub-group and meta-regression analyses compared treatment and placebo by calculating the pooled odds ratios of clinical remission and clinical response, across time categories and publication year. We also estimated the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission and clinical response by comparing both groups according to the publication year. ResultsTwenty-five trials were included in the systematic review, which enrolled 8879 patients between 1997 and 2022. The clinical remission and clinical response odds, in induction and maintenance, have been constant over time, as no statistically significant differences were found between time categories (interaction p-values: clinical remission [induction, p = 0.19; maintenance, p = 0.24]; clinical response [induction, p = 0.43; maintenance, p = 0.59]). In meta-regression analyses, publication year did not influence these outcomes (clinical remission [induction, OR 1.01{95% CI 0.97-1.05}, p = 0.72; clinical response [induction, OR 1.01{95% CI 0.97-1.04]; p = 0.63; maintenance, OR 1.03{95% CI 0.98-1.07}; p = 0.21]), with the exception of clinical remission in maintenance studies, which presented a decreased effect (odds ratio 0.97{95% CI 0.94-1.00}, p = 0.03]). ConclusionsOur review highlights that the odds of clinical outcomes in CD patients receiving biological treatment relative to placebo have been stable in the last decades.

In this report, we explore the possibility to further increase the overall properties of this high-entropy carbide ceramic (HECC) through introducing SiC particle (SiCP). To this end, a series of (NbTaZrW)C-xSiC ceramic composites (x = 0/5/15/30/50 vol.%) were fabricated using spark plasma sintering (SPS), their microstructure and mechanical properties were characterized. Our results reveal a grain refinement effects of SiCP, an agglomeration of SiCP with (1 0 0) plane preferentially perpendicular to the SPS-pressing direction and the formation of a transition region with various stoichiometric ratio of (NbTaZrW)(x)C-1-(x) in the (NbTaZrW)C-SiCP vicinity. The elastic modulus, microhardness, and flexural strength of the HECCs show tight positive relations with the SiCP content and the beneficial effect of SiCP to the fracture toughness of (NbTaZrW)C becomes evident once the content of SiCP reaches 30 vol.%. Altogether, (NbTaZrW)C-50%SiC, which has a microhardness of 22 GPa, a flexural strength of 455 MPa, and an indentation fracture toughness of 6.54 MPa m(1/2), presents the optimal combination of mechanical properties among the investigated composites. Mechanistically, the strengthening effect of SiCP introduction arises from the intrinsic high hardness of SiCP and the SiCP-induced grain refinement and the toughening effect is mainly associated with crack bridging mechanism.

Herein, a dendrite-free 3D composite Li anode (Li-B@SSM) is prepared by mechanical rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported by Li-B composite and lithiophobic stainless-steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic-lithiophobic dual-skeletons, the Li-B@SSM anode shows an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm(-2)/1 mAh cm(-2). It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site-selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic-lithiophobic dual-skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of "dead" Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li-B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li-B@SSM|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles while the Li-B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high-efficiency Li metal anodes toward practical applications.

Alabama Bass Alter Reservoir Black Bass Species Assemblages When Introduced Outside Their Native Range	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SHOAL BASS; LARGEMOUTH BASS; SPOTTED BASS; REDEYE BASS; MICROPTERUS-COOSAE; ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS; SMALLMOUTH BASS; TEMPORAL TRENDS; HYBRIDIZATION; FISH	Black bass Micropterus spp. stocked outside of their native range have often been implicated in declines of native fishes, but impacts of these stockings on native congeners have been examined less commonly and almost never in reservoirs. Relative abundance and creel data were obtained from seven reservoirs (632-13,156 ha) in four southeastern states where Alabama Bass M. henshalli had been illegally stocked. Genetics data for black bass were collected in nine more reservoirs in five southeastern states where similar introductions occurred. In each case, Alabama Bass introduction was swiftly followed by sweeping changes in the black bass composition. Largemouth Bass M. salmoides relative abundance declined by 42-77% after Alabama Bass introduction in four of five reservoirs, but total black bass relative abundance was unchanged in three of them, indicating that Alabama Bass essentially replaced Largemouth Bass. Alabama Bass or their hybrids dominated the black bass genetic sample in five of nine reservoirs, and pure specimens of non-Alabama Bass species composed < 50% of the sample in six of nine reservoirs. Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu were virtually extirpated via hybridization with Alabama Bass in two of the study reservoirs, and genetically pure fish were rare in several others. These changes occurred over relatively short time intervals, often within 10 years after detection of Alabama Bass, stressing the need for continual vigilance via routine monitoring and a proactive public relations campaign to discourage and limit new introductions. The leading edge of the Alabama Bass invasion now encompasses several notable Smallmouth Bass fisheries in North Carolina and is on the border of numerous others in Tennessee, Virginia, and beyond. The spread of nonnative black bass, such as the Alabama Bass highlighted in this article, constitutes one of the greatest threats to conserving native black bass fisheries.

The first section collected physicians' personal data and centers' general characteristics, second assessed the approach to patients colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), while the third consisted of the infection risk related to cardiovascular devices, and antimicrobial treatment data, the last focused on donor's colonization.Results: A total of 56 answers from 26 different countries were collected, mostly from Europe (n = 30) and the USA (n = 16). A first-generation cephalosporin (58.9%) or a combination therapy with vancomycin (10.7%) were the most frequently prescribed antimicrobial prophylaxis. Roughly 30% of the centers used different antimicrobial prophylaxis,mostly including Gram negative bacteria coverage. The frequency of screening for multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria was higher in Europe, where the percentage of centers providing screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (46.7%) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) (53.3%) was higher than in other geographic area (p = .019; p = .013, respectively).Conclusion: This survey highlights a heterogeneity of clinical practice concerning antimicrobial prophylaxis at transplant. The concern for potential Gram-negative bacteria infection was responsible for broader antimicrobial coverage in 30% of centers.

[Ch][TAPSO] being a basic IL has also been observed to extract acidic compounds such as rhodamine B from IL- immiscible organic solvent such as acetone through acid-base interaction. The extraction process of fluorescent dye rhodamine B was determined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The observed percentage extraction rate is 100 % upto 6 mM solution of rhodamine in acetone. This method results in faster reaction with operational simplicity and excellent yields of the products. Furthermore, the catalyst has a great capacity for reutilisation.	[Verma, Usha Kumari; Manhas, Akanksha; Kapoor, Kamal K.

It was rarely investigated using three-dimensional (3D) imaging with tumor volume on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Purpose: To investigate the VDT of breast cancer using 3D tumor volume assessment on serial breast MRIs. Study Type: Retrospective.Subjects: Sixty women (age at diagnosis: 57 +/- 10 years) with breast cancer, assessed by two or more breast MRI examinations. The median interval time was 791 days (range: 70-3654 days).Field Strength/Sequence: 3-T, fast spin-echo T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and gradient echo dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.Assessment: Three radiologists independently reviewed the morphological, DWI, and T2WI features of lesions. The whole tumor was segmented to measure the volume on contrast-enhanced images. The exponential growth model was fitted in the 11 patients with at least three MRI examinations. The VDT of breast cancer was calculated using the modified Schwartz equation.Statistical Tests: Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-squared test, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Fleiss kappa coefficients. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The exponential growth model was evaluated using the adjusted R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE). Results: The median tumor diameter was 9.7 mm and 15.2 mm on the initial and final MRI, respectively. The median adjusted R-2 and RMSE of the 11 exponential models were 0.97 and 15.8, respectively. The median VDT was 540 days (range: 68-2424 days). For invasive ductal carcinoma (N = 33), the median VDT of the non-luminal type was shorter than that of the luminal type (178 days vs. 478 days). On initial MRI, breast cancer manifesting as a focus or mass lesion showed a shorter VDT than that of a non-mass enhancement (NME) lesion (median VDT: 426 days vs. 665 days).Data Conclusion: A shorter VDT was observed in breast cancer manifesting as focus or mass as compared to an NME lesion.

Herein, a novel solvent-exchange-assisted wet-annealing strategy is proposed to prepare high performance poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels by extensively tuning the macromolecular chain movement and optimizing the polymer network. The reinforcing and toughening mechanisms are found to be "macromolecule crystallization and entanglement". These hydrogels have large tensile strengths up to 11.19 +/- 0.27 MPa and extremely high fracture strains of 1879 +/- 10%. In addition, the fracture energy and fatigue threshold can reach as high as 25.39 +/- 6.64 kJ m(-2) and approximate to 1233 J m(-2), respectively. These superb mechanical properties compare favorably to those of other tough hydrogels, organogels, and even natural tendons and synthetic rubbers. This work provides a new and effective method to fabricate superstrong, tough, stretchable, and anti-fatigue hydrogels with potential applications in artificial tendons and ligaments.

Several biotechnology companies have established proprietary conjugation technologies using specific enzymes. Most enzymatic modifications require the use of tags and enzyme-recognition moieties. Therefore, site-specific and "tag-free" modifications are required to avoid the time-consuming process of installing tags on proteins. Lipoic acid ligase A (LplA), is a recently reported enzyme having the potential to be used for the site-specific modification of native antibodies without requiring a tag moiety. In this manuscript, investigations focused on the optimization of this enzymatic modification applied to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) production. First, an analysis of the pH dependency was performed. Next, the effects of excess adenosine mono- and di-phosphate were also examined to show that these by-products from LplA modification did not have a significant impact on inhibiting the reaction efficiency. Furthermore, ADC syntheses by LplA-mediated tag-free modification followed by click reaction were achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of actual ADC synthesis produced by LplA modification of tag-free antibodies. A stability assessment of the resulting ADCs indicated that this enzymatic approach is a promising tool for installing biorthogonal groups to native antibodies for the next generation of ADC manufacturing.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis is essential to counteract neuronal apoptosis. ER stress, an integral part of ER homeostasis, was observed in a rat model of chronic cervical cord compression in our previous study. However, the correlation between ER homeostasis and CSM remains unknown. The antioxidant melatonin is known to exert therapeutic effects in acute spinal cord injury, but the specific effects and their potential mechanisms in the pathological processes of CSM require further exploration. The present study hypothesized that ER homeostasis is essential for neuronal apoptosis in the CSM and that melatonin maintains this homeostasis. The results showed that ER stress led to neuronal apoptosis in rats with chronic cervical cord compression. Conversely, melatonin attenuates protein kinase R-like ER kinase-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha-C/EBP-homologous protein, inositol-requiring enzyme 1, and transcription factor 6 signaling pathways to release ER stress and prevents Bax translocation to the mitochondrion, thereby promoting motor recovery and protecting neurons in vivo. It also rescued primary rat cortical neurons from ER stress-induced glutamate toxicity in vitro. Moreover, melatonin remodels the ER morphology and restores homeostasis via ER-phagy in injured neurons. FAM134B, CCPG1, RTN3, and Sec. 62 are four known ER-phagy receptors. In this study, Sec. 62 was identified as a key melatonin factor in promoting ER-phagy and restoring ER homeostasis in damaged neurons in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, melatonin suppresses neuronal apoptosis by reducing ER stress and promoting ER-phagy to restore ER morphology and homeostasis. The current results suggested that melatonin is a promising treatment for CSM owing to its restorative effect on ER homeostasis; however, well-designed randomized controlled trials must be carried out to further investigate its clinical effects.

However, the molecular mechanism that triggers NED is unknown. Trigred motif 36 (TRIM36), a member of the TRIM protein family, exhibits oncogenic or anti-oncogenic roles in various cancers. We have previously reported that TRIM36 is highly expressed to inhibit the invasion and proliferation of PCa. In the present study, we first found that TRIM36 was lowly expressed in NEPC and its overexpression suppressed the NED of PCa. Next, based on proteomic analysis, we found that TRIM36 inhibited the glycolysis pathway through suppressing hexokinase 2 (HK2), a crucial glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. TRIM36 specifically bound to HK2 through lysine 48 (lys48)-mediated ubiquitination of HK2. Moreover, TRIM36-mediated ubiquitination degradation of HK2 downregulated the level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), a process that contributed to ferroptosis. In conclusion, TRIM36 can inhibit glycolysis via lys48-mediated HK2 ubiquitination to reduce GPX4 expression and activate ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting the NED in PCa. Targeting TRIM36 might be a promising approach to retard NED and treat NEPC.

It seems that adolescents are more susceptible to the effects of early-life stress; Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of chronic morphine consumption (21 days before and after mating and gestation) and MS (180 min/day from postnatal day [PND] 1-21) on the cognitive and behavioral performance of male offspring in mid-adolescence. Six groups, including control, MS, V (vehicle), morphine, V+MS, and morphine+MS, were tested for open field (OF), novel object recognition (NOR), and the Morris water maze (MWM). The results of the OF test showed that MS increased locomotor activity and movement velocity. Inner and outer zone durations did not differ among groups. The body stretching of the morphine+MS rats was significantly more than the MS rats. Moreover, the MS and morphine+MS groups showed significantly less sniffing behavior in the OF test. The MS group showed deficits in spatial learning in the MWM test, but recognition memory in the NOR and spatial memory in the MWM tests were not significantly different among groups. We concluded that MS could induce impairments in spatial learning and locomotor activity that could be worsened by maternal morphine exposure in adolescent male rats.

The aim of the study was to identify, if any, early inflammatory markers in the prognosis of all stages of primary cutaneous melanoma.Methods We conducted a 10-year cohort study among 2,141 melanoma patients from the same geographic area (Lazio) with primary cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2013. In situ cutaneous melanoma was excluded from the analysis (N = 288), leaving 1,853 cases of invasive cutaneous melanoma. The following hematological markers were obtained from clinical records: white blood cells count (WBC), count and percentages of neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and large unstained cells (LUC). Survival probability was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods, and prognostic factors were evaluated by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model).Results In the multivariate analysis, high levels of NLR (> 2.1 vs. <= 2.1, HR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.14-2.29, P = 0.007) and high levels of d-NLR (> 1.5 vs. <= 1.5, HR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.16-2.35, P = 0.005) were independently associated with an increased risk of 10-year melanoma mortality. However, when we stratified by Breslow thickness and clinical stage, we observed that NLR and d-NLR were good markers of prognosis only for patients with Breslow thickness of 2.0 mm and more (NLR, HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.04-2.50; d-NLR, HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.09-2.62) or clinical stage II-IV (NLR, HR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.01-2.37; d-NLR, HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.11-2.66), independent of other prognostic factors.Conclusion We suggest that a combination of NLR and Breslow thickness may be a useful, cheap, and readily available prognostic marker for cutaneous melanoma survival.

Starch is the major nutrient fraction in mung beans, wherein any physicochemical change in them while in germination as pre-processing tactics influences their properties and hence application broadness. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ultrasonic synergistic exogenous GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) treatment on to the physicochemical and functional properties of mung bean starch during germination. At 96 h of germination, the total starch content was decreased to 21.18% and the amylose and resistant starch contents were 48.29% and 64.39% respectively. The particle size, colour, and water-holding capacity of germinated mung bean starch were reduced significantly. As the increase in germination time continued, solubility, swelling and transparency increased and then decreased. The estimation of glycaemic index shows a minimum value of 22.52 at 12 h of germination. Combined treatment germination decreased the total starch content and increased the amylose and resistant starch content. The physicochemical properties of mung bean starch were significantly altered. Germination by ultrasound and exogenous GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) treatment modifies the functional properties of mung bean starch and provides a theoretical basis for its application in food.

MethodsTwo human HNSCC cell lines (Cal27, FaDu) received five different treatments: TTFields, RT +/- TTFields and RT + simultaneous cisplatin +/- TTFields. Effects were quantified using clonogenic assays and flow cytometric analyses of DAPI, caspase-3 activation and gamma H2AX foci. ResultsTreatment with RT + TTFields decreased the clonogenic survival as strong as treatment with RT + simultaneous cisplatin. The triple combination of RT + simultaneous cisplatin + TTFields even further decreased the clonogenic survival. Accordingly, combination of TTFields with RT or RT + simultaneous cisplatin increased cellular apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks. ConclusionTTFields therapy seems a promising combination partner in the multimodal treatment of locally advanced HNSCC. It could be used to intensify chemoradiotherapy or as alternative to chemotherapy.

Consequently, the bedrock exposure rate cannot be accurately estimated using the existing rock index method based on remote sensing and the fixed endmember mixed pixel decomposition model. In order to solve this problem, using LANDSAT operational land imager/thematic mapper (OLI/TM) images as the data source, this study estimated the bedrock exposure rate based on a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) considering spectral variability. In addition, this approach was compared with existing commonly used methods for estimating bedrock exposure rate. The results show that: (1) GLMM showed the highest performance in estimating bedrock exposure rate, with a total accuracy of 88.05% and a kappa coefficient of 0.845, and the accuracy exceeded 70% for different levels of bedrock exposure rate. However, the total accuracy of other commonly used bedrock exposure methods is was below 66%, being higher only in areas with bedrock exposure rates less than 20% and more than 70%. (2) By applying each method to different terrain scenes, GLMM was found to be more stable than other methods, and the estimated bedrock exposure rate is the closest to the ground reference value with a root mean square error less than 0.093. Other methods, including fully constrained least squares unmixing (FCLSU) and karst bare-rock index (KBRI), have a certain gap in different scenes, and their accuracy is not high. (3) Without any ground reference data, the accuracy of the direct unmixing result of GLMM is very close to that calculated by the regression model, and the accuracy difference among different grades of bedrock exposure rate is less than 5%, thus outperforming the other methods. GLMM can effectively estimate the bedrock exposure rate at different times using different data. Therefore, GLMM has great potential in extracting rocky desertification information in karst areas. It can also be a reference method for the rapid, accurate, and long-term evaluation of rocky desertification in karst areas.

Pain experienced in the preceding week was assessed using numeral rating scale (NRS). We performed a negative binomial regression analysis to assess pain in IIMs subtypes and whether demographics, disease activity, general health status, and physical function had an impact on pain scores.Results: Of 6988 participants included, 15.1% had IIMs, 27.9% had other AIRDs, and 57.0% were wAIDs. The median pain NRS in patients with IIMs, other AIRDs, and wAIDs were 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.0-5.0), 3.0 (IQR = 1.0-6.0), and 1.0 (IQR = 0-2.0), respectively (P < 0.001). Regression analysis adjusted for gender, age, and ethnicity revealed that overlap myositis and antisynthetase syndrome had the highest pain (NRS = 4.0, 95% CI = 3.5-4.5, and NRS = 3.6, 95% CI = 3.1-4.1, respectively). An additional association between pain and poor functional status was observed in all groups. Female gender was associated with higher pain scores in almost all scenarios. Increasing age was associated with higher pain NRS scores in some scenarios of disease activity, and Asian and Hispanic ethnicities had reduced pain scores in some functional status scenarios.Conclusion: Patients with IIMs reported higher pain levels than wAIDs, but less than patients with other AIRDs. Pain is a disabling manifestation of IIMs and is associated with a poor functional status.

Impact of the Standardized Interview Offer Date Initiatives: A Survey of Otolaryngology Applicants and Programs	OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY			English	Article						application; graduate medical education; interview; Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery; residency match	4TH YEAR; RESIDENCY APPLICATION; MEDICAL-SCHOOL; PERSPECTIVES	ObjectiveTo investigate residency applicant and program compliance with and attitudes toward a newly implemented standardized interview offer date program. Study designCross-sectional survey. SettingUS Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery training programs. MethodsAn electronic survey was distributed to applicants during match week in March 2022, and to program directors and program managers shortly after. The surveys included questions assessing program compliance with the standardized interview offer date as well as both applicant and program attitudes toward this newly implemented initiative. ResultsThis study achieved a 47% (263/559) response rate from applicants and 57% (68/120) from programs. Both applicants and program directors reported high program compliance with this initiative. Ninety-six percent of program directors reported complying with releasing interview offers on 1 standardized day. Applicants endorsed a reduction in their anxiety surrounding the residency application process as well as an increased ability to engage in the fourth year of medical school as benefits of the initiative. Providing clarity surrounding the applicant's final application status and further standardization of the interview scheduling process were identified as areas for improvement. ConclusionStandardization of residency interview offer and acceptance practices is both feasible and impactful. Providing applicants with a final applicant status and further efforts to improve the interview scheduling process may continue to bolster this initiative in future years.

This equation describes the laser pulse interaction with a semiconductor layer under laser-induced plasma generation. Because of its nonlinearity, the interaction process is very sensitive to the appearance of the optical beam spurious reflection; therefore, highly transparent ABCs are urgently required to avoid disturbing the interaction process by an unphysical reflected wave. This can be achieved by using time- and spatial-dependent local wavenumbers computed near the artificial boundaries. We claim that it is necessary to account for both wavenumbers in each of the adaptive ABCs stated on both spatial coordinates. Based on computer simulation, we demonstrate an increase in the efficiency of the adaptive ABC stated on the coordinate along which the optical pulse propagates by involving both local wavenumbers. The accuracy of the developed approach is verified using a well-known analytical solution of the linear Schrodinger equation as well as the reference problem solution, obtained by solving the problem with zero-value boundary conditions on the extended spatial domain. For computer modeling, the finite-difference scheme, possessing asymptotic stability, is applied together with a two-stage iterative process for its realization. The algorithm and peculiarities of the local wavenumber computation are discussed in detail. The applicability of the developed approach is also demonstrated via the solution of both linear and nonlinear problems. The proposed method has widespread application for solving various laser physics problems governed by the Schrodinger equation.

Consensus recommendations on the management of hepatitis C in Australia's prisons	MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article						Hepatitis C; Prison; Substance abuse; intravenous	VIRUS-INFECTION; INTERVENTIONS; PREVENTION; PEOPLE; CARE	IntroductionPrison settings represent the highest concentration of prevalent hepatitis C cases in Australia due to the high rates of incarceration among people who inject drugs. Highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are available to people incarcerated in Australian prisons. However, multiple challenges to health care implementation in the prison sector present barriers to people in prison reliably accessing hepatitis C testing, treatment, and prevention measures. Main recommendationsThis Consensus statement highlights important considerations for the management of hepatitis C in Australian prisons. High coverage testing, scale-up of streamlined DAA treatment pathways, improved coverage of opioid agonist therapy, and implementation and evaluation of regulated provision of prison needle and syringe programs to reduce HCV infection and reinfection are needed. Changes in management as a result of this statementThe recommendations set current best practice standards in hepatitis C diagnosis, treatment and prevention in the Australian prison sector based on available evidence. Prison-based health services should strive to simplify and improve efficiency in the provision of the hepatitis C care cascade, including strategies such as universal opt-out testing, point-of-care testing, simplified assessment protocols, and earlier confirmation of cure. Optimising hepatitis C management in prisons is essential to prevent long term adverse outcomes for a marginalised population living with HCV. Scale-up of testing and treatment in prisons will make a major contribution towards Australia's efforts to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030.

To demonstrate the diagnostic performance of ultrasound for fistula-in-ano, a definite diagnosis of perianal abscess, and fistula-in-ano was determined as that proven through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). The absence or presence of perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano on ultrasonography was recorded.Results: Among the 45 patients, on ultrasound, perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano were detected in 22 (48.9%) and 30 (68.2%) patients, respectively. Nine patients had MRI or CT and a definite diagnosis of perianal abscess or fistula-in-ano; accuracy, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of ultrasound for perianal abscess were 77.8% (7/9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.0%-97.1%), 66.7% (2/3; 95% CI: 9.4%-99.2%), 83.3% (5/6; 95% CI: 35.9%-99.6%), and those of fistula-in-ano were 100% (9/9; 95% CI: 66.4%-100%), 100% (8/8; 95% CI: 63.1%-100%), and 100% (1/1; 95% CI: 2.5%-100%), respectively.Conclusions: Perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano were detected by ultrasound in half of the patients with perianal inflammation. Accordingly, ultrasound has an acceptable diagnostic performance for perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano.

Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt-quantum-dot-modified sulfur-doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S-NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S-NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71 mV and long-term stability of 200 h at 100 mA cm(-2), exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65 degrees C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S-NiFe LDH needs just 1.62 V to reach the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO2. This work provides rational ideas to develop electrocatalysts with exceptional performance for industrial high-temperature water splitting at high current densities.

The authors here demonstrate that when slot-die coating the halide perovskite layers on large areas, ribbing effects may occur but can be prevented by adjusting the precursor ink's rheological properties. For formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI(3)) precursor inks based on 2-methoxyethanol, the ink viscosity is adjusted by adding acetonitrile (ACN) as a co-solvent leading to smooth FAPbI(3) thin-films with high quality and layer homogeneity. For an optimized content of 46 vol% of the ACN co-solvent, a certified steady-state performance of 22.3% is achieved in p-i-n FAPbI(3)-perovskite solar cells. Scaling devices to larger areas by making laser series-interconnected mini-modules of 12.7 cm(2), a power conversion efficiency of 17.1% is demonstrated. A full year of outdoor stability testing with continuous maximum power point tracking on encapsulated devices is performed and it is demonstrated that these devices maintain close to 100% of their initial performance during winter and spring followed by a significant performance decline during warmer summer months. This work highlights the importance of the real-condition evaluation of larger area device prototypes to validate the technological potential of halide perovskite photovoltaics.

Understanding crop colonization of oilseed rape crops by the cabbage stem flea beetle (<i>Psylliodes chrysocephala</i> L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae))	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						colonization process; locomotor activity; sex ratio; sexual maturity; meteorological factors; monitoring	XYLOSTELLA L LEPIDOPTERA; BRASSICA-NAPUS-L; POLLEN BEETLE; PLUTELLA-XYLOSTELLA; MELIGETHES-AENEUS; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; TEMPERATURE; SYSTEM; PARASITOIDS; POPULATION	BACKGROUNDDevelopment of accurate pest monitoring systems is essential for the establishment of integrated pest management strategies. Information about the pest behavior during the colonization process, as well as the sex and reproductive status of the colonizing population often are lacking and hinder their development. The cabbage stem flea beetle (CSFB, Psylliodes chrysocephala) can cause the complete destruction of oilseed rape crops (OSR, Brassica napus). In the present study, the colonization process of OSR fields by the CSFB was studied. RESULTSMore individuals were caught on the outward facing side of the traps than the side of the trap facing towards the crop at the field border and catches were higher on the trapping units at the center of the field than at its border, suggesting that more beetles were entering than leaving the crop. Catches were higher on lower traps placed near to the crop than on those positioned further from the ground and also were higher during the day than late afternoon and night. The sex-ratio of individuals caught was skewed towards males and sexual maturity was acquired for females during the experiment. Integration of sampling data with local meteorological data showed that the catches correlated mostly with air temperature and relative humidity. CONCLUSIONThis study provides new information about the dispersion of the CSFB in OSR fields during the colonization process, and highlights correlations between local meteorological factors and activity of the CSFB, and represent a new step towards implementing monitoring strategies against this pest.

Its nutritional and economic importance has extended the cultivation to other countries with suitable environmental conditions. Despite the large expansion in date palm cultivation and the associated improvement in its yield and quality over the last few decades, challenges remain in its cultivation and sustainability. Here, we review: (1) the current status of date palm cultivation, (2) the key environmental and soil-related factors influencing its cultivation and productivity, and (3) the challenges under global change in addition to assessing the future potentials for improvements and sustainability. The global production of date palm has increased by 18% during the last ten years, reaching 8.53 million tons, on a total area of 1.11 million ha. Water scarcity and salinity stresses are the major constraints affecting date palm productivity, which is a serious issue in arid regions, where water resources are becoming depleted and soil is becoming increasingly salinized due to limited rainfall, high evapotranspiration, and incorrect irrigation. Although date palm can tolerate salinity up to 12 dS m(-1), accumulation of salts in soil strongly reduces the yield. The main cultivation areas are dominated by soils of sandy texture with high pH and a low capacity for water and nutrient retention. Organic fertilizers increase water and nutrient retention. There is a lack of long-term studies (e.g., >= 10 years) designed to monitor date palm cultivar responses to abiotic stresses as well as to nutrition and management practices. Future challenges facing date palm cultivation mainly include water shortages, extremely high temperatures, salinity, and soil degradation, as well as diseases and pests. The implementation of efficient management practices, including modern irrigation systems, selecting cultivars most suitable for the local environmental conditions, and increasing soil water and nutrient retention, help to sustain date palm cultivation and productivity.

We previously found in jackdaws Corvus monedula that larger eggs resulted in larger nestlings up to fledging. Through a cross-foster experiment of complete clutches we tested whether this association can be attributed to egg size per se, or to more proficient parents producing larger eggs and larger nestlings, with the latter effect being more or less independent of egg size. Due to other manipulations post-hatching, we primarily investigated effects on nestling mass on day 5, which we show to predict survival until fledging. We introduce a new statistical approach to compare the competing hypotheses and discuss the multiple advantages of this approach over current practice of which we report the results for comparison. We conclude that 92% of the slope of the association between egg size and nestling mass can be attributed to a direct effect of egg size. The remaining 8% of the slope can be attributed to aspects of parental chick rearing ability as reflected in egg size, but this component did not deviate significantly from zero. Intriguingly, the effect of egg size on day 5 nestling mass was steeper (1.7 g cm(-3)) than the effect of egg size on day 1 hatchling mass (0.7 g cm(-3)). Early growth is exponential, and the difference in effect size may therefore be explained by hatchlings from large eggs being further in their development at hatching. The direct effect of egg size on nestling mass raises the question what causes egg size variation in jackdaws.

However, a measure of similarity is difficult to determine when it comes to complex stimuli such as faces. Indeed, people may notice someone "looks like" a familiar face, but find it hard to describe on the basis of what features such a comparison is based. Previous work shows that the number of similar visual elements between a face pictogram and a memorized target correlates with the P300 amplitude in the visual evoked potential. Here, we redefine similarity as the distance inferred from a latent space learned using a state-of-the-art generative adversarial neural network (GAN). A rapid serial visual presentation experiment was conducted with oddball images generated at varying distances from the target to determine how P300 amplitude related to GAN-derived distances. The results showed that distance-to-target was monotonically related to the P300, showing perceptual identification was associated with smooth, drifting image similarity. Furthermore, regression modeling indicated that while the P3a and P3b sub-components had distinct responses in location, time, and amplitude, they were similarly related to target distance. The work demonstrates that the P300 indexes the distance between perceived and target image in smooth, natural, and complex visual stimuli and shows that GANs present a novel modeling methodology for studying the relationships between stimuli, perception, and recognition.

Clinical ConsiderationsComprehensive complete-mouth rehabilitations in elderly patients with adaptation of the occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) often present particular challenges. This applies especially when exacting functional and esthetic requirements are to be met and the treatment should not cause the patient too much effort, still ensuring the highest level of quality and efficiency and a low intervention rate. ConclusionThe digital approach used for the present patient allowed for an efficient treatment procedure, facilitated virtual evaluations using a face-scan, and enhanced the predictability of the prosthodontic outcome. The approach enabled some steps required in the conventional protocol to be omitted, resulting in a straightforward clinical treatment with minimal strain on the patient. Clinical SignificanceBecause of the comprehensive recording of extraoral and intraoral data, for example with a facial scanner, it was possible to transfer a digital replica of the patient to the dental laboratory technician. With this protocol, many steps can be performed in the absence of the real patient.

J	Gong, HY; Li, YG; Dong, J				Gong, Huiyun; Li, Yeguang; Dong, Jian			A dual-balanced network for long-tail distribution object detection	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article						computer vision; learning (artificial intelligence); object detection	SMOTE	Object detection on datasets with imbalanced distributions (i.e. long-tail distributions) dataset is a significantly challenging task. Some re-balancing solutions, such as re-weighting and re-sampling have two main disadvantages. First, re-balancing strategies only utilise a coarse-grained global threshold to suppress some of the most influential categories, while overlooking locally influential categories. Second, very few studies have specifically designed algorithms for object detection tasks under long-tail distribution. To address these two issues, a dual-balanced network for fine-grained re-balancing object detection is proposed. Our re-balancing strategies are both in proposal and classification logic, corresponding to two sub-networks, the Balance Region Proposal Network (BRPN) and the Balance Classification Network (BCN). The BRPN sub-network equalises the number of proposals in the background and foreground by reducing the sampling probability of simple backgrounds, and the BCN sub-network equalises the logic between head and tail categories by globally suppressing negative gradients and locally fixing the over-suppressed negative gradients. In addition, the authors advise a balance binary cross entropy loss to jointly re-balance the entire network. This design can be generalised to different two-stage object detection frameworks. The experimental mAP result of 26.40% on this LVIS-v0.5 dataset outperforms most SOTA methods.

J	Güok, NG				Gurok, Nese Gocer			The correlation between ABO blood types and acne vulgaris severity	JOURNAL OF COSMETIC DERMATOLOGY			English	Article						ABO; acne severity; acne vulgaris		BackgroundAcne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease with multifactorial etiology. Studies on the pathogenesis of acne are still important. Recently, various studies have been conducted on the significance of genetics in the pathogenesis of acne. Blood group is transferred genetically and could affect the development, progress, and severity of certain diseases. AimIn the current study, the correlation between the severity of acne vulgaris and ABO blood groups was investigated. Materials and MethodsA total of 380 patients (263 mild and 117 severe acne vulgaris patients) and 1000 healthy individuals were included in the study. Severity of acne vulgaris patients and healthy controls was determined based on the blood group and Rh factor data obtained retrospectively from the patient files in the hospital automation system. ResultsIn the study, the rate of females was significantly higher in the acne vulgaris group (X-2:154.908; p:0.000). The mean age of the patient was significantly lower when compared to the controls (t:37.127; p:0.0001). The mean age of the patients with severe acne was significantly lower when compared to those with mild acne. When compared to the control group, the incidence of severe acne was higher in those A blood type when compared to the patients with mild acne, while the incidence of mild acne was higher in other blood groups when compared to the control (X-2:17.756; p:0.007). No significant difference was determined between the Rh blood groups of the patients with mild, severe acne and the control group (X-2:0.812; p:0.666). ConclusionThe results revealed a significant correlation between acne severity and ABO blood groups. Future studies that would be conducted with larger samples in different centers could confirm the current study findings.

Functional estrogen receptor signal transduction pathway activity and antihormonal therapy response in low-grade ovarian carcinoma	CANCER			English	Article						antihormonal therapy; immunohistochemistry; ovarian carcinoma; signal transduction pathway; survival; targeted therapy	CANCER; EXPRESSION; WOMEN	BackgroundAdvanced low-grade ovarian carcinoma (LGOC) is difficult to treat. In several studies, high estrogen receptor (ER) protein expression was observed in patients with LGOC, which suggests that antihormonal therapy (AHT) is a treatment option. However, only a subgroup of patients respond to AHT, and this response cannot be adequately predicted by currently used immunohistochemistry (IHC). A possible explanation is that IHC only takes the ligand, but not the activity, of the whole signal transduction pathway (STP) into account. Therefore, in this study, the authors assessed whether functional STP activity can be an alternative tool to predict response to AHT in LGOC. MethodsTumor tissue samples were obtained from patients with primary or recurrent LGOC who subsequently received AHT. Histoscores of ER and progesterone receptor (PR) were determined. In addition, STP activity of the ER STP and of six other STPs known to play a role in ovarian cancer was assessed and compared with the STP activity of healthy postmenopausal fallopian tube epithelium. ResultsPatients who had normal ER STP activity had a progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.1 months. This was significantly shorter in patients who had low and very high ER STP activity, with a median PFS of 6.0 and 2.1 months, respectively (p < .001). Unlike ER histoscores, PR histoscores were strongly correlated to the ER STP activity and thus to PFS. ConclusionsAberrant low and very high functional ER STP activity and low PR histoscores in patients with LGOC indicate decreased response to AHT. ER IHC is not representative of functional ER STP activity and is not related to PFS.	[Hendrikse, Cynthia S. E.; van der Ploeg, Phyllis; van de Kruis, Nienke M. A.; Wilting, Jody H.

We found no evidence of ICBF following low energy collision-induced dissociation (in correspondence with previous works), however, we do observe clear evidence for ICBF following photon absorption in the 4.6-14 eV range. Moreover, the comparison of photon-induced dissociation measurements of the protonated serine dimer to those of a protonated serine dipeptide provides evidence that ICBF, in this case, involves peptide bond formation (PBF). The experimental results are supported by ab initio molecular dynamics and exploration of several excited state potential energy surfaces, unraveling a pathway for PBF following photon absorption. The combination of experiments and theory provides insight into the PBF mechanisms in clusters of amino acids, and reveals the importance of electronic excited states reached upon UV/VUV light excitation.

The discovery of new materials with desirable properties has historically been conducted either using an experimental or a first-principles density functional theory based study. These approaches are extremely time-intensive, and therefore, cannot be applied effectively to study a large number of systems. In such situations, machine learning can be used to make predictions about properties of new compounds from known data, providing a more efficient route to materials discovery. Here, this approach is used to predict the bandgap of a series of oxysulfide perovskites (of the form of ABO(X)S(3-X), X = 0,1,2,3), in general, and sulfur-rich ABOS(2), in particular. Atomic properties of constituent elements in the perovskite structures via 1.048 millions possible subsets of features are employed to train the models. Further, feature selection, kernel ridge regression, and k-nearest neighbors classification methods are applied to downselect the promising ABOS(2) based oxysulfide perovskites for water-splitting. The accuracy of each model is determined using standard statistical metrics. Finally, seven stable but yet unsynthesized sulfur-rich oxysulfide perovskites (BiInOS2, BiGaOS2, SbInOS2, SbGaOS2, SbAlOS2, SnZrOS2, and MgSnOS2) that show potential for water-splitting applications are proposed.

Growing "detector-grade" HPGe single crystals, with tailored structural defects and controlled impurity content, uniform throughout the crystal is a challenging task in this type of crystalline semiconductor material. All different process steps for HPGe, namely, i) reducing germanium dioxide powder into Ge metal; ii) zone refining of intrinsic source material (6 N) up to an ultrahigh purity (13 N); iii) Czochralski growth of high-purity single crystals, are developed in house. A specific preparatory coating process for zone refining is entrenched as part of this work. Gallium, a dominant impurity usually found in HPGe, can be avoided. Using these advanced process know-hows, a technology to grow volume Ge single crystals of large diameter (3 in.) with very high purity (net carrier concentration approximate to 5 x 10(10) cm(-3) or equivalent to 1 part per trillion level) is successfully developed. The zone-refined Ge bars and the crystals show p-type conductivity. Some crystals exhibit n-type conductivity, and n-p or p-n transition is encountered in a single growth experiment. Besides the first results of encompassing very high-purity crystals with uniform diameter, a controlled dislocation density (approximate to 10(4) cm(-2)) can be realized.

A portion of oxygen in the steel dissolves in sulfide to form oxysulfide, Mn(S,O), which can be single-particle spherelike (SPS), double-particle rodlike (DPR), and multi-particle rodlike (MPR), and SiO2 can precipitate at the outer edge of the SPS and connection in the DPR and MPR inclusion particles to form Mn(S,O)-SiO2 inclusion, which is formed by the change of liquid inclusion, that undergoes monotectic reaction to form oxides and oxysulfide. The possible phase-transition process can be expressed as (Mn,Si)(x)(S,O)(y)(l) -> Mn(S,O)(l -> s) + (Mn,Si)(x)O-y(s) -> Mn(S,O)(s) + SiO2(s). Oxysulfide inclusions can aggregate under the influence of van der Waals and viscous drag forces. The larger the particle, the greater the critical spacing and aggregation force. MPR oxysulfide can be divided into three parts: droplet, flat surface, and neck, which have decreasing chemical potentials in turn. Sintering and densification occur after the aggregation of particles, where surface diffusion of elements dominates, while grain boundary diffusion and bulk diffusion dominate in the densification of particles. Meanwhile, the formation and evolution of five different morphologies of sulfides in 1215MS free-cutting steels are discussed.

The Wagner model combined with coexistence theory is applied to calculate the Gibbs free energy of the steel-inclusion system. The composition evolution of inclusions is accurately predicted through the current thermodynamic model which is widely applied to predict the modification of inclusions by the calcium treatment process with different contents of total oxygen (T.O), total sulfur (T.S), and total calcium (T.Ca) in the molten steel. Alumina inclusions can be modified to liquid calcium aluminate inclusions with appropriate T.Ca contents. Solid CaS or CaO inclusions can be formed as a result of the excessive calcium addition to molten steel, while the insufficient calcium addition can hardly modify alumina inclusions to liquid ones. The effect of the T.O and T.S contents on the liquid window is also discussed. The relationship between the value of T.S/T.O in the molten steel and the composition of inclusions is also studied. Based on the established thermodynamic model, a software for the precise control of inclusions is also developed to guide the calcium treatment operation timely in the accrual refining process.

Method of studyIn this study, we used RNA sequencing to characterize the mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood. Thereafter, enrichment analysis was performed to determine the functions of the differentially expressed genes, and Cytoscape was used to construct lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks. ResultsOur results showed that the peripheral blood of patients with URSA has distinct mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles, with a total of 359 mRNAs and 683 lncRNAs being differentially expressed. Moreover, the top hub genes, including IGF1, PPARG, CCL3, RETN, SERPINE1, HESX1, and PRL, were identified and further validated using real-time quantitative PCR. Furthermore, we demonstrated a lncRNA-mRNA interaction network that achieved 12 key lncRNAs and their targeted mRNAs are involved in systemic lupus erythematosus, allograft rejection, and complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, the correlation between immune cell subtypes and IGF1 expression was evaluated; a negative correlation was observed with the proportion of natural killer cells, which increased significantly in URSA. ConclusionWe identified seven top hub genes, constructed a lncRNA-related network and suggested that IGF1 plays a key role in regulating maternal immune response by affecting NK and T cells' function, which helps to identify the pathogenesis of URSA.

This study assessed the flour produced from blanched crickets treated with extracts of either ginger, garlic or both at a ratio of 1:4 (v/w) for color, pH, microbiological profile, sensory quality, and acceptability. Sodium benzoate treated and untreated cricket flour was used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The flour was stored at ambient conditions and analyzed on 0, 30, and 60 days of storage. The pH, moisture content and color change increased during storage but remained within acceptable limits. The total microbial count, yeast and molds significantly decreased with storage duration (p < .05), while fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were not detected in any of the samples. At the end of the 60-day storage period, cricket flour treated with sodium benzoate and garlic extracts both had a significantly lowest population of yeast and molds (1.91 log cfu/g). On five point hedonic scale (1. Dislike extremely and 5. Like extremely), color (3.84 +/- 0.86-2.55 +/- 0.99), aroma (3.59 +/- 1.09-2.40 +/- 1.01), texture (4.11 +/- 0.97-3.11 +/- 0.97) and overall acceptability (3.77 +/- 0.64-2.83 +/- 1.01) sensory scores were all significantly high on day 0 and low on day 60 of storage, respectively. The study concluded that preserving crickets with garlic extracts significantly reduced the population of yeast and molds. Cricket flours were microbiologically safe and acceptable to consumers. Therefore, storage of cricket flour preserved with garlic and ginger extracts for longer periods is recommended. In addition, utilization of the preserved flour as an ingredient in different food applications is recommended to determine its suitability and sensory acceptability.

J	Arruti, OA; Virtuani, A; Ballif, C				Arruti, Olatz Arriaga; Virtuani, Alessandro; Ballif, Christophe			Long-term performance and reliability of silicon heterojunction solar modules	PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Review						degradation; performance; PLR; reliability; silicon heterojunction	POTENTIAL-INDUCED DEGRADATION; PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES; LESSONS LEARNT; CELLS; EFFICIENCY; SAFETY; PLANT; RATES	The high-efficiency silicon heterojunction (SHJ) technology is now perceived mature enough to enter the Giga-Watt manufacturing scale with several players around the globe. The growth of the SHJ technology requires confidence from manufacturers, investors, and system developers about its reliability and long-term performance. In this work, we perform a literature survey collecting performance data (and performance loss rates [PLRs]) published for SHJ modules. Publications on this specific subject are still limited; however, enough available data exist to drive some preliminary conclusions. Despite a long list of caveats specific to this type of meta-analysis, when considering all published datasets, we obtain for SHJ modules median and average PLR values of 0.56%/year and 0.70%/year, respectively. These numbers are in line with PLR generally reported for field-deployed crystalline silicon (c-Si modules). We then apply a filtering procedure to distinguish what we perceive to be high-accuracy datasets from less accurate ones. This methodology is understandably arbitrary, but it helps increasing the robustness of the present analysis. Our refined analysis leads us to slightly higher PLR for SHJ modules: 0.80%/year and 0.83%/year for median and average values, respectively. These values fall between previously reported PLR of c-Si and thin-film modules. Additionally, we observe some mild correlations between the PLRs and the climatic conditions of the installation sites, even if we need to stress that for each climate, we find a large variability, including a PLR value as low as 0.29%/year. We complement the survey with information about the main failure modes reported in the literature for this technology and an analysis of the limits and caveats for this type of study. The most significant one is that the reported numbers refer-for the vast majority-to modules from just one manufacturer (i.e., the first company manufacturing and commercializing the SHJ technology). We finally point out that a deep understanding of the potential weaknesses of the technology-collected over the years-has led to several improvements in terms of reliability. A careful material choice and module design may in fact allow the SHJ technology targeting extended service lifetimes of 35+ years.

Benchmarking quality of care using patient reported outcome measure data for patients presenting with musculoskeletal conditions in primary care GP practices	MUSCULOSKELETAL CARE			English	Article						musculoskeletal; outcome measures; primary health care	CLINICAL-PRACTICE	Background: Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) evaluate health status from a patient perspective. They can be used to support care at a patient level but also collectively to review quality of care across care providers. Vast amounts of patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions present to General Practice (GP) primary care practitioners each year. Variation in patient outcomes in this setting however has not been reported.Objective: To identify variation in patient outcomes measured using the musculoskeletal health questionnaire (MSK-HQ) PROM for adults presenting to 20 GP practices in the UK with MSK conditions.Methods: A secondary analysis of the STarT MSK cluster randomised controlled trial dataset. A standardised case-mix adjustment model, adjusting for condition complexity co-variates, was used to calculate predicted 6-month follow-up MSK-HQ scores, and used to compare adjusted and un-adjusted health gain (n = 868). Patient MSK-HQ change outcomes were aggregated to practice level and boxplots used to display outlier GP practices for un-adjusted and adjusted outcomes.Results: Substantial variation in patient outcomes was seen across the 20 practices, even after case-mix adjustment, with mean change in MSK-HQ scores ranging from 6 to 12 points. Boxplots displaying un-adjusted outcomes showed one negative GP practice outlier and two positive outliers. However, the boxplots displaying case-mix adjusted outcomes showed no negative outliers, with two practices remaining as positive outliers, and one practice additionally becoming a positive outlier.Conclusion: This study showed a two-fold GP practice variation in patient outcomes measured using the MSK-HQ PROM. To our knowledge it is the first study to demonstrate that (a) a standardised case-mix adjustment method can be used to fairly compare patient health outcome variation in GP care, and (b) that case-mix adjustment changes benchmarking findings with regards to provider performance and outlier identification. This has important implications for identifying best practice exemplars and thereby helping to improve the quality of MSK primary care in the future.

From a synthetic point of view, the construction of such kinds of unequal and integrated systems without the help of proteinaceous scaffolding is challenging. Here, we show that four octatetrayne-bridged ortho-perylene diimide (PDI) dyads (POPs) self-assemble into a quadruple assembly (POP)(4) both in solution and in the solid state. The two identical PDI units in each POP are compartmentalized into weakly coupled PDIs (P520) and closely stacked PDIs (P550) in (POP)(4). The two extreme pools of PDI chromophores were unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. To interpret the formation of the discrete quadruple assembly, we also developed a two-step cooperative model. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate the existence of multiple couplings within and across P520 and P550, which can satisfactorily describe the photophysical properties of the unequal quadruple assembly(.) This finding is expected to help advance the rational design of dye stacks to emulate functions of natural LH systems.

However, its tissue distribution, a vital part of the efficacy substances research, has not been reported yet. This study characterized its chemical components and its prototypes and metabolites in mice, and investigated its tissue distribution in pathological and healthy mice. Several constituents were characterized, including 55 constituents in JZOL, 11 absorbed prototypes and six metabolites in plasma and tissues. The metabolic pathways were demethylation, dehydration and acetylation. A sensitive, accurate and stable quantitative method was established and applied to the tissue distribution. After administration of JZOL, these seven components were rapidly distributed to various tissues, mainly staying in the small intestine, and less distributed to lung, liver and kidney. Compared with healthy mice, the absorption of baicalin, wogonoside, rhein, glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin apioside was reduced in influenza mice, but their elimination was slow. However, influenza infection had no obvious effect on the overall distribution of the most important components (baicalin, glycyrrhizic acid and wogonoside) in the plasma or small intestine, but obviously affected the distribution of baicalin in liver. In summary, seven components are rapidly distributed to various tissues, and influenza infection has certain influence on the tissue distribution of JZOL.

Associations between positive memory count and hazardous substance use in a trauma-exposed sample: Examining the moderating role of emotion dysregulation	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						hazardous substance use; negative emotion dysregulation; positive emotion dysregulation; positive memory count; trauma	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; SELF-DEFINING MEMORIES; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDERS; OVERGENERAL AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; INITIAL VALIDATION; HEAVY DRINKING; MISSING DATA; RASH ACTION; DRUG-USE; MOOD	ObjectivesResearch has demonstrated links between autobiographical memory retrieval and hazardous substance use. However, limited work has examined relations between positive autobiographical memories and hazardous substance use, as well as moderating factors influencing these relations. Thus, we examined the potential moderating roles of negative and positive emotion dysregulation in the relations between count of retrieved positive memories and hazardous substance use (alcohol and drug use separately). MethodsParticipants were 333 trauma-exposed students (M-age = 21.05; 85.9% women) who completed self-report measures assessing positive memory count, hazardous alcohol and drug use, negative emotion dysregulation, and positive emotion dysregulation. ResultsPositive emotion dysregulation significantly moderated the association between positive memory count and hazardous alcohol use (b = 0.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.01, 0.06], p = 0.019), as well as the association between positive memory count and hazardous drug use (b = 0.02, 95% CI [0.01, 0.03], p = 0.002). Individuals with more positive emotion dysregulation had stronger associations between increases in positive memory count and increased hazardous substance use. ConclusionFindings indicate that trauma-exposed individuals who retrieve more positive memories and experience difficulties regulating positive emotions report greater hazardous substance use. Positive emotion dysregulation may be an important target for memory-based interventions among trauma-exposed individuals who report hazardous substance use.

Herein, this technique is limited to specimens about 10 mu m thick, such that applications of soft X-ray tomography of large human cells or multicellular specimens are not possible. A theoretical and experimental framework for soft X-ray tomography that enables extension of imaging volumes to 18 mu m-thick specimens is developed. This approach, based on long depth of field and half-acquisition tomography, is easily applicable to microscopes equipped with a full-rotation specimen stage. This opens opportunities for imaging large human cells, such as those commonly seen in cancer research, as well as cell-to-cell interactions, where two or more cells occupy the same imaging volume.

Philosophical reflection on this topic is especially scarce. This article proposes a novel account of vividness arguing that its standard operationalisation in psychology conflates two major modality-general dimensions along which experiences vary-subjective intensity and subjective specificity-which themselves are determined by further modality-specific factors. The article identifies the neural underpinnings of these factors in the visual domain, demonstrates the unificatory power of the account, and argues that vividness is part of the content of perception.

How prenatal cortisol levels relate to grandmother-mother relationships among a cohort of Latina women	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article							POSTNATAL DEPRESSION SCALE; PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT; PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; MATERNAL CORTISOL; MENTAL-HEALTH; MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALE; BIRTH OUTCOMES; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PERINATAL DEPRESSION; NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY	IntroductionAs part of the human reproductive strategy, mothers receive childcare assistance from others. For kin, allomothers are adaptively incentivized to provide assistance due to inclusive fitness benefits. Previous studies across a broad range of populations identify grandmothers as particularly consistent allomothers. Minimal attention has been paid to the possibility that allomothers may begin investing in offspring quality during the prenatal stage of life. Here, we innovate within the area of grandmother allocare research by examining the prenatal stage of life and biopsychosocial mechanisms by which prenatal grandmother effects may be enacted. MethodsData derive from the Mothers' Cultural Experiences study, a cohort of 107 pregnant Latina women in Southern California. At <16 weeks' gestation, we administered questionnaires, collected morning urine samples, and measured cortisol by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, correcting for specific gravity. We measured the soon-to-be maternal and paternal grandmothers' relationship quality, social support, frequency of seeing each other, communicating, and geographic proximity to pregnant mothers, that is, their daughters and daughters-in-law. These measures were self-reported by the pregnant mothers. We assessed how grandmother constructs related to the pregnant women's depression, stress, anxiety, and cortisol levels. ResultsWe observed benefits conferred by maternal grandmothers for mothers' prenatal mental health and lower cortisol levels. Paternal grandmothers also conferred mental health benefits to pregnant daughters-in-law, but higher cortisol levels. ConclusionOur results suggest that grandmothers, especially maternal grandmothers, are able to improve their inclusive fitness by caring for pregnant daughters, and allomother support may positively impact prenatal health. This work extends the traditional cooperative breeding model by identifying a prenatal grandmother effect, and, by examining a maternal biomarker.	[Fox, Molly M. M.; Knorr, Delaney A.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						disinfection; matrix; treatment; efficiency; interferences; SR-AOPs		This perspective article primarily discusses the role of water matrix for the advanced treatment of watercourses. This relies on experimental work regarding the inactivation of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus by an advanced oxidation process, namely activated persulfate, in five matrices of varying complexity, (i.e., from as simple as deionized water to secondary treated effluent). For comparison purposes, respective tests were performed with ultraviolet (UVC) radiation, a conventional disinfection process, while results from recent literature are also discussed. Only in deionized water can activated persulfate (i.e., 150 mg L-1 sodium persulfate and 30 mg L-1 ferrous ions) completely inactivate all three bacteria in the course of several minutes, but the process is ineffective in other matrices (i.e., bottled, tap, or lake water, as well as wastewater), where 1-2 orders of magnitude longer times are needed for partial inactivation, which decreases in the order E. coli > E. faecalis similar to V. parahaemolyticus. Conversely, UVC (at 30 W nominal value) is highly efficient against all bacteria and in all matrices in a matter of just a few seconds. The general perception is that treatment efficiency decreases with increasing matrix complexity in terms of total concentration and/or individual components composition, irrespective of the applied treatment method and its objectives (i.e., disinfection, decontamination, or mineralization). However, there are always exceptions the rule, further highlighting how case-specific advanced water treatment can be. The matrix itself should be given particular emphasis for the rational design of efficient water treatment processes. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

We utilize the de Sitter Legendrian Frenet frames to provide parametric representations of (contra)pedal curves of spacelike and timelike frontals in the de Sitter 2-space and to investigate the geometric and singularity properties of these (contra)pedal curves. We then introduce orthotomics of frontals in the de Sitter 2-space and explain these orthotomics as wavefronts from the viewpoint of Legendrian singularity theory. Furthermore, we generalize these methods to study antiorthotomics of frontals in the de Sitter 2-space.	[Li, Yanlin] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Sch Math, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Tuncer, O.

Evaluation of the effect of ritlecitinib on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in healthy participants	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						caffeine; drug interaction; pharmacokinetics; ritlecitinib	ALOPECIA-AREATA; CONCISE GUIDE; INHIBITORS; CYP1A2	AimsThis clinical study was conducted to evaluate the impact of ritlecitinib on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, a cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrate. MethodsIn this single-centre, single-arm, open-label, fixed-sequence study, healthy participants received a single 100-mg dose of caffeine on 2 separate occasions: on Day 1 of Period 1 as monotherapy and on Day 8 of Period 2 after oral administration of ritlecitinib 200 mg once daily for 8 days. Serial blood samples were collected and analysed using a validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by using a noncompartmental method. Safety was monitored by physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiograms and laboratory assessments. ResultsTwelve participants were enrolled and completed the study. Coadministration of caffeine 100 mg in the presence of steady-state levels of ritlecitinib (200 mg once daily) increased caffeine exposure compared with caffeine given alone. Area under the curve to infinity and maximum concentration of caffeine increased by approximately 165 and 10%, respectively, when coadministered with ritlecitinib. The ratios of the adjusted geometric means (90% confidence interval) for caffeine area under the curve to infinity and maximum concentration were 265.14% (234.12-300.26%) and 109.74% (103.90-15.91%), respectively, when caffeine was coadministered with steady-state ritlecitinib (test) compared with its administration alone (reference). Multiple doses of ritlecitinib when coadministered with a single dose of caffeine were generally safe and well tolerated in healthy participants. ConclusionRitlecitinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2 and can increase systemic exposures of CYP1A2 substrates.

ObjectiveTo investigate the health information-seeking behaviour and information sources and their roles in decision making among breast cancer patients in Romania in the context of the surgical treatment. MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 patients who were treated surgically for breast cancer at the Bucharest Oncology Institute. ResultsMost participants searched for information independently, before and after the operation, and their information needs evolved during the progression of their disease. The surgeon was regarded as the most trusted source of information. Most patients adopted a paternalistic or a shared approach for decision making. DiscussionBesides findings consistent with research from other countries, our study also revealed findings in contrast to previous research. None of the interviewed patients made any reference to the library as a source of information even if books were mentioned. ConclusionsHealth information specialists should develop a detailed guide and online information services to help physicians and other health professionals to provide relevant and reliable health care information to surgical inpatients from Romania.

J	Mohmand, SK; Anderson, C				Mohmand, Shandana Khan; Anderson, Colin			Researching governance in difficult times and places: Reflections from Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, and Pakistan	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						civic space; conflict and violence; fragility; qualitative research methods	ENVIRONMENTS; FIELDWORK; VIOLENCE	MotivationFragility and closing civic space present significant challenges for research, making research processes more onerous and difficult, particularly on social and political issues. And yet these contexts may be those that may most need to be researched to understand the trend in democratic backsliding being witnessed in many parts of the world. PurposeHow can researchers navigate difficult contexts characterized by fragility and closing space to conduct rigorous yet safe research? We contribute to a growing literature on this question by exploring researcher strategies in contexts characterized by both fragility and closing civic spaces, as well as the obstacles and challenges they face. Methods and approachWe draw on the reflections and experiences of researchers directly engaged in managing and undertaking research on social and political action in four contexts affected by varying levels of conflict and violence over a five-year period. Their insights were gathered through observations, informal interviews and discussions over that time, and a focus group discussion. FindingsBased on the experiences of these researchers we argue that fragile citizen-state relations make the research process and its associated relationships themselves more fragile, indeterminate, and tentative. We note challenges of access, both formal and informal, low trust, and ethical dilemmas. We then highlight four strategies that stand out as common in navigating these challenges and undertaking research successfully. Policy implicationsWe argue that research in fragile contexts with closing civic spaces needs long-term collaboration with local partners that includes building the capacity of emerging researchers and maintaining close accompaniment to create relationships of equality and a community of practice. This requires such research to be more rather than less involved and engaged with participants and research partners located in these contexts, in contrast to suggestions elsewhere that more remote or virtual engagement is the answer. But this research needs to take account upfront of the inherent challenges and uncertainty of research process, and where findings can be safely shared.

There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, a soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix is presented. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on-demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, it is shown that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, a quadruped robot is demonstrated that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

Envisioning motherhood: Mental-state language in caregiving narratives across the perinatal period	INFANT MENTAL HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						mentalization; mental-state language; narratives; postpartum; pregnancy	DRUG-DEPENDENT MOTHERS; MIND-MINDEDNESS; PARENTING INTERVENTIONS; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; ATTACHMENT; CHILDRENS; ASSOCIATION; CONSTRUCT; 1ST; STABILITY	Nancy Suchman's work highlighted the fundamental role of maternal mentalization in maternal addiction, mental health, and caregiving challenges. In this study, we aimed to examine the role of mental-state language (MSL) as a measure of mentalization in prenatal and postnatal narratives and their sentiment in a sample of 91 primarily White mothers from the western United States, followed from the second trimester of pregnancy, through the third trimester, to 4 months postpartum. Specifically, we investigated the use of affective and cognitive MSL in prenatal narratives when mothers visualized caring for their baby and postnatal narratives when mothers compared their prenatal visualization to the current caregiving reality. Results indicated moderate consistency in MSL between the second and third trimesters, but prenatal and postnatal MSL was not significantly correlated. Across all time points, higher use of MSL was related to more positive sentiment, indicating an association between mentalization and positive caregiving representations across the perinatal period. Women used more affective than cognitive MSL in prenatal imagination of caregiving, but this pattern was reversed in their postpartum reflection. Implications on assessing parental mentalization prenatally and considering the relative dominance of affective and cognitive mentalizing are discussed while considering study limitations.

However, it is not obvious how digital influence translates to leverage on-ground action, particularly in its impact on protest movements that challenge the status quo. In our study, we seek to clarify these conceptual issues with the idea of influence in digital politics and develop a framework to understand its institutional impact, particularly in the Global South. Taking two prominent movements, #BlackLivesMatter, which was successful in changing the state's policy on racism, and #AntiCAA in India, a similar movement that achieved less success, we develop a comparative framework that can be applied to understand the limits of digital influence in the Global South. Highlighting the difference in their institutional contexts, we show that digital influence emerges not only in terms of its positive impact but also in the negative impact it can have when the state and its institution seek to counter the protests.

The (sub)grains of ferrite are significantly refined at the temperature of 1050 degrees C using the strain rate of 0.01 to 1 s(-1). The softening mechanism within ferrite are classified as continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX). However, the dynamic softening within ferrite is diminished at a strain rate of 10 s(-1). A softening mechanism analogous to discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) is observed in the ferrite/austenite interphase mantle regions. The dynamic softening within austenite is remarkably limited at the temperature of 1050 degrees C, which appears to be complex-shaped deformation bands. There are a small number of recrystallized grains within austenite. The dynamic softening of hyper duplex stainless steel is dominated by ferrite. The formation of DRX nuclei and growth of austenite by strain-induced boundary migration mechanism is observed at the temperature of 1250 degrees C with different strain rates, indicating its softening mechanism is akin to DDRX. In addition, the increase in temperature and the decrease in strain rate is favorable to the dynamic softening of austenite.

Research has demonstrated the significance of autophagy in DR, which is a critical intracellular homeostasis mechanism required for the destruction and recovery of cytoplasmic components. Autophagy maintains the physiological function of senescent and impaired organelles under stress situations, thereby regulating cell fate via various signals. As the retina's functional and fundamental unit, the retinal neurovascular unit (NVU) is critical in keeping the retinal environment's stability and supporting the needs of retinal metabolism. However, autophagy is essential for the normal NVU structure and function. We discuss the strong association between DR and autophagy in this review, as well as the many kinds of autophagy and its crucial physiological activities in the retina. By evaluating the pathological changes of retinal NVU in DR and the latest advancements in the molecular mechanisms of autophagy that may be involved in the pathophysiology of DR in NVU, we seek to propose new ideas and methods for the prevention and treatment of DR.

The treatment of perilunate injuries remains challenging and contentious. This study aims to describe a novel mini-invasive surgical technique of arthroscopic-assisted reduction and robot-assisted fixation for the treatment of trans-scaphoid perilunate fracture dislocations (PLFDs). MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed patients with PLFDs after surgical treatment from February 2021 to March 2021. The patients underwent arthroscopic-assisted precise reduction and robot-assisted headless screw fixation. Times of guide wire placement were recorded intraoperatively. Periodic follow-up was performed until union of scaphoid fracture was confirmed. Range of motion of the wrist, grip strength, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, the Mayo Wrist Score, the Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score, the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), and osteoarthritis were evaluated at the final follow-up. ResultsTwo male patients presenting with PLFDs with an average age of 24.5 years old (32 and 17 years) were included in this study. Intraoperatively, anatomic reduction of the scaphoid fracture was achieved under arthroscopic guidance. A robotic-assisted single-attempt guidewire insertion was performed for scaphoid fracture and lunotriquetral interval. The CT scans at 8 and 12 weeks showed the union of the scaphoid fracture. At final mean follow-up of 13.5 months, the extension, radial-ulnar deviation, and pronation-supination were consistent with the contralateral side in both patients. One patient experienced mild limited range of motion with the flexion 46 degrees of the injured wrist compared with 81 degrees of the contralateral wrist. The VAS score was 0 and 2. The grip strength was 32 and 26 kg compared with 24 and 42 kg of the contralateral wrist. The PRWE score was 13 and 10 and the QuickDASH score was 2 and 7. The Mayo Wrist Score was 100 and 65. No sign of osteoarthritis was found at the last follow-up. ConclusionsArthroscopic-assisted reduction and robot-assisted fixation is a viable and promising alternative for the treatment of perilunate fracture dislocations. This technique allows precise reduction and accurate placement of the K-wires/screws into the carpal bones through the optimal biomechanical paths.

Defining factors related to anxiety and depression and exploring the role of demoralization and satisfaction with care, could contribute to the improvement of patients' quality of life and quality of health services as well. MethodsA convenience sample of 150 cancer inpatients and outpatients from two oncology centers, with various types of solid tumors, participated in a prospective cross-sectional observational study. The psychometric tools used were the Greek versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, FAMCARE-Patient Scale and Oncology Palliative Care (FAMCARESCALE) and Demoralization Scale (DEMORALIZATION SCALE II, DS-II). ResultsPatients mean age was 62 years (20-85 years) and 89 patients (59.3%) were women. Among patients, 33% had breast, 24% gastrointestinal and 15% lung cancer. Eighty-two patients (54.7%) had metastatic disease. Women showed higher rates of anxiety (p = 0.054). Anxiety was inversely related to age (p = 0.043) and positively correlated with time since diagnosis (p = 0.076). Unmarried patients presented with higher rates of depression (p = 0.026). Multiple linear regression showed a statistically significant impact of Demoralization factor 'Meaning and Purpose' on anxiety (p < 0.001, R-2 = 36.3%) and depression (p < 0.001, R-2 = 49%). Moreover, higher educational level (p = 0.038, R-2 = 3.1%) is related to higher levels of anxiety and higher scores of FAMCARESCALE factor-Information/interaction with the health care professionals, is related to lower levels of depression (p = 0.008, R-2 = 2.7%). ConclusionsThe results highlight the significant impact of demoralization on anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Early recognition of demoralization and early referral to mental health professionals will hopefully alleviate the mental burden of cancer patients.

MethodsOn August 3, 2022, studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations were followed. We included cross-sectional studies that examined healthcare students' knowledge, attitudes, skills, and perceptions of AI in this review. Using the eligibility requirements as a guide, titles and abstracts were screened. Complete texts were then retrieved and independently reviewed per the eligibility requirements. To collect data, a standardized form was used. ResultsOf the 38 included studies, 29 (76%) of healthcare students had a positive and promising attitude towards AI in the clinical profession and its use in he future; however, in nine of the studies (24%), students considered AI a threat to healthcare fields and had a negative attitude towards it. Furthermore, 26 studies evaluated the knowledge of healthcare students about AI. Among these, 18 studies evaluated the level of student knowledge as low (50%). On the other hand, in six of the studies, students' high knowledge of AI was reported, and two of the studies reported average student general knowledge (almost 50%). Of the six studies, four (67%) of the students had very low skills, so they stated that they had never worked with AI. ConclusionEvidence from this review shows that healthcare students had a positive and promising attitude towards AI in medicine; however, most students had low knowledge and limited skills in working with AI. Face-to-face instruction, training manuals, and detailed instructions are therefore crucial for implementing and comprehending how AI technology works and raising students' knowledge of the advantages of AI.

Structural investigation of CDCA3-Cdh1 protein-protein interactions using <i>in vitro</i> studies and molecular dynamics simulation	PROTEIN SCIENCE			English	Article						anaphase-promoting complex; cyclosome; CDCA3; Cdh1; co-immunoprecipitation; molecular dynamics simulation; pairwise energy decomposition	SECONDARY STRUCTURE; AMBER; APC/C; RECOGNITION; PERFORMANCE; EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; CANCER; STATES	The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) ubiquitin ligase and its cofactor, Cdh1, regulate the expression of several cell-cycle proteins and their functions during mitosis. Levels of the protein cell division cycle-associated protein 3 (CDCA3), which is functionally required for mitotic entry, are regulated by APC/C-Cdh1. CDCA3 is an intrinsically disordered protein and contains both C-terminal KEN box and D-box recognition motifs, enabling binding to Cdh1. Our previous findings demonstrate that CDCA3 has a phosphorylation-dependent non-canonical ABBA-like motif within the linker region bridging these two recognition motifs and is required for efficient binding to Cdh1. Here, we sought to identify and further characterize additional residues that participate within this ABBA-like motif using detailed in vitro experiments and in silico modeling studies. We identified the role of H-bonds, hydrophobic and ionic interactions across the CDCA3 ABBA-like motif in the linker region between KEN and D-box motifs. This linker region adopts a well-defined structure when bound to Cdh1 in the presence of phosphorylation. Upon alanine mutation, the structure of this region is lost, leading to higher flexibility, and alteration in affinities due to binding to alternate sites on Cdh1. Our findings identify roles for the anchoring residues in the non-canonical ABBA-like motif to promote binding to the APC/C-Cdh1 and regulation of CDCA3 protein levels.

Estimating body mass of wild pigs (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) using body morphometrics	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						body weight; morphometric characteristics; physical condition; population management; Sus scrofa; wild pig; wildlife management	WHITE-TAILED DEER; FORAGE QUALITY; WEIGHT; BOAR; POPULATIONS; INDICATORS; SIZE; NUTRITION; IMPACT; SOILS	Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are invading many areas globally and impacting biodiversity and economies in their non-native range. Thus, wild pigs are often targeted for eradication efforts. Age- and sex-specific body measurements are important for informing these eradication efforts because they reflect body condition, resource availability, and fecundity, which are common indicators of population trajectory. However, body mass is often difficult to collect, especially on large individuals that require specialized equipment or multiple people to weigh. Measurements that can be rapidly taken by a single land or wildlife manager on any size wild pig without aid from specialized equipment would be beneficial if they accurately infer wild pig body mass. Our goals were to assess whether morphometric measurements could accurately predict wild pig body mass, and to provide tools to directly input these measures and estimate wild pig body mass. Using linear models, we quantified the relationship between body mass and morphometric measurements (i.e., body length, chest girth, ear length, eye to snout length, hindfoot length, shoulder length, and tail length) from a subset (n = 102) of wild pigs culled at the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Mississippi, USA. We evaluated separate models for each individual morphometric measurement. We then used the model coefficients to develop equations to predict wild pig body mass. We validated these equations predicting body mass of 1592 individuals collected across eight areas in Australia, Guam, and the USA for cross-validation. Each developed equation remained accurate when cross-validated across regions. Body length, chest girth, and shoulder length were the morphometrics that best predicted wild pig body mass. Our analyses indicated it is possible to use the presented equations to infer wild pig body mass from simple metrics.

Detection and diagnosis of melanoma skin cancers in dermoscopic images using pipelined internal module architecture (PIMA) method	MICROSCOPY RESEARCH AND TECHNIQUE			English	Article; Early Access						deep learning; diagnosis; features; melanoma; morphological; skin	CLASSIFICATION	Detection and diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer is important to save the life of humans. The main objective of this article is to perform both detection and diagnosis of the skin cancers in dermoscopy images. Both skin cancer detection and diagnosis system uses deep learning architectures for the effective performance improvement as the main objective. The detection process involves by identifying the cancer affected skin dermoscopy images and the diagnosis process involves by estimating the severity levels of the segmented cancer regions in skin images. This article proposes parallel CNN architecture for the classification of skin images into either melanoma or healthy. Initially, color map histogram equalization (CMHE) method is proposed in this article to enhance the source skin images and then thick and thin edges are detected from the enhanced skin image using the Fuzzy system. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Law's texture features are extracted from the edge detected images and these features are optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) approach. Further, the optimized features are classified by the developed pipelined internal module architecture (PIMA) of deep learning structure. The cancer regions in the classified melanoma skin images are segmented using mathematical morphological process and these segmented cancer regions are diagnosed into either mild or severe using the proposed PIMA structure. The proposed PIMA-based skin cancer classification system is applied and tested on ISIC and HAM 10000 skin image datasets.Research Highlights center dot The melanoma skin cancer is detected and classified using dermoscopy images.center dot The skin dermoscopy images are enhanced using color map histogram equalization.center dot GLCM and Law's texture features are extracted from the enhanced skin images.center dot To propose pipelined internal module architecture (PIMA) for the classification of skin images.

A Review on Self-Assembly of Colloidal Nanoparticles into Clusters, Patterns, and Films: Emerging Synthesis Techniques and Applications	SMALL METHODS			English	Review						colloidal nanoparticles; functional materials; self-assembled clusters; self-assembled films; self-assembly	LATERAL FLOW IMMUNOASSAYS; GOLD NANOPARTICLES; AU NANOPARTICLES; SOLAR-CELL; PLASMONIC NANOSTRUCTURES; EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT; METAL NANOPARTICLES; PHOTONIC CRYSTALS; QUANTUM DOTS; LARGE-SCALE	The colloidal synthesis of functional nanoparticles has gained tremendous scientific attention in the last decades. In parallel to these advancements, another rapidly growing area is the self-assembly or self-organization of these colloidal nanoparticles. First, the organization of nanoparticles into ordered structures is important for obtaining functional interfaces that extend or even amplify the intrinsic properties of the constituting nanoparticles at a larger scale. The synthesis of large-scale interfaces using complex or intricately designed nanostructures as building blocks, requires highly controllable self-assembly techniques down to the nanoscale. In certain cases, for example, when dealing with plasmonic nanoparticles, the assembly of the nanoparticles further enhances their properties by coupling phenomena. In other cases, the process of self-assembly itself is useful in the final application such as in sensing and drug delivery, amongst others. In view of the growing importance of this field, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in the field of nanoparticle self-assembly and their applications. For clarity, the self-assembled nanostructures are classified into two broad categories: finite clusters/patterns, and infinite films. Different state-of-the-art techniques to obtain these nanostructures are discussed in detail, before discussing the applications where the self-assembly significantly enhances the performance of the process.

J	Brown, G				Brown, Gavin			Monkeypox: A challenge for and to geographers	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Editorial Material						England; gay bisexual and men who have sex with men; geographies of sexualities; health geography; Monkeypox; sexual health	RETHINKING	The World Health Organisation declared the 2022 Monkeypox outbreak a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern', following the rapid spread of infections in non-endemic countries. Unlike its usual epidemiology in Africa, most cases reported since May 2022 have been among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). This commentary provides an overview of the current Monkeypox outbreak and public health responses to it, drawing out their uneven geographies and the contribution geographers could make to understanding this. The empirical focus is on Monkeypox in England, but the challenges posed are relevant to the dynamics of the outbreak in the USA and Europe. The commentary concludes by challenging geographers to collaborate across sub-disciplinary boundaries to undertake research that can understand and explain not only the specific dynamics of Monkeypox but also broader geographical aspects of GBMSM's lives that could underpin effective public health work with these populations.

Distinguishing features of fold-switching proteins	PROTEIN SCIENCE			English	Review						fold-switching proteins; intrinsically disordered proteins; metamorphic proteins; protein folding; protein structure prediction	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PREDICTION; P53; BINDING; PHOSPHORYLATION; SEQUENCE; DOMAIN; OLIGOMERIZATION; INTERCONVERSION; DISORDER	Though many folded proteins assume one stable structure that performs one function, a small-but-increasing number remodel their secondary and tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These fold-switching proteins regulate biological processes and are associated with autoimmune dysfunction, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection, and more. Despite their biological importance, it is difficult to computationally predict fold switching. With the aim of advancing computational prediction and experimental characterization of fold switchers, this review discusses several features that distinguish fold-switching proteins from their single-fold and intrinsically disordered counterparts. First, the isolated structures of fold switchers are less stable and more heterogeneous than single folders but more stable and less heterogeneous than intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Second, the sequences of single fold, fold switching, and intrinsically disordered proteins can evolve at distinct rates. Third, proteins from these three classes are best predicted using different computational techniques. Finally, late-breaking results suggest that single folders, fold switchers, and IDPs have distinct patterns of residue-residue coevolution. The review closes by discussing high-throughput and medium-throughput experimental approaches that might be used to identify new fold-switching proteins.

The infection has been intensively considered a common onset and exacerbation of SLE. This study is aimed at elucidating the causal association between SLE and HSV. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian Randomization (TSMR) analysis was systematically conducted to explore the causal effect of SLE and HSV on each other. The causality was estimated by inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger and weighted median methods based on the summary-level genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from a publicly available database. Genetically proxied HSV infection exhibited no causal association with SLE in the forward MR analysis using IVW method (odds ratio [OR] = 0.987; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.891-1.093; p = 0.798), nor did HSV-1 IgG (OR = 1.241; 95% CI: 0.874-1.762; p = 0.227) and HSV-2 IgG (OR = 0.934; 95% CI: 0.821-1.062; p = 0.297). Similar null results with HSV infection (OR = 1.021; 95% CI: 0.986-1.057; p = 0.245), HSV-1 IgG (OR = 1.003; 95% CI: 0.982-1.024; p = 0.788) and HSV-2 IgG (OR = 1.034; 95% CI: 0.991-1.080; p = 0.121) were observed in the reverse MR where SLE served as the exposure. Our study demonstrated no causal association between the genetically predicted HSV and SLE.

The method first utilises the symmetric Toeplitz property of uniform linear array matrices with mutual coupling and cyclic Toeplitz property of uniform circular array coupling matrix, realising the decoupled estimations of target position parameters and sensor error parameters. Then the position parameters of multiple non-circular are directly determined based on the subspace data fusion criterion in a decoupled manner, where the subspaces are obtained using the extended array data model with the non-circular properties of the sources. This results in a significant improvement in the accuracy of the target position estimation and the number of distinguishable sources compared to the traditional mutual coupling calibration algorithm. In addition, the theoretical mean square error expression for the position estimations of the proposed algorithm under the influence of finite sampling is derived based on the matrix perturbation analysis theory, and the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound is given. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical derivation and the superiority of the method is verified by simulation experiments.

J	Dorjey, Y				Dorjey, Yeshey			Role of ultrasound scan in prenatal diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy	CLINICAL CASE REPORTS			English	Article						bladder exstrophy; congenital abnormalities; omphalocele exstrophy imperforated anus; prenatal diagnosis	OEIS COMPLEX	Cloacal exstrophy is a rare and complex ventral abdominal wall defect. Prenatal diagnosis is possible with the use of detailed ultrasound scanning. Prenatal diagnosis of an anomalous fetus helps the parents and their families in making informed decisions. This write-up is to report a case of cloacal exstrophy diagnosed during the prenatal period using an ultrasound scan. The pregnant mother presented at 35 weeks of gestation underwent a detailed ultrasound scanning and note the findings; a large defect on the ventral surface of the anterior abdominal wall extending from the umbilicus to the inferior pelvis, with a large mass protruding through the defect, umbilical cord arising from the proximal part of the mass, with another tubular mass protruding from the inferior aspect of the larger mass giving an appearance of "elephant trunk," absent urinary bladder, absent anal dimple, and scrotum was seen inferior to the mass but failed to appreciate the phallus. Both kidneys were normal, and there was no spinal defect. In addition, pubic bones were widely separated, and there was splaying of the iliac bone. Based on the ultrasound scan findings, a prenatal diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy was made. The pregnant mother and their families were counseled about the anomalous fetus, and they decided to continue the pregnancy. At birth, the abnormalities present in the baby were consistent with the prenatal ultrasound scan findings. On postnatal day 5, the baby underwent a complete primary surgical repair of the defect which comprised of closure of the abdominal wall defect, repair of bladder defect, pelvic osteotomies, and creation of a colostomy. The abnormalities of cloacal exstrophy detected by the ultrasound scan during the prenatal diagnosis period were consistent with the abnormalities detected at birth. This concludes that an ultrasound scan is a reliable tool to diagnose cloacal exstrophy during the prenatal period.

Emerging studies show that m(6)A in noncoding RNAs makes a difference, and the aberrant expression of m(6)A-associated enzymes may cause diseases. The demethylase alkB homologue 5 (ALKBH5) plays diverse roles in different cancers, but its role during gastric cancer (GC) progression is not well known. MethodsThe quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry staining and western blotting assays were used to detect ALKBH5 expression in GC tissues and human GC cell lines. The function assays in vitro and xenograft mouse model in vivo were used to investigate the effects of ALKBH5 during GC progression. RNA sequencing, MeRIP sequencing, RNA stability and luciferase reporter assays were performed to explore the potential molecular mechanisms involved in the function of ALKBH5. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq), RIP and RNA pull-down assays were performed to examine the influence of LINC00659 on the ALKBH5-JAK1 interaction. ResultsALKBH5 was highly expressed in GC samples and associated with aggressive clinical features and poor prognosis. ALKBH5 promoted the abilities of GC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The m(6)A modification on JAK1 mRNA was removed by ALKBH5, which resulted in the upregulated expression of JAK1. LINC00659 facilitated ALKBH5 binding to and upregulated JAK1 mRNA depending on an m(6)A-YTHDF2 manner. Silencing of ALKBH5 or LINC00659 disrupted GC tumourigenesis via the JAK1 axis. JAK1 upregulation activated the JAK1/STAT3 pathway in GC. ConclusionALKBH5 promoted GC development via upregulated JAK1 mRNA expression mediated by LINC00659 in an m(6)A-YTHDF2-dependent manner, and targeting ALKBH5 may be a promising therapeutic method for GC patients.

Face race and sex impact visual fixation strategies for upright and inverted faces in 3-to 6-year-old children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						children; eye tracking; face processing; inversion effect; other-race effect (ORE); visual attention; visual orienting	OWN-GENDER BIAS; EYE-TRACKING; RECOGNITION MEMORY; DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; INVERSION; INFANTS; EXPERIENCE; CATEGORIZATION; INFORMATION	Everyday face experience tends to be biased, such that infants and young children interact more often with own-race and female faces leading to differential processing of faces within these groups relative to others. In the present study, visual fixation strategies were recorded using eye tracking to determine the extent to which face race and sex/gender impact a key index of face processing in 3- to 6-year-old children (n = 47). Children viewed male and female upright and inverted White and Asian faces while visual fixations were recorded. Face orientation was found to have robust effects on children's visual fixations, such that children exhibited shorter first fixation and average fixation durations and a greater number of fixations for inverted compared to upright face trials. First fixations to the eye region were also greater for upright compared to inverted faces. Fewer fixations and longer duration fixations were found for trials with male compared to female faces and for upright compared to inverted unfamiliar-race faces, but not familiar-race faces. These findings demonstrate evidence of differential fixation strategies toward different types of faces in 3- to 6-year-old children, illustrating the importance of experience in the development of visual attention to faces.

J	Faubert, M				Faubert, Michelle			'The Doctor and Devil': The Literary Writing of Slave-Ship Surgeons	JOURNAL FOR EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES			English	Article						slavery; slave ships; slave-ship surgeons; colonial medicine; poetry; drama; reputation; medical ethics		In the annals of writing by physicians from the long eighteenth century, there exists a neglected subset that demands greater attention: the writing of slave-ship surgeons. Such physicians existed on many slave ships, and they were required to attend the crew and kidnapped Africans during the Middle Passage to the colonies. They were also required to keep meticulous records, which became the basis for some of the most powerful evidence brought to bear by parliamentary committees tasked with investigating the slave trade in Britain. I argue that the literary productions of slave-ship surgeons, such as Thomas Trotter's Sea-Weeds (1829) and Thomas Boulton's The Sailor's Farewell (1768), can also shed light on their experiences. The writings of slave-ship surgeons offer an intriguing glimpse into the cognitive dissonance these doctors felt in answering their calling in circumstances designed to undermine its basic principle: to treat and foster human life.

We describe a solid phase synthesis method for the efficient generation of libraries of small macrocycles that contain an electrophile and alkyne handle. The modular synthesis produces libraries that can be directly screened using simple SDS-PAGE readouts and then optimal lead molecules applied to proteomic analysis. We generated a library of 480 macrocyclic peptides containing the weakly reactive fluorosulfate (OSF) electrophile. Initial screening of a subset of the library containing each of the various diversity elements identified initial molecules of interest. The corresponding positional and confirmational isomers were then screened to select molecules that showed specific protein labeling patterns that were dependent on the probe structure. The most promising hits were applied to standard chemoproteomic workflows to identify protein targets. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid, on-resin synthesis of diverse macrocyclic electrophiles to generate new classes of covalent ligands.	[Faucher, Franco F.

A systematic sonographic protocol for imaging inguinofemoral lymph nodes is not commonly used, but could aid in homogenising the reporting of lymph node location and status. This paper unpacks the relative anatomy of the inguinofemoral lymph nodes.

J	Frank, SA				Frank, Steven A.			Optimizing differential equations to fit data and predict outcomes	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						artificial neural networks; automatic differentiation; Bayesian analysis; differential equation models; ecological and evolutionary dynamics; Julia programming language; Langevin dynamics; optimization	GRATING COUPLERS; POLARIZATION SPLITTER; SILICON; ROTATOR; COMPACT; EFFICIENT; MODULATOR; JULIA	Many scientific problems focus on observed patterns of change or on how to design a system to achieve particular dynamics. Those problems often require fitting differential equation models to target trajectories. Fitting such models can be difficult because each evaluation of the fit must calculate the distance between the model and target patterns at numerous points along a trajectory. The gradient of the fit with respect to the model parameters can be challenging to compute. Recent technical advances in automatic differentiation through numerical differential equation solvers potentially change the fitting process into a relatively easy problem, opening up new possibilities to study dynamics. However, application of the new tools to real data may fail to achieve a good fit. This article illustrates how to overcome a variety of common challenges, using the classic ecological data for oscillations in hare and lynx populations. Models include simple ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which use artificial neural networks to estimate the derivatives of differential equation systems. Comparing the fits obtained with ODEs versus NODEs, representing small and large parameter spaces, and changing the number of variable dimensions provide insight into the geometry of the observed and model trajectories. To analyze the quality of the models for predicting future observations, a Bayesian-inspired preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (pSGLD) calculation of the posterior distribution of predicted model trajectories clarifies the tendency for various models to underfit or overfit the data. Coupling fitted differential equation systems with pSGLD sampling provides a powerful way to study the properties of optimization surfaces, raising an analogy with mutation-selection dynamics on fitness landscapes.

Species distribution models (SDMs) have become a common and powerful tool for analyzing species-environment relationships across geographic space. Although evaluating the distribution of rare species is integral to their conservation, this can be difficult when limited distribution data are available. Community science platforms, such as iNaturalist, have emerged as alternative sources for species occurrence data. Although these observations are often thought to be of lower quality than those of natural history collections, they may have potential for improving SDMs for species with few occurrence records from collections. Here, we investigate the utility of iNaturalist data for developing SDMs for a rare high-elevation plant, Telesonix jamesii. Because methods for modeling rare species are limited in the literature, five different modeling techniques were considered, including profile methods, statistical models, and machine learning algorithms. The inclusion of iNaturalist data doubled the number of usable records for T. jamesii. We found that a random forest (RF) model using ensemble training data performed the highest of any model (area under curve = 0.98). We then compared the performance of RF models that use only natural history training data and those that use a combination of natural history (herbarium specimens) and iNaturalist training data. All models heavily relied on climate data (mean temperature of driest quarter, and precipitation of the warmest quarter), indicating that this species is under threat as climate continues to change. Validation datasets affected model fits as well. Models using only herbarium data performed slightly poorer when evaluated with cross-validation than when validated externally with iNaturalist data. This study can serve as a model for future SDM studies of species with similar data limitations.

Co-occurrence of native white-tailed deer and invasive wild pigs: Evidence for competition?

Here, we examined how the presence and density of an invasive species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa), affect native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter, deer) on the Savannah River Site, SC, USA. We examined potential changes in deer areas of use, temporal overlap, and occupancy to evaluate the effects of wild pig occurrence and density on deer space use, diel activity, and co-occurrence with wild pigs across 9 months during 2018 and 2019. Wild pig density had the strongest effect on deer space use in high- and moderate-use areas. Declines in deer space use in response to wild pig density were most pronounced in March and October 2018 and April 2019 for females, while male space use declined in response to wild pig density in October and December 2018. Both species were largely nocturnal with high overlap in diel activity across months. Deer occupancy responses to wild pig density varied across months, with negative responses in May and October 2018 and positive responses in July 2018 and April 2019. Deer and wild pigs co-occurred at 30%-59% of camera stations across months, with broadscale co-occurrence patterns being unaffected by changes in shared cover or wild pig occurrence. Overall, our results suggest that deer make fine-scale behavioral adjustments to avoid wild pigs, providing evidence that competition is likely occurring even where wild pig density is relatively low. Such fine-scale behavioral plasticity in deer appears to mitigate the costs of competition with wild pigs and may be a mechanism enabling long-term co-existence of deer and wild pigs. Our study provides novel insight on the complexities of spatiotemporal relationships between invasive wild pigs and native deer and suggests that the negative effects of interactions between deer and wild pigs may be more pronounced when deer life history needs are particularly demanding. In areas where eradication of invasive wild pigs may be impossible, maintaining low wild pig densities may help mitigate, but may not eliminate, the negative effects of wild pigs on deer.

Cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) has recently emerged as a crucial second messenger with implications in processes including osmoregulation, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, virulence, DNA repair, ion homeostasis, and sporulation, and has potential therapeutic applications. The contrasting activities of the enzymes diadenylate cyclase (DAC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) determine the equilibrium levels of c-di-AMP. Although c-di-AMP is suspected of playing an essential role in the pathophysiology of bacterial infections and in regulating host-pathogen interactions, the mechanisms of its regulation remain relatively unexplored in mycobacteria. In this report, we biochemically and structurally characterize the c-di-AMP synthase (MsDisA) from Mycobacterium smegmatis. The enzyme activity is regulated by pH and substrate concentration; conditions of significance in the homoeostasis of c-di-AMP levels. Substrate binding stimulates conformational changes in the protein, and pApA and ppApA are synthetic intermediates detectable when enzyme efficiency is low. Unlike the orthologous Bacillus subtilis enzyme, MsDisA does not bind to, and its activity is not influenced in the presence of DNA. Furthermore, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of MsDisA, revealing asymmetry in its structure in contrast to the symmetric crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima DisA. We also demonstrate that the N-terminal minimal region alone is sufficient and essential for oligomerization and catalytic activity. Our data shed light on the regulation of mycobacterial DisA and possible future directions to pursue.

The black hole solution obtained in this framework is different from a corresponding black hole in General Relativity. The black hole metric function, as well as the Hawking temperature, is affected by the presence of energy-momentum conservation violation. The presence of energy-momentum conservation violation also affects the isenthalpic and inversion temperature curves, and with an increase in the Rastall parameter, the inversion temperature rises slowly. The impacts of other parameters, such as charge, structural constant etc., are investigated and compared. The black hole shadow, as well as the energy emission rate of the black hole, decreases with an increase in the Rastall parameter. Hence, the black holes evaporate slowly in presence of energy-momentum conservation violation.

Two novel recombinant human mastadenovirus D genotypes associated with acute respiratory illness	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY			English	Article						adenovirus; adenovirus type D109; adenovirus type D110; febrile respiratory illness; human adenovirus species D	UNITED-STATES; SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; ADENOVIRUSES; SURVEILLANCE; INFECTIONS; INFLUENZA	Two novel genotypes of species human mastadenovirus D designated 109 and 110 were isolated from three epidemiologically unrelated cases of acute respiratory disease detected in January 2018 by surveillance efforts at the California/Mexico border. Both genotypes represent examples of intertypic recombination. Genotype D109 is most closely related to genotype D56 (97.68% genomic similarity) and features a type D22-like penton base, a type D19-like hexon gene, and a type D9-like fiber [P22/H19/F9]. On the other hand, genotype D110 is most closely related to type D22 (96.94% genomic similarity) and features a type D67-like penton base, a novel hexon gene, and a type D9-like fiber [P67/H110/F9]. Importantly, the fibers of both novel genotypes are highly similar to those of genotypes D56 and D59, which have also been isolated from a few cases of respiratory infections. The present report shows data contributing to the understanding of the molecular determinants of the expanded tissue tropism of certain members of species HAdV-D.

We examined whether fatty acids (FAs) and lipids are potentially associated with the pharmacoresistance to valproic acid (VPA) therapy. MethodsThis single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from pediatric patients collected between May 2019 and December 2019 at the Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Ninety plasma samples from 53 responders with VPA monotherapy (RE group) and 37 non-responders with VPA polytherapy (NR group) were collected. Non-targeted metabolomics and lipidomics analysis for those plasma samples were performed to compare the potential differences of small metabolites and lipids between the two groups. Plasma metabolites and lipids passing the threshold of variable importance in projection value >1, fold change >1.2 or <0.8, and p-value A total of 204 small metabolites and 433 lipids comprising 16 different lipid subclasses were identified. The well-established partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed a good separation of the RE from the NR group. The FAs and glycerophospholipids status were significantly decreased in the NR group, but their triglycerides (TG) levels were significantly increased. The trend of TG levels in routine laboratory tests was in line with the lipidomics analysis. Meanwhile, cases from the NR group were characterized by a decreased level of citric acid and L-thyroxine, but with an increased level of glucose and 2-oxoglutarate. The top two enriched metabolic pathways involved in the DRE condition were biosynthesis of unsaturated FAs and linoleic acid metabolism. SignificanceThe results of this study suggested an association between metabolism of FAs and the medically intractable epilepsy. Such novel findings might propose a potential mechanism linked to the energy metabolism. Ketogenic acid and FAs supplementation might therefore be high-priority strategies for DRE management.

Many scientists, including hydrologists, view this tool and others like it as threats, while others dismiss them as irrelevant distractions. Although the capability of this technology to 'do' hydrological research is lacking, AI tools like ChatGPT present significant opportunities-with caveats-for the hydrology community and deserve close inspection by all.

The client net state: Trajectories of state control over cyberspace	POLICY AND INTERNET			English	Article						actor-network theory; cyber policy; international relations; net state; WeChat	WECHAT; GOVERNANCE; DEMOCRACY	Social media corporations have become fixtures of daily life to the extent they are regularly compared to states in size and scope. These corporations and their platforms have become the dominant stakeholders of cyberspace, operating as state-like cyber actors, or net states. Previous approaches have limited the net state to the online, framing their populations and agendas separate to the material reality of their everyday operations, overlooking the tangible overlap between sovereignty and cyberspace. In this article, we examine whether net states can be co-opted into the apparatus of state in a manner comparable to client states. We examine the case of WeChat, the Chinese multipurpose messaging and social media app developed by Tencent in its operation as a client net state of the People's Republic of China. The interactions between these actors are mapped using a methodological framework incorporating actor-network theory to demonstrate the existence of client net states, and how they may be deployed to expand a state's influence and cyber sovereignty beyond its physical borders.

Some species use multiple colors to create different effects. Most dragonflies change their body color unilaterally with maturation, whereas in a few species these changes are reversible. Both sexes of the damselfly Indolestes peregrinus show temperature-dependent reversible body color changes, with a brown color when the ambient temperature decreases and a blue color when the temperature increases. To elucidate the temperature range at which this color change occurs and the exact elapsed time for the color change, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine whether the time required for body color change was related to ambient temperature and whether sex differences affected this duration. The body color and time required for the change were recorded under four temperature conditions. Bluing was completed in a few minutes, whereas browning took several hours. Moreover, sexual differences were observed, whereby males showed a more rapid transformation to blue than that of females. Our results suggest that the rapid bluing has some importance in this species, especially in males.

Little is known about the dynamic changes of antibody response in SARS convalescents inoculated with three doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine although lack of cross-neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in SARS survivors has been reported. We longitudinally examined the neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as well as spikes binding IgA, IgG, IgM, IgG1, and IgG3 antibodies in 9 SARS-recovered donors and 21 SARS-naive donors. Stably higher nAbs and spike antigens-specific IgA, IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in SARS-recovered donors compared with SARS-naive donors during the period with two doses of BBIBP-CorV vaccination. However, the third-dose BBIBP-CorV stimulated a sharply and shortly higher increase of nAbs in SARS-naive donors than in SARS-recovered donors. It is worth noting that, regardless of prior SARS infection, the Omicron subvariants were found to subvert immune responses. Moreover, certain subvariants such as BA.2, BA.2.75, or BA.5 exhibited a high degree of immune evasion in SARS survivors. Interestingly, BBIBP-CorV recalled higher nAbs against SARS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV-2 in SARS-recovered donors. In SARS survivors, a single dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine provoked immune imprinting for the SARS antigen, providing protection against wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and the earlier variants of concern (VOCs) including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta but not against Omicron subvariants. As such, it is important to evaluate the type and dosage of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for SARS survivors.

J	Jing, BW; Rojas, SS; Lindsey, BD				Jing, Bowen; Rojas, Stephan Strassle; Lindsey, Brooks D.			Effect of skull porosity on ultrasound transmission and wave mode conversion at large incidence angles	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						incidence angle; mode conversion; porosity; shear wave; transcranial ultrasound	BRAIN THERAPY; PROPAGATION; SIMULATION; NEUROMODULATION; ATTENUATION; DESIGN; ARRAY	BackgroundTranscranial ultrasound imaging and therapy depend on the efficient transmission of acoustic energy through the skull. Multiple previous studies have concluded that a large incidence angle should be avoided during transcranial-focused ultrasound therapy to ensure transmission through the skull. Alternatively, some other studies have shown that longitudinal-to-shear wave mode conversion might improve transmission through the skull when the incidence angle is increased above the critical angle (i.e., 25 degrees to 30 degrees). PurposeThe effect of skull porosity on the transmission of ultrasound through the skull at varying incidence angles was investigated for the first time to elucidate why transmission through the skull at large angles of incidence is decreased in some cases but improved in other cases. MethodsTranscranial ultrasound transmission at varying incidence angles (0 degrees-50 degrees) was investigated in phantoms and ex vivo skull samples with varying bone porosity (0% to 28.54% +/- 3.36%) using both numerical and experimental methods. First, the elastic acoustic wave transmission through the skull was simulated using micro-computed tomography data of ex vivo skull samples. The trans-skull pressure was compared between skull segments having three levels of porosity, that is, low porosity (2.65% +/- 0.03%), medium porosity (13.41% +/- 0.12%), and high porosity (26.9%). Next, transmission through two 3D-printed resin skull phantoms (compact vs. porous phantoms) was experimentally measured to test the effect of porous microstructure alone on ultrasound transmission through flat plates. Finally, the effect of skull porosity on ultrasound transmission was investigated experimentally by comparing transmission through two ex vivo human skull segments having similar thicknesses but different porosities (13.78% +/- 2.05% vs. 28.54% +/- 3.36%). ResultsNumerical simulations indicated that an increase in transmission pressure occurs at large incidence angles for skull segments having low porosities but not for those with high porosity. In experimental studies, a similar phenomenon was observed. Specifically, for the low porosity skull sample (13.78% +/- 2.05%), the normalized pressure was 0.25 when the incidence angle increased to 35 degrees. However, for the high porosity sample (28.54% +/- 3.36%), the pressure was no more than 0.1 at large incidence angles. ConclusionsThese results indicate that the skull porosity has an evident effect on the transmission of ultrasound at large incidence angles. The wave mode conversion at large, oblique incidence angles could enhance the transmission of ultrasound through parts of the skull having lower porosity in the trabecular layer. However, for transcranial ultrasound therapy in the presence of highly porous trabecular bone, transmission at a normal incidence angle is preferable relative to oblique incidence angles due to the higher transmission efficiency.

The proposed algorithm adopts a new piecewise function as a switching function to reduce system chattering. The low pass filter in the conventional sliding-mode observer is substituted with a complex coefficient filter in the proposed algorithm to solve the phase delay caused by the low pass filter. Moreover, the counter emf back obtained using the filtering of the complex coefficient filter is reintroduced into the sliding-mode observer to decrease the sliding-mode gain coefficient and reduce chattering in the system. the simulation results suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional sliding-mode observer control algorithm in reducing chattering, increasing the convergence speed, reducing torque pulsation, increasing speed estimation accuracy and coping with speed and load mutation.

J	Keeble, E				Keeble, Emma			Ear disease in pet rabbits	IN PRACTICE			English	Editorial Material							SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT	Background: Ear disease is a common presenting condition in pet rabbits in veterinary practice and can involve any or all parts of the ear - the external ear canal, the middle ear and the inner ear. Our knowledge of ear disease in this species has advanced significantly over the past 10 years, with recent and relevant publications reported in the literature. A higher incidence occurs in lop-eared rabbits, thought to be due to their pinna anatomy (Johnson and Burn 2019). Aim of the article: This article reviews rabbit ear disease, focusing on clinical signs, diagnostics and treatment in pet rabbits. Clinical signs may vary depending on the severity, chronicity and anatomical location and range, from ear scratching and head shaking with otitis externa, to facial muscle contracture and neurological deficits with otitis media. The diagnosis of ear disease is also covered in this article, which is based on clinical signs and clinical examination findings, along with diagnostic imaging, ear cytology and culture. Treatment options for rabbits with ear disease are outlined as well; these vary depending on the clinical signs, disease location and severity. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of ear disease in pet rabbits is essential to avoid progression of disease and clinical signs. This article is a useful overview for all veterinary staff treating pet rabbits in veterinary practice.

They are key players in N-2 fixation through their microbiome, which is an important process for nutrient buildup during primary succession. How these moss-microbe interactions develop during succession is not well studied and is relevant in the light of climate change and increased glacier retreat. We examined how the bacterial communities associated with two moss species of the genus Racomitrium and the underlying soil, as well as moss traits and nitrogen fixation, develop along a successional gradient in the glacier forefield of Flaajokull in southeast Iceland. In addition, we tested whether moss functional traits, such as total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents, moss moisture content, and moss shoot length are drivers of moss and underlying soil bacterial communities. Although time since deglaciation did not affect TN and moss moisture contents, TC and shoot length increased with time since deglaciation. Moss and underlying soil bacterial communities were distinct. While the soil bacterial community structure was driven by moss C/N ratios, the moss bacterial community structure was linked to time since deglaciation, moss C/N ratio, and moss moisture content. Moss N-2-fixation rates were linked to bacterial community composition and nifH gene abundance rather than moss TN or time since deglaciation. This was accompanied by a shift from autotrophic to heterotrophic diazotrophs. Overall, our results suggest that there is little lateral transfer between moss and soil bacterial communities and that moss traits affect moss and soil bacterial community structure. Only moss bacterial community changed with time since deglaciation. In addition, moss N-2-fixation rates are determined by bacterial community structure, rather than moss traits or time since deglaciation. This study on the interplay between succession, mosses, soils, and their bacterial communities will inform future work on the fate of newly exposed areas as a result of glacier retreat.

Healthcare professionals struggle with parental responses to loss. This study aimed to understand parental coping with grief during their child's end of life.Methods: A grounded theory study was performed, using semi-structured interviews with parents during the child's end of life and recently bereaved parents. Data were collected in four children's university hospitals and paediatric homecare services between October 2020 and December 2021. A multidisciplinary team conducted the analysis.Results: In total, 38 parents of 22 children participated. Parents strived to sustain family life, to be a good parent and to ensure a full life for their child. Meanwhile parents' grief increased because of their hypervigilance towards signs of loss. Parents' coping with grief is characterised by an interplay of downregulating grief and connecting with grief, aimed at creating emotional space to be present and connect with their child. Parents connected with grief when it was forced upon them or when they momentarily allowed themselves to.Conclusion: The parents' ability to engage with grief becomes strained during the end of life. Healthcare professionals should support parents in their search for a balance that facilitates creating emotional space.	[Kochen, Eline M.; Teunissen, Saskia C. C.

Annual, seasonal, and monthly means were used in the analysis. Results showed differences due to influences from topography, predominant synoptic situations, and possible teleconnection with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). According to our criteria, the annual number of cloudy-sky days (similar to 80-120) was higher than that of selected clear-sky days (similar to 50-90), except for 3 years of prevailing anticyclonic circulations. A maximum cloudiness frequency was in winter (December), while a minimum frequency was in summer (August). TCA variability was the highest in an area of complex orography. Southeast Serbia was characterized by the smallest daily temporal variation of TCA based on 7, 14, and 21 h observations as well as by a high number of clear-sky days during all seasons, while the western mountainous part was much cloudier. From October to January, morning TCA was higher than afternoon TCA, ranging from 70% (January) to 78% (December). Statistically significant positive trends in the number of cloudy-sky days were found for three stations. A statistically significant moderate positive/negative correlation coefficient was found between the monthly cumulative frequencies of clear-sky/cloudy-sky days and the NAO for the winter seasons, respectively. During the 18 winters with the negative NAO index (i.e., frequent westerly warm and moist advection), there were approximately six times more cloudy-sky days (588) than clear-sky days (88).

Results showed that the choriocapillaris in Xenopus consisted of a dense meshwork of wide capillaries displaying polygonal arrays at the scleral side with venules leaving the centers and arterioles supplied from the periphery. The choriocapillaris lacked the multilayered capillary meshwork described in ranids. Iris and ciliary body were supplied by nasal and temporal branches of the iridial artery, which either originated with a common stem from the hyaloid artery or arose as individual vessels from the proximal portions of the semicircular nasal and temporal branches of the hyaloid artery. These branches ran in the pupillary margin and supplied the two-dimensional capillary network of the iris, as well as the three-dimensional network of the ciliary body. Iris and ciliary body drained via parallel running vasa recta into the choriocapillaris. The superficial vascular hyaloid bed (system) was supplied by the hyaloid artery. This artery coursed along the scleral surface of the ventrotemporal choriocapillaris toward the ora serrata, where it bifurcated into a temporal and a nasal semicircular branch. Seven to 10 arterial meridional twigs arose from these branches and supplied the superficial hyaloid capillary bed. Capillaries drained into branches of the hyaloid vein, which ascended toward the ora serrata, where the hyaloid vein joined the temporal branch of the ciliary vein.

Here, we demonstrate the potential of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in targeting iCCA. MethodsMasson's trichrome staining was used to assess the effect of ARBs in iCCA specimens, CCK8 and gel contraction assays in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were used for mechanistic investigations. ResultsPatients with iCCA who were administered ARBs had a better prognosis and a lower proportion of tumour stroma, indicating alleviated fibrosis. The presence of AGTR1, the ARBs receptor, is associated with a poor prognosis of iCCA and is highly expressed in tumour tissues and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The ARBs strongly attenuated the viability of (AGTR1+)CAFs in vitro and retarded tumour progression and fibrosis in xenograft models of co-cultured CAFs and iCCA cells. Still, they did not have a significant effect on (AGTR1-)CAFs. Moreover, ARBs decreased the secretion of (AGTR1+)CAF-derived MFAP5 via the Hippo pathway, weakened the interaction between CAFs and iCCA cells, and impaired the aggressiveness of iCCA cells by attenuating the activation of the Notch1 pathway in iCCA cells. ConclusionsARBs exhibit anti-fibrotic function by inhibiting the viability of (AGTR1+)CAFs. These findings support using ARBs as a novel therapeutic option for targeting iCCA.

J	Link, BG				Link, Bruce G.			On the history and growth of the stigma concept: A reflection on the positioning of social relationships in stigma research	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES			English	Review							STRUCTURAL STIGMA; HEALTH	The stigma concept has been tremendously successful one. Before Goffman's influential book only a handful of papers used the term in the abstract or title of a paper-in 2020 there were 3464. While the reason for stigma's dramatic growth is likely over determined two possibilities are suggested. The first is the usefulness that the concept carries for understanding the shame, social awkwardness, rejection, misunderstanding, and exclusion that people frequently experience across so many stigmatizing circumstances. The second is that the complexity of the stigma experience provides an enormous number of research puzzles in need of investigation as there are so many different stigmatizing circumstances that are affected at multiple levels across multiple outcomes. The current special issue addresses this complexity by focusing on the particularly important domain of social relationships but at the same allows complexity in the types of stigmatizing circumstances considered and the levels at which they are investigated. In what might be a model for the stigma field as it faces its tremendous growth, Doyle and Barreto (2023) use the multiple contributions to the special issue to develop thematic questions that will guide future research into stigma and social relationships.

The chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) mouse model is a well-established model of SLE. LC3-associated autophagy plays a critical role in extracellular particle clearance, including pathogens and apoptotic cells. Lupus Recipe (LR) is a Chinese herbal compound that has been proven to be effective in treating SLE. In the study, we investigated the protective effects of LR or LR combined with prednisone on cGVHD mouse model and LC3-associated autophagy in the kidney. The mice were subjected to six groups. The LR treatment group received LR at the dosage of 1.15 and 2.3 g/kg/day, respectively. The corticosteroid treatment group received prednisone at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day. The combination treatment group received LR at a dosage of 2.3 g/kg/day, and prednisone at 2.5 mg/kg/day. LR treatment reduced proteinuria and serum triglyceride levels, as well as spleen weight. LR also alleviated pathologic damage and immunoglobulin G deposition in the kidney. LR combined with a low dose of prednisone significantly improved kidney function and decreased serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and spleen weight. In addition, combination treatment relieved kidney injury more effectively than LR alone. Western blot revealed that LR treatment or LR combined with prednisone increased the LC3-associated autophagy protein of Rubicon and Nox2, as well as LC3I levels in the kidney tissues. In conclusion, LR inhibited the manifestation of cGVHD-induced LN, which may attribute to the increased levels of LC3-associated autophagy.

In the current review, we assess how relationship science has approached dissolution research over roughly the past 20 years. We identified 207 studies (from 195 papers) published between 2002-2020 that captured relationship dissolution events and coded the papers for relevant features. The most common methodological approach to studying breakups was a self-report study (92%) in which relationships were tracked over time (72%) and breakups were treated as an outcome variable (79%). These results suggest that most research on dissolution has focused on predictors of it, rather than processes required to uncouple and circumstances surrounding the breakup itself. Coding revealed heterogeneous theoretical approaches, with the most common perspective across papers-social exchange/interdependence theory-informing only 15% of the papers coded. A majority (61%) of samples were representative of the nations, regions, or localities in which the studies were conducted. Yet, samples still tended to be disproportionately comprised of young, white individuals from Western countries. We conclude by discussing potential avenues for moving our understanding of relationship dissolution forward.

Since epidermal water loss depends on epidermal-to-air water vapor gradients, a possible quantitative relationship between TEWL and SCH may exist. This investigation's purpose was to test the possible TEWL-SCH relationship. Materials and MethodsSCH and TEWL were measured noninvasively on forearm and palmer thenar eminence (hand) in 40 young adults (20 males) along with total body fat percentage (FAT) via bioimpedance. ResultsA significant positive nonlinear correlation (p < 0.001) was detected between SCH and TEWL in hands of the male cohort that occurred when SCH exceeded a threshold level. This threshold level was not exceeded in male or female forearms and forearms did not display a SCH-TEWL correlation. There was a weak inverse dependence of TEWL on FAT on both forearm and hand (p < 0.05), but no SCH-FAT relationship was observed. TEWL values on the forearm and hand were moderately correlated with each other (p = 0.002) but SCH values were not. ConclusionThe findings clarify the relationship between forearm and palmer hydration and TEWL values, and their relationship to total body fat percentages in young healthy adults. The significant correlation between palmer stratum corneum hydration and palmer TEWL that was discovered in the male but not the female cohort suggests a threshold hydration level for which TEWL depends both on skin barrier function and stratum corneum hydration. This implies that conditions with increased SCH may in part account for elevated TEWL values.	[Mayrovitz, Harvey N.

However, real-life data on its use is scarce. Therefore, we explored the ER clinical outcome in our outpatients' s cohort, compared to untreated controls. We included all patients who were prescribed ER from February to May 2022 and followed them up for 3 months and compared patients who received treatment with untreated controls. In the two groups the following outcomes were investigated: hospitalization and mortality rate, time of negativization and symptom's resolution, and postacute coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) syndrome prevalence. Overall, 681 patients were analyzed, mostly females (53.6%), and with a median age of 66 years (interquartile range: 54-77), 316 (46.4%) patients received ER, and 365 (53.6%) did not receive antiviral treatment (control group). Overall, 8.5% patients eventually required oxygen support, 8.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 1.5% died. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunization and ER (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.049 [0.015; 0.16], p < 0.001) independently reduced hospitalization risk. ER was significantly associated with a shorter duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity at nasopharyngeal swabs (a beta -8.15 [-9.21; -7.09], p < 0.001) and of symptoms (a beta -5.11 [-5.82; -4.39], p < 0.001), and with lower rate of COVID-19 sequelae compared to control group (aOR: 0.18 [0.10; 0.31], p < 0.001). Even in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and Omicron era, in patients at high risk of developing severe disease, ER demonstrated to have a good safety profile and to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and COVID-19 sequelae compared to untreated controls.

The rise of animal biotelemetry and genetics research data integration	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Review						animal tracking; biotelemetry; genetics; genomics; individual-based movement; movement ecology	TELEMETRY DATA; MIGRATION; MOVEMENT; CONNECTIVITY; CONSERVATION; RELATEDNESS; POPULATIONS; DISPERSAL; SELECTION	The advancement and availability of innovative animal biotelemetry and genomic technologies are improving our understanding of how the movements of individuals influence gene flow within and between populations and ultimately drive evolutionary and ecological processes. There is a growing body of work that is integrating what were once disparate fields of biology, and here, we reviewed the published literature up until January 2023 (139 papers) to better understand the drivers of this research and how it is improving our knowledge of animal biology. The review showed that the predominant drivers for this research were as follows: (1) understanding how individual-based movements affect animal populations, (2) analyzing the relationship between genetic relatedness and social structuring, and (3) studying how the landscape affects the flow of genes, and how this is impacted by environmental change. However, there was a divergence between taxa as to the most prevalent research aim and the methodologies applied. We also found that after 2010 there was an increase in studies that integrated the two data types using innovative statistical techniques instead of analyzing the data independently using traditional statistics from the respective fields. This new approach greatly improved our understanding of the link between the individual, the population, and the environment and is being used to better conserve and manage species. We discuss the challenges and limitations, as well as the potential for growth and diversification of this research approach. The paper provides a guide for researchers who wish to consider applying these disparate disciplines and advance the field.	[Mueller, Mara. F. F.; Banks, Sam. C. C.; Campbell, Hamish. A.

In this contribution, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model was used to select perovskite materials for electrocatalytic applications from literature. This was accomplished by obtaining word embeddings for perovskite materials from the NLP model and subsequently designing downstream tasks to discover perovskite-based electrocatalyst materials. However, embeddings could be obtained only for materials available in the literature. Consequently, a novel methodology was devised to generate embeddings for newly designed materials. Results from the analysis showed that the computed embeddings could be used to rank materials for their suitability for electrocatalytic applications. Further, the word embeddings were also employed as features in predicting the electrocatalytic activity of perovskite-based electrocatalysts. The analysis demonstrated that the fidelity of regression models increased when the embeddings were used as features.

It is unknown if treatments for disruptive behavior disorders are as effective for children with CU traits (DBD+CU) as those without (DBD-only), nor if treatments directly reduce CU traits. Separate multilevel meta-analyses were conducted to compare treatment effects on DBD symptoms for DBD+CU versus DBD-only children and evaluate direct treatment-related reductions in CU traits, as well as to examine moderating factors for both questions. MethodsWe systematically searched PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochran Library (Trials), EMBASE, MEDLINE, APA PsycNet, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, and uncontrolled studies evaluating child-focused, parenting-focused, pharmacological, family-focused, or multimodal treatments. ResultsSixty studies with 9,405 participants were included (M-age = 10.04, SDage = 3.89 years, 25.09% female, 44.10% racial/ethnic minority). First, treatment was associated with similar reductions in DBD symptoms for DBD+CU (SMD = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.45, 1.72) and DBD-only (SMD = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.38, 1.64). However, DBD+CU started (SMD = 1.18, 95% CI = 0.57, 1.80) and ended (SMD = 0.73, p < .001; 95% CI = 0.43, 1.04) treatment with more DBD symptoms. Second, although there was no overall direct effect of treatment on CU traits (SMD = .09, 95% CI = -0.02, 0.20), there were moderating factors. Significant treatment-related reductions in CU traits were found for studies testing parenting-focused components (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.35), using parent-reported measures (SMD = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04, 0.28), rated as higher quality (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.13, 0.39), conducted outside the United States (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.32), and with less than half the sample from a racial/ethnic minority group (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.002, 0.30). ConclusionsDBD+CU children improve with treatment, but their greater DBD symptom severity requires specialized treatment modules that could be implemented alongside parenting programs. Conclusions are tempered by heterogeneity across studies and scant evidence from randomized controlled trials.

Here we demonstrate that the most abundant fossil in the Pennsylvanian Mazon Creek Lagerstatte of Illinois, Essexella asherae, is an infaunal or semi-infaunal anemone. Essexella is redescribed based on a taphonomic analysis of thousands of specimens, as well as associated medusae and trace fossils. Specimens of Essexella (also known as the 'blobs') were long believed to be medusae, but we reassign Essexella to the order Actiniaria and reinterpret the putative jellyfish Reticulomedusa as the pedal or oral disc of Essexella. We also implicate Essexella as a producer of Conostichus, a widespread plug-shaped trace fossil that occurs in coeval strata in the same region. Radiate structures comparable to the bases of Conostichus and the ichnofossil Bergaueria, as well as the pedal discs of modern anemones, characterize Reticulomedusa. Bona fide medusae are present in the Mazon Creek biota, and include Anthracomedusa turnbulli and Octomedusa pieckorum, whereas the soft-bodied fossil Lascoa mesostaurata is referred to Problematica.

In recent times, many separation techniques have been developed to obtain specific SWCNTs from raw unsorted materials to catalyze the development in this area. This work presents how the aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) method can be enhanced for the straightforward isolation of (6,4) SWCNTs in one step. Introducing nonionic surfactant into the typically employed mixture of anionic surfactants, which drive the partitioning, is essential to increasing the ATPE system's resolution. A thorough analysis of the parameter space by experiments and modeling reveals the underlying interactions between SWCNTs, surfactants, and phase-forming agents, which drive the partitioning. Based on new insight gained on this front, a separation mechanism is proposed. Notably, the developed method is highly robust, which is proven by isolating (6,4) SWCNTs from several raw SWCNT materials, including SWCNT waste generated over the years in the laboratory.

Resveratrol-Induced Suppression of C-type Natriuretic Peptide Associates With Increased Vertebral Bone Density in Postmenopausal Women	JBMR PLUS			English	Article; Early Access						BONE TURNOVER MARKERS; C-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; OSTEOPOROSIS; RESVERATROL	THYROID-HORMONES; FORMS; STIMULATION; EXPRESSION; REGULATOR; MARKERS; CNP	C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is a paracrine growth factor essential in driving endochondral bone growth in mammals including humans. Despite evidence from animal experiments and tissues that CNP signaling stimulates osteoblast proliferation and osteoclast activity, whether CNP participates in bone remodeling in the mature skeleton is unknown. Using stored plasma samples from a previous randomized controlled clinical trial (RESHAW) of resveratrol supplementation in postmenopausal women exhibiting mild osteopenia, we have studied changes in plasma aminoterminal proCNP (NTproCNP) and concurrent change in bone turnover markers of formation (osteocalcin [OC] and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and resorption (C-terminal telopeptide type 1 collagen [CTX]) with bone mineral density (BMD) over a 2-year period of study in 125 subjects. In year one, subjects received placebo or resveratrol, switching to resveratrol or placebo, respectively, in year two. Across all time points, there were no significant associations of NTproCNP with CTX, ALP, or OC. During year one, plasma NTproCNP declined significantly in both groups. In the crossover comparison, analysis of change within individuals showed that, compared with placebo, NTproCNP declined after resveratrol (p = 0.011) and ALP increased (p = 0.008), whereas CTX and OC were unchanged. Inverse association of NTproCNP (r = -0.31; p = 0.025) and positive association of OC (r = 0.32, p = 0.022) with BMD at the lumbar spine were identified after resveratrol but not found after placebo. Decline in NTproCNP was independently associated with resveratrol treatment. This is the first evidence that CNP is modulated during a period of increasing BMD in postmenopausal women. Further study of NTproCNP and associations with drivers of bone formation or resorption can be expected to clarify CNP's role during other interventions directed to bone health in adults.

Comparing Human and Machine Understanding of Visual Representations	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Negation; Photograph; Comic; Illustration; Real-world data; Image captioning; Image classification; Machine learning	WORLD-KNOWLEDGE; SAY NO; LANGUAGE; COMPREHENSION; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION; PICTURES; IMAGE	There is a widely held view that visual representations (images) do not depict negation, for example, as expressed by the sentence, "the train is not coming." The present study focuses on the real-world visual representations of photographs and comic (manga) illustrations and empirically challenges the question of whether humans and machines, that is, modern deep neural networks, can recognize visual representations as expressing negation. By collecting data on the captions humans gave to images and analyzing the occurrences of negation phrases, we show some evidence that humans recognize certain images as expressing negation. Furthermore, based on this finding, we examined whether or not humans and machines can classify novel images as expressing negation. The humans were able to correctly classify images to some extent, as expected from the analysis of the image captions. On the other hand, the machine learning model of image processing was only able to perform this classification at about the chance level, not at the same level of performance as the human. Based on these results, we discuss what makes humans capable of recognizing negation in visual representations, highlighting the role of the background commonsense knowledge that humans can exploit. Comparing human and machine learning performances suggests new ways to understand human cognitive abilities and to build artificial intelligence systems with more human-like abilities to understand logical concepts.

Therefore, this systematic review aims to consolidate all available evidence regarding the associations of parental OT concentration levels with parenting behavior and bonding within the past 20 years. A systematic search was conducted in five databases from 2002 to May 2022, and 33 studies were finalized and included. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, findings were presented narratively based on the type of OT and parenting outcomes. Current evidence strongly suggests that parental OT levels are positively related to parental touch and parental gaze and affect synchrony and observer-coded parent-infant bonding. No gender difference in OT levels was observed between fathers and mothers, but OT strengthens affectionate parenting in mothers and stimulatory parenting in fathers. Child OT levels were also positively associated with parental OT levels. Family and healthcare providers could encourage more positive touch and interactive play between parent and child to strengthen parent-child relationships.

This study aims to study congenital heart disease in Nepal on grounds of burden, commonest type, common presentations, and associated noncardiac anomalies so that its spectrum can be known for prompt diagnosis and adoption of screening protocols. MethodsRelevant articles were searched in electronic databases using appropriate search terms and Boolean operators. Data were extracted in Excel and analyzed in Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software. The proportion was used as an effect measure and a fixed or random-effect model was used as per the heterogeneity. Forest plots were used to give visual feedback. ResultsA total of nine studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis after a rigorous screening of imported studies. The prevalence of congenital heart disease was 0.7% (Proportion: 0.007; CI: 0.001-0.035; I-2: 99.263%). The burden of atrial septal defect was 32.1%, ventricular septal defect was 31.1%, patent ductus arteriosus was 12.6% and Tetralogy of Fallot was 7.3%. The most common presentations were respiratory tract infection (54.7%), developmental delay (49.8%), difficulty in breathing (44.5%), failure to thrive (17.1%), and cyanosis (15.9%). ConclusionsThe prevalence of congenital heart disease in Nepal was 0.7% and the frequency of male patients was higher. The atrial septal defect was the commonest on the whole, while, Tetralogy of Fallot was the commonest among cyanotic variety. Respiratory tract infection was frequently seen at presentation and the most commonly associated noncardiac anomaly was the cleft palate.

This topology utilize half bridge multilevel structure to reduce voltage stress across the transformer windings and the semiconductor switches. Conventionally the power transfer between the ports of a 3PIC were attained by traditional phase-shift modulation (TPM), but this will impose increased current stress and associated losses in the converter at wide change in voltage conversion ratio. To minimize these losses, this paper introduces a 3L3PIC, that is, by employing dual phase-shift modulation (DPM) in 3PIC. Steady state analysis of 3L3PIC are presented and derived the power transfer equations between the ports. The current equations through each port are determined at different combinations of voltage conversion ratios. Procedure for obtaining optimized phase-shift values for both TPM and DPM techniques in 3PIC are explained. A comparison between the modulation schemes in 3PIC is performed and found better results for the DPM technique in terms of reduced current stress, reduced circulating power flow, and extended soft switching region. This in turn leads to a reduction in conduction losses and transformer losses in the converter. A hardware prototype of 1.5 kW 3PIC has been implemented and tested. The experimental results obtained validates with the theoretical analysis.

Although crowding can significantly impact the protein folded state stability, most experiments are conducted in dilute buffered solutions. To resolve the effect of crowding on protein stability, we use F-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to follow the reversible, two-state unfolding thermodynamics of the N-terminal Src homology 3 domain of the Drosophila signal transduction protein drk in the presence of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of various molecular weights and concentrations. Contrary to most current theories of crowding that emphasize steric protein-crowder interactions as the main driving force for entropically favored stabilization, our experiments show that PEG stabilization is accompanied by significant heat release, and entropy disfavors folding. Using our newly developed model, we find that stabilization by ethylene glycol and small PEGs is driven by favorable binding to the folded state. In contrast, for larger PEGs, chemical or soft PEG-protein interactions do not play a significant role. Instead, folding is favored by excluded volume PEG-protein interactions and an exothermic nonideal mixing contribution from release of confined PEG and water upon folding. Our results indicate that crowding acts through molecular interactions subtler than previously assumed and that interactions between solution components with both the folded and unfolded states must be carefully considered.

J	Summers, A				Summers, Alicia			Exploring Indian Child Welfare Act implementation and case outcomes	JUVENILE AND FAMILY COURT JOURNAL			English	Article						American Indian; Alaska native (AI; AN); foster care; implementation; Indian child welfare act; reunification	REUNIFICATION; HOME	Despite the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) more than four decades ago, little is known about how or how well it is being implemented into practice by the state courts or how implementation may be related to improved outcomes for Indian children and families. This study explores how ICWA implementation in five state court sites is related to case outcomes. One hundred and fifty-one ICWA cases were reviewed for factors including active efforts findings, tribal presence at hearings, use of qualified expert witness (QEW) testimony, notice, and confirmation of ICWA status. Results are mixed. Specific ICWA implementation measures and aggregate measures were mostly not related to outcomes, but early implementation, such as having the tribe present at the first hearing, did appear related to timely permanency. Implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.

And like other facets of biodiversity, declines in many butterfly populations appear related to human activities, and the potential of their extinction could jeopardize key ecosystem services. The regal fritillary (Argynnis idalia), a butterfly associated with tall- and mixed-grass prairies in the United States, is a species currently being considered for federal protection under the Endangered Species Act. As with many butterflies, a paucity of data makes evidence-based assessments of their population and distributional status difficult. Citizen science data provide one possible source of broadscale information about this species, but using these data is not simple because of spatial scaling and sampling bias problems. Here, we developed a model to analyze a data set from the citizen science program called the Fourth of July Butterfly Count (4JC) to make inferences about regal fritillary abundance in the Great Plains and Midwest regions of the United States. More specifically, we aimed to determine the extent to which grassland fragmentation, spring weather conditions, or other spatial factors were correlated with the intensity of use within 4JC survey areas. Our findings indicated that regal fritillaries used locations surrounded by grassland and with minimal forest cover. We included smoothing spline terms in our model, which indicated other sources of spatial structuring in these data. It is possible that these additional sources of variation could reflect variation in habitat quality. We also found that local averaged spring weather variables indicated that regal fritillary abundance varied over a wider range of precipitation conditions, but a narrower range of temperature conditions. Further analyses indicated that a systematic increase in temperature from climate change could lead to a pronounced northward shift in the regal fritillary's distribution. These findings have implications for the development of a recovery plan, since such a plan will need to outline a strategy that accounts for a range of patch sizes whose quality appears to vary spatially, as well as address numerous uncertainties about the future.

This study is not only analyzing the plan quality by utilizing the plan parameters and indexes but also compares treatment modalities from the protocol implementation. Method and materialTwenty-five patients treated in the period from February 2020 to September 2022 were recruited in this analysis. Two planners randomly selected the patients and modalities. The modalities employed were Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Helical Tomotherapy (HT). Various parameters and indexes were used to access not only the plan quality but also to compare each modality. The parameters and indexes studied were the homogeneity index (HI), conformity index (CI), gradient distance (GD), and the dose received by the organs at risk. ResultThe data reveals that the mean volume of PTV is 60.8 +/- 53.9 cc where these targets exhibit no significant difference between each modality. The HI shows a consistent value for both modalities. Between each modality, the CI value shows less deviation, but the HT shows slightly higher performance than VMAT. The value of GD is 1.5 +/- 0.3 cm where the HT provides a shorter distance compared to VMAT as well. ConclusionThe parameters and indexes should be utilized for the plan evaluation although in the guidelines this was not required. Various modalities were employed for treatment. Both can achieve the treatment criteria with slightly low performance of VMAT.

The reaction with SiX4 leads to the hexacoordinate silanes SiX2(BAP)(2) in which BAP(-) is coordinated in the chelating kappa(2)-O,O ' mode, analogously to acac(-). Unexpectedly, the coordination behaviour of BAP(-) differs from the one of acac(-) in the interpnictogen compounds E(BAP)(3) (E=As, Sb) in which the formation of E-P bonds is favoured over kappa(2)-O,O ' chelation via the oxygen centres. Finally, the reaction of BiCl3 with three equivalents of Na(BAP) leads to the formation of red, crystalline Bi-2(BAP)(4), an air stable dibismuthine, as product of a redox reaction.

Machine learning confirms new records of maniraptoran theropods in Middle Jurassic UK microvertebrate faunas	PAPERS IN PALAEONTOLOGY			English	Article						Maniraptora; Theropoda; Middle Jurassic; teeth; machine learning	DINOSAURIA THEROPODA; TEETH; IDENTIFICATION; PALEONTOLOGY; OSTEOLOGY; BAJOCIAN; SKYE; STRATIGRAPHY; OXFORDSHIRE; VERTEBRATES	Current research suggests that the initial radiation of maniraptoran theropods occurred in the Middle Jurassic, although their fossil record is known almost exclusively from the Cretaceous. However, fossils of Jurassic maniraptorans are scarce, usually consisting solely of isolated teeth, and their identifications are often disputed. Here, we apply different machine learning models, in conjunction with morphological comparisons, to a suite of isolated theropod teeth from Bathonian microvertebrate sites in the UK to determine whether any of these can be confidently assigned to Maniraptora. We generated three independent models developed on a training dataset with a wide range of theropod taxa and broad geographical and temporal coverage. Classification of the Middle Jurassic teeth in our sample against these models and comparison of the morphology indicates the presence of at least three distinct dromaeosaur morphotypes, plus a therizinosaur and troodontid in these assemblages. These new referrals significantly extend the ranges of Therizinosauroidea and Troodontidae by some 27 myr. These results indicate that not only were maniraptorans present in the Middle Jurassic, as predicted by previous phylogenetic analyses, but they had already radiated into a diverse fauna that pre-dated the break-up of Pangaea. This study also demonstrates the power of machine learning to provide quantitative assessments of isolated teeth in providing a robust, testable framework for taxonomic identifications, and highlights the importance of assessing and including evidence from microvertebrate sites in faunal and evolutionary analyses.

Accordingly, based on long-term runoff observations obtained using diverse runoff techniques (i.e., rating curves and fluvial acoustic tomography (FAT)), the authors (1) evaluated and explored flood phenomena, (2) discussed the effects of dams on flood hydrograph, (3) and revealed backwater effects caused by river channel bends, sand bars, and floodplains. The duration and slope of the falling limb of the hydrograph were directly influenced by the catchment characteristics that affected runoff recession, whereas the behaviour of the rising limb of the hydrograph was directly influenced by rainfall. A weaker correlation between discharge and rainfall in higher flood events indicates that rainfall events were strongly altered by water released from dams in the basin. Additionally, because of the backwater effects, the rate at which the flow velocity and boundary shear stress changed with the increasing discharge was reduced, potentially slowing the pace of erosion. Our findings are relevant for managing mountain rivers, particularly in river bend reaches prone to backwater effects. The FAT method could help increase the ability to monitor short-term fluctuations in floods and associated hazards.

Factors that shape large-scale gradients in clonality	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						biogeography; clonal growth and reproduction; functional trait; growth form; net primary productivity; plant-climate interactions; precipitation; soil; solar radiation; temperature	EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; GLOBAL PATTERNS; SEED SIZE; R-PACKAGE; PLANT; TRAITS; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; PERSISTENCE	Aim: Many plant species reproduce clonally. However, ecologists still have much to learn about the factors that shape large-scale patterns in plant clonal growth and reproduction, especially in the southern hemisphere. We addressed this knowledge gap by quantifying relationships between reproductive mode and a suite of plant characteristics and environmental variables.Location: Australia.Taxon: Spermatophytes.Methods: We used data for 914,456 species-site combinations (including 4116 unique species) in Australia to quantify the bivariate relationships between the probability of species having clonal reproduction and four plant characteristics and 16 environmental variables, using phylogenetic logistic regressions. We also compared the relative effects across plant characteristics and environmental variables groups through principal component analysis and phylogenetic logistic regressions.Results: The probability of species having clonal reproduction was much more strongly related to plant characteristics than to environmental variables. Short, herbaceous plants and monocots were more likely to have clonal reproduction and were more common in environments with low temperatures, low solar radiation, high moisture availability, high net primary productivity (NPP) and high soil organic carbon and nitrogen contents. Tall, woody plants and eudicots tended to have only sexual reproduction, and were more common in dry and soil impoverished environments.Main conclusions: Our results advance the understanding of the factors that shape large-scale patterns in plant reproduction strategy. For example, the fact that clonality is more common in shorter, herbaceous species suggests that clonality can be added to the suite of traits that align species on the fast-slow continuum. The fact that clonal reproduction is more tightly correlated with moisture availability, NPP and soil nutrients than climatic extremes and variations suggests that clonal reproduction may be better understood as a strategy for population expansion in resource abundant sites than as a strategy for reproductive assurance under environmental stress.

A growing number of symmetric cryptography algorithms have been attacked in the quantum setting. Type-3 generalized Feistel scheme (GFS) and unbalanced Feistel scheme with expanding functions (UFS-E) are common symmetric cryptography schemes, which are often used in cryptographic analysis and design. We propose quantum distinguishing attacks on Type-3 GFS and UFS-E in the quantum chosen plaintext attack setting. The results of key recovery are better than those based on exhaustive search in the quantum setting.

However, the functions and mechanisms of METTL3 in pathogenic T helper (Th)17 cells are poorly understood. Here we found significantly decreased METTL3 expression along with reduced m6A levels in eyeballs and T cells of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Overexpression of METTL3 ameliorated the development of EAU and suppressed pathogenic Th17 cell responses in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, METTL3 promoted the expression of absent, small, or homeotic-like 1 (ASH1L) via enhancing its stability in a YT521-B homology domain containing 2 (YTHDC2)-dependent manner, which further decreased the expression of IL-17 and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), resulting in reduced pathogenic Th17 responses. Together, our data reveal a pivotal role of METTL3 in regulating pathogenic Th17 responses, which may contribute to human uveitis therapy.

A study based on density functional theory calculations, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							GAS-PHASE BASICITIES; PROTON AFFINITIES; COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY; REACTIVITY; TOOL; FRAGMENTATION; SPECTRA	RationaleOxazolines are important compounds for drug development, synthesis, and pharmaceutical applications. Interest in analyzing and developing methods to characterize reaction products from these small heterocyclics has led us to study the gas-phase reactivity and fragmentation of seven 2-arene-2-oxazolines compounds using computational chemistry combined with mass spectrometry. MethodProtonation sites were investigated using computed proton affinity, gas-phase basicity, and some quantum chemistry descriptors of reactivity; the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) computational model was used. Fragmentation mechanisms were suggested by employing data from collision-induced dissociation (CID), energy-resolved plots from MS/MS spectra, multiple-stage experiments, and survival-yield method. ResultsProtonation studies based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and computational thermochemistry were useful to describe the reactivity of the investigated 2-arene-2-oxazolines, which can be protonated at the nitrogen atom. Three major fragmentation pathways were identified for the protonated molecules: formation of (a) benzoylium or (b) nitrilium ions through elimination of 71 and 72 u from the protonated molecules, respectively, and (c) elimination of 54 u from [M+H](+). These pathways were exploited by the density functional theory calculations combined with QTAIM studies. ConclusionsOur results can help in identifying 2-arene-2-oxazoline derivatives using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS), which can be applied for monitoring reactions through the identified diagnostic ions (product ions). Also, we can suggest that benzoylium and nitrilium ions emerge during fragmentation under CID conditions.

Conducting polymers (CPs), as one of the most promising materials used in Li-S batteries, can not only facilitate electron transfer and buffer the large volumetric change of sulfur benefiting from their porous structure and excellent flexibility, but also enable stronger physical/chemical adsorption capacity toward polysulfides (LiPSs) when doped with abundant heteroatoms to promote the sulfur redox kinetics and achieve the high sulfur loading. This review firstly introduces the properties of various CPs including structural CPs (polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANi), polyethylene dioxothiophene [PEDOT]) and compound CPs (polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) [PAA]), and their application potential in Li-S batteries. Furthermore, the research progress of various CPs in different components (cathode, separator, and interlayer) of Li-S batteries is systematically summarized. Finally, the application perspective of the CPs in Li-S batteries as a potential guidance is comprehensively discussed.

Recent work has shown that tissues taken from legs, antennae or abdomen of lobsters can give different indications of diet, but this has never been evaluated for Sagmariasus verreauxi (eastern rock lobster). Work is now needed to prevent erroneous conclusions being drawn about lobster food webs, and undertaking this work could lead to developing non-lethal sampling methodologies. Non-lethal sampling for lobsters is valuable both ethically and for areas of conservation significance such as marine reserves. MethodWe evaluated this by dissecting 76 lobsters and comparing delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope values in antennae, leg and abdomen tissue from the same individuals ranging from 104 to 137 mm carapace length. Stable isotope values were determined using a Europa EA GSL elemental analyser coupled with Hydra 20-20 Isoprime IRMS. ResultsWe found the abdomen delta C-13 values to be lower than other tissues by 0.3 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand for antennae tissue and 0.1 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand delta C-13 for leg tissues, whereas for delta N-15, no significant difference between tissues was observed. There was no significant effect of lobster size or sex, though we did observe interactions between month and tissue type, indicating that differences may be seasonal. Importantly, the detected range of isotopic variability between tissues is within the range of uncertainty used for discrimination factors in isotopic Bayesian modelling of 0 parts per thousand-1.0 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 3.0 parts per thousand-4.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15. ConclusionsWe show that S. verreauxi can be sampled non-lethally with mathematical corrections applied for delta C-13, whereas any tissue is suitable for delta N-15. Our results indicate that a walking leg is most favourable and would also be the least intrusive for the lobster. The application of non-lethal sampling provides avenues for the contribution of citizen science to understanding lobster food webs and to undertake fieldwork in ecologically sensitive areas such as marine reserves.

Cases were included if their mode of separation from ED indicated admission to an in-patient unit including critical care ward and their ED length of stay was greater than or equal to 24 h. Cases were categorised by service-related groups based on principle diagnosis.Results: A total of 26 854 eligible cases were identified. The most com-mon diagnosis groups were psychia-try, cardiology and respiratory. The odds ratio (OR) for 30-day all-cause mortality in admitted patients with an ED length of stay greater than 24 h were highest in those aged > 75 years (OR 15.18, 95% confi-dence interval [CI] 9.99-23.07, P < 0.001), oncology (OR 10.45, 95% CI 7.93-13.77, P < 0.001) and haematology patients (OR 2.95, 95% CI 2.01-4.33, P < 0.001).Conclusion: Interventions and models of care to address ED access block need to focus on mental health patients, older patients particularly those with cardiorespiratory illness and oncology and haematology patients for whom risk of mortality is disproportionately higher.

The effects of aluminum-lanthanum ratio, co-precipitation time, hydrothermal time, and hydrothermal temperature on the crystal structure were studied. As a result, the optimum condition was found to be: n(Al3+): n(La3+) = 10:1, co-precipitation time 24 h, hydrothermal time 8 h, and hydrothermal temperature 180?. The influence of ZnAlLa-itaconate-LDHs on the thermal stability properties and plasticizing properties of PVC were investigated, exhibiting long-term stability of 76 min with short plasticizing time of 1.11 min. Long-term thermal stability mechanism was studied by FTIR before and after hydrochloric acid treatment. It was demonstrated that the thermal stabilizer ZnAlLa-itaconate-LDHs prevented the rupture of the C-Cl bond in PVC and inhibited the development of HCl. Consequently, impeded the production of C(sic)C bond and playing a role in thermal stabilization of PVC.

Tuneable Piezoresistance of Graphene-Based 2D:2D Nanocomposite Networks	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						graphene; nanocomposites; percolation; piezoresistivity; strain sensors	IN-SITU MEASUREMENT; STRAIN SENSOR; CARBON NANOTUBE; SENSITIVITY; FILMS; SIZE; THICKNESS; ROLES	Piezoresistive nanocomposites are an important class of materials that allow the production of very sensitive strain sensors. Herein, a new class of piezoresistive nanocomposites prepared by mixing different types of 2D nanosheets is explored. In this way, three distinct types of nanocomposite are produced by mixing conducting and insulating nanosheets (graphene, Gr and boron nitride, BN), conducting and semiconducting nanosheets (graphene and tungsten diselenide, WSe2 or tungsten disulfide, WS2) as well as mixing two different types of conducting nanosheets (graphene and silver, Ag). For each nanocomposite type, a different dependence of composite conductivity on filler volume fraction is observed although all behaviors can be fully described by percolation theory. In addition, each composite type shows different piezoresistive properties. Interestingly, while the conductor insulator composites show the standard monotonic relationship between gauge factor and conductivity, both conductor:semi-conductor and conductor:conductor composites show very unusual behavior, in each case displaying a peak engage factor at the percolation threshold. In each case, percolation theory is used to develop simple equations for gauge factor as a function of both volume fraction and conductivity that fully describes all experimental data. This work expands the understanding of piezoresistive nanocomposites and provides a platform for the engineering of high-performance strain sensors.

PCL and surfactant concentration were optimized to get fine NF. The morphological study of the NF was carried out by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy. The structural changes were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, and its elemental mapping was analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray mapping. The addition of surfactants altered the morphology of PCL NFs and improved their physiochemical properties, such as wettability, roughness and crystallinity. Among these two surfactants, AOT gave a better NF structure. In the presence of AOT, the hydroalcoholic extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) was incorporated as the herbal drug, and antibacterial behavior against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was monitored. The novelty of this work was in the use of a surfactant as a cospinning agent for dual purposes in a single step. The surfactant changed the hydrophobic PCL into a superhydrophilic matrix and incorporated herbal extract to develop an infection-resistance nanofiber. The developed PCL/TA nanofiber showed excellent potential as an antimicrobial agent with antioxidant properties.

However, the large volume change as well as stress generates during its lithiation-delithiation process poses a great challenge to the long-term cycling and hindering its application. Herein this work, a composite binder is prepared with a soft component, guar gum (GG), and a rigid linear polymer, anionic polyacrylamide (APAM). Rich hydroxy, carboxyl, and amide groups on the polymer chains not only enable intermolecular crosslinking to form a web-like binder, A2G1, but also realize strong chemical binding as well as physical encapsulating to Si particles. The resultant electrode shows limited thickness change of merely 9% on lithiation and almost recovers its original thickness on delithiation. It demonstrates high reversible capacity of 2104.3 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 1800 mA g(-1), and in constant capacity (1000 mAh g(-1)) test, it also shows a long life of 392 cycles. Therefore, this soft-hard combining web-like binder illustrates its great potential in the future applications.

J	Li, S; Wang, HJ				Li, Shuang; Wang, Haijun			Robust irreversible investment strategy with ambiguity to jump and diffusion risk	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCE			English	Article						ambiguity; irreversible investment; jump-diffusion risk; optimal investment boundary; the value of investment opportunity	PORTFOLIO CHOICE; MODEL; REINSURANCE; UNCERTAINTY; INSURER; RULES	This paper constructs a robust and irreversible investment rule applicable to a series of adjacent models. The project value follows a jump-diffusion process and the investor exhibits complete ambiguity aversion or partial ambiguity aversion to the diffusion, jump amplitude, and jump frequency components. The impact of ambiguity aversion with respect to different components on the optimal investment strategy is examined. The investment decision is mainly driven by ambiguity aversion to the jump amplitude rather than frequency, and an increase in jump intensity leads to the greater importance of ambiguity aversion to jumps. We further show that ambiguity aversion regarding jumps plays a dominant role in determining the investment boundary for low volatility values, and the influence of ambiguity aversion to the diffusion part gradually outweighs that of ambiguity aversion to jumps as volatility grows.

Texture Inpainting for Photogrammetric Models	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article						rendering; texture mapping; modelling; surface parameterization; texture synthesis	IMAGE; PARAMETERIZATION	We devise a technique designed to remove the texturing artefacts that are typical of 3D models representing real-world objects, acquired by photogrammetric techniques. Our technique leverages the recent advancements in inpainting of natural colour images, adapting them to the specific context. A neural network, modified and trained for our purposes, replaces the texture areas containing the defects, substituting them with new plausible patches of texels, reconstructed from the surrounding surface texture. We train and apply the network model on locally reparametrized texture patches, so to provide an input that simplifies the learning process, because it avoids any texture seams, unused texture areas, background, depth jumps and so on. We automatically extract appropriate training data from real-world datasets. We show two applications of the resulting method: one, as a fully automatic tool, addressing all problems that can be detected by analysing the UV-map of the input model; and another, as an interactive semi-automatic tool, presented to the user as a 3D 'fixing' brush that has the effect of removing artefacts from any zone the users paints on. We demonstrate our method on a variety of real-world inputs and provide a reference usable implementation.

The objective was to determine whether patients with musculoskeletal pain have poorer prognosis following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stroke.Methods: The study utilised UK electronic primary care records (CPRD Aurum) with linkage to hospital and mortality records. Patients aged >= 45 years admitted to hospital with incident ACS/stroke were categorised by healthcare use for musculoskeletal pain (inflammatory conditions, osteoarthritis [OA], and regional pain) based on primary care consultations in the prior 24 months. Outcomes included mortality, length of stay, readmission and management of index condition (ACS/stroke).Results: There were 171,670 patients with incident ACS and 138,512 with stroke; 30% consulted for musculoskeletal pain prior to ACS/stroke and these patients had more comorbidity than those without musculoskeletal pain. Rates of mortality and readmission, and length of stay were higher in those with musculoskeletal pain, particularly OA and inflammatory conditions, in ACS. Readmission was also higher for patients with musculoskeletal pain in stroke. However, increased risks associated with musculoskeletal pain did not remain after adjustment for age and polypharmacy. Inflammatory conditions were associated with increased likelihood of prescriptions for dual anti-platelets (ACS only) and anti-coagulants.Conclusions: Patients with musculoskeletal pain have higher rates of poor outcome from ACS which relates to being older but also increased polypharmacy. The high rates of comorbidity including polypharmacy highlight the complexity of patients with musculoskeletal pain who have new onset ACS/stroke.

An unanswered question in this field is the time point during the life-course at which an individual becomes predisposed to frailty. Here, we propose that frailty has a fetal origin and should be regarded as part of the spectrum of the developmental origins of health and disease. The developmental origins of health and disease theory originated from findings linking the fetal environment to lifestyle-related disorders such as hypertension and diabetes. Coincidentally, a recent trend in frailty research also centers on vascular dysfunction and metabolic alterations as the causality of lifestyle-related disorders such as sarcopenia and dementia. Here, we explore the relationship between fetal programming, frailty-related disorders (sarcopenia and dementia), and other age-related diseases mainly based on reports on intrauterine growth restriction. We propose a "total" life-course approach to combat frailty. With this viewpoint, not only physicians and gerontologists but also obstetricians and pediatricians should team up to overcome age-related diseases in the elderly.

Similarly, spatial neglect, a disabling deficit in unilateral spatial processing, is more common and more severe following a right-sided stroke. Spatial neglect has been established as a risk factor for delirium. ObjectiveIt was hypothesized that functionally relevant spatial neglect and delirium are associated in patients with right-hemisphere stroke during acute inpatient rehabilitation. Data were examined from consecutive unilateral stroke patients evaluated with the 3-minute diagnostic interview for confusion assessment method (3D-CAM) and the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS) via the Kessler Foundation Neglect Assessment Process (KF-NAP). DesignA retrospective, cohort study. SettingData collected in an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility. ParticipantsSix hundred twenty six patients with stroke were included. Main Outcome MeasuresThe measures were the relative risk of patients with right-hemisphere stroke having delirium when also positive for spatial neglect compared to patients with right-hemisphere stroke without spatial neglect, the incidence of 3D-CAM positive results by stroke hemisphere, and the effect of spatial neglect and delirium on functional outcomes for patients with right-brain stroke patients. ResultsThere was a significantly higher risk of delirium in patients with right-hemisphere stroke with spatial neglect compared to patients with right-hemisphere stroke without spatial neglect. The rates of 3D-CAM positive results were not statistically different for left-compared to right-hemisphere strokes. Both delirium and spatial neglect had significant adverse effects on right-hemisphere stroke patients' functional independence. ConclusionsThe results demonstrate an association between spatial neglect and delirium in patients with right hemisphere stroke in the acute inpatient rehabilitation setting. Because of the negative effect of these impairments on functional outcomes after stroke, prevention, early detection, and targeted treatments should be prioritized for these patients.

J	Purves, A				Purves, Andrew			Singapore's Imminent Expiration of Land Leases: From Growth and Equality to Discontent and Inequality?	TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE			English	Article; Early Access						land rent theory; Singapore; inequality; lease expiry; housing tenure		Haila described Singapore as a laboratory for a social scientist given the multiple ways land is used, managed or treated as a source of public revenue. Phang explains how housing has given the bottom 50 per cent of households, wealth equating to the level advocated in Piketty's 'ideal society'. As fixed-term leases expire, people who own apartments on public land will see their values fall to zero. Inequality will return, challenging the otherwise stable polity. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper explores how and why this unique land regime was created, and expose how theoretically inconsistent policies and their ad hoc, pragmatic application has created several rent leakages to a minority of the population who continue to hold freehold land. It offers some alternative strategies better informed by land rent theory, that might be adopted to preserve the benefits enjoyed for now.

In general, NRP-1 overexpression in cancer correlates with poor prognosis and more tumor aggressiveness. NRP-1 role in cancer has been mainly explained by mediating VEGF-A165-induced effects on tumor angiogenesis. NRP-1 was recently identified as a co-receptor and an independent gateway for SARS-CoV-2 through binding subunit S2 of Spike protein in the same way as VEGF-A165. Thus, NRP-1 is of particular value as a target for cancer therapy and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases as well as for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral intervention. Herein, The Super Natural II, the largest available database of natural products (similar to 0.33 M), pre-filtered with drug-likeness criteria (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion/toxicity), was screened against NRP-1. NRP-1/VEGF-A165 interaction is one of protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) known to be challenging when approached in-silico. Thus, a PPI-suited multi-step virtual screening protocol, incorporating a derived pharmacophore with molecular docking and followed by MD (molecular dynamics) simulation, was designed. Two stages of pharmacophorically constrained molecular docking (standard and extra precisions), a mixed Torsional/Low-mode conformational search and MM-GBSA Delta G binding affinities calculation, resulted in the selection of 100 hits. These 100 hits were subjected to 20 ns MD simulation, that was extended to 100 ns for top hits (20) and followed by post-dynamics analysis (atomic ligand-protein contacts, RMSD, RMSF, MM-GBSA Delta G, Rg, SASA and H-bonds). Post-MD analysis showed that 19 small drug-like nonpeptide natural molecules, grouped in four chemical scaffolds (purine, thiazole, tetrahydropyrimidine and dihydroxyphenyl), well verified the derived pharmacophore and formed stable and compact complexes with NRP-1. The discovered molecules are promising and can serve as a base for further development of new NRP-1 inhibitors.

MethodsTCMSP, CTD, STITCH, SymMap, GeneCard, GenBank, OMIM and DrugBank databases were used to obtain the components and targets of CS and the targets of chloasma. STRING was used to build a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of intersecting targets between drugs and diseases. Cytoscape was used to establish drug-compounds-targets-disease network and analyze PPI network. R was used for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and visualization. AutoDock was used for molecular docking and R was used to visualize docking results. ResultsFour active compounds were screened out from CS, and 31 target genes intersecting with melasma were found after further analysis. The top 10 hub genes were found after analysis of the PPI network, including TYR, TYRP1, DCT, CREB1, KITLG, MITF, ESR1, EDNRB, CD4, and PTGS2. In the enrichment analysis, melanogenesis was considered as the core pathway through which CS exerts its therapeutic effect on melasma. Molecular docking results showed that the core genes in the regulatory network had high binding activity with related active components, especially crocetin. ConclusionCS may treat melasma by regulating core targets, such as TYR, TYRP1, DCT, CREB1, KITLG, MITF, EDNRB, and PTGS2, and acting on melanogenesis. And crocetin may be the core compound worthy of further study.

In this work, we reported the synthesis of nitrogen-doped MnO2 (N-MnO2) to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts for air cathode in ZABs. The doped N atoms here introduced more Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies for MnO2, enhancing charge transfer property and accelerating surface intermediate product during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Hence, the best N-MnO2 achieved remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards ORR (half-wave potential of 0.797 V vs. RHE), and reversible oxygen overpotential of around 0.842 V, which is better than or comparable to the Pt/C and Mn-based catalysts reported recently. Moreover, the homemade ZABs based on N-MnO2 showed the maximum power density of 132.8 mW cm(-2) and excellent cyclic stability.

Growth directly onto the metal foil current collector forms sulfur-deficient SnS microrod structures via a vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism, with 92 nm average SnS crystallite size and an 800 nm film thickness. The sulfur deficiency is demonstrated with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, powder X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses. This sulfur-deficient SnS material demonstrates a very high capacity in sodium half cells. The first reduction scan at a specific current of 150 mA g(-1) shows a capacity of 1084 mAh g(-1). At the 50th cycle the specific capacity is 638 mAh g(-1) for reduction and 593 mAh g(-1) for oxidation. This capacity is demonstrated for tin sulfide itself without the need for a nanostructured carbon support, unlike previous high capacity SnS anodes in the literature. Both the capacity and ex situ characterization experiments indicate a conversion reaction producing tin, followed by alloying with sodium during reduction, and that both of these processes are reversible during oxidation.

Community -based conservation is a widely adopted wildlife governance approach, but questions remain about the conditions under which this form of wildlife governance achieves success. Particularly, participating communities are often marked by considerable wealth and risk heterogeneities that are driven by differences in livestock or agricultural holdings and varying exposure to wildlife depredation of those holdings.2. The effect of these types of heterogeneity on successful conservation collective action is understudied, particularly in the case of risk heterogeneity. This lacuna limits policymakers' ability to effectively match the design of community -based programs to their particular settings.3. Using established behavioural experimental techniques, we model the incentive structures underlying community -based wildlife conservation where actors differ in wealth and exposure to human- wildlife conflict. We conduct a modified binary linear voluntary contribution mechanism game, in which we vary subject endowments and risk of incurring a loss when participating in collective action and we find that the type of heterogeneity matters to collective action success.4. On their own, the presence of either economic or risk heterogeneities (but not both) dampen cooperation compared with homogeneous groups, as do "balanced' distributions of both heterogeneities (where individuals facing high risk levels receive high endowments and vice versa). However, groups with "unbalanced' heterogeneities (where those facing high risk levels receive low endowments and vice versa) demonstrate cooperation at similar levels to that of homogeneous groups.5. At the individual level, risk drives cooperative behaviour, although its impact is influenced by relative wealth levels when both forms of heterogeneity are present.6. These findings suggest the need for a more in -depth look at the role and interaction of risk and wealth heterogeneities in conservation management.

Building on their proof, in this paper we prove that the MaxCut problem is NP-complete on permutation graphs. This settles a long-standing open problem that appeared in the 1985 column of the Ongoing Guide to NP-completeness by David S. Johnson, and is the first NP-hardness entry for permutation graphs in such column.	[de Figueiredo, Celina M.

Market structure and resilience of food supply chains under extreme events	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						correlated shocks; extreme shocks; food supply chains; market structure; supply chain resilience	RETAIL PRICE SPREAD; ECONOMIES; POWER; CONSOLIDATION; SECTOR; SCALE	Recent extreme events and the disruptions they caused have made food supply chain resilience a key topic for researchers and policymakers. This paper provides input into these discussions by evaluating the efficiency and resilience properties of the leading policy proposals. We develop a conceptual model of a prototype agricultural supply chain, parameterize the model based on the empirical literature, and conduct simulations to assess the impacts on resilience and economic welfare of four key policy proposals: (i) intensified antitrust enforcement to improve market competition, (ii) subsidization of entry of additional processing capacity, (iii) prevention of price spikes through anti-price-gouging laws, and (iv) diversification of production and processing across multiple regions. Results show that some of the policies have potential to improve supply-chain resilience, but their impacts depend on the existing market structure, and resilience gains often come at the cost of reduced efficiency.

Based on the power distribution of light-duty vehicles, this study developed a fuel consumption model for HDV and CAV mixed platoons by theoretical hypothesis considering the oscillation along with the platoon. Firstly, a vehicle-specific power (VSP) distribution conforming to normal distribution is constructed with hypothesis-based VSP standard deviation and constant VSP average value at each speed bin under different platoon arrangement conditions. Then, the fuel factors (mL/km) are calculated by weighted fuel rate (mL/s) according to the VSP distribution. Finally, a library of fuel consumption values for multiple penetration rates, platoon intensities, and speeds was established. In the case, at a speed of 30 km/h, the fuel consumption in the CAV group was reduced by 0.8-5%, 1.9-12.5%, 8.6-12%, and 12.4%, respectively, at the penetration rate of 20%, 50%, 80%, and 100%, compared to the HDV group. The fuel consumption reduction effect of CAV was negatively correlated with the speed.

As such, it is difficult to make a rapid diagnosis. ObjectiveTo investigate changes in pulse oxygen saturation in patients with chronic heart failure and examine the relationship between B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and normal pulse oxygen saturation. MethodsA total of 80 hospitalized patients with chronic heart failure and increased BNP were randomly selected as the study group; the family members of 60 patients without dyspnea were randomly selected as the control group. The researchers measured the value of pulse oxygen saturation before and after upper arm compression, calculating the difference and analyzing the correlation between this difference and BNP values. The data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS Statistics 17.0 program. ResultsThe decrease in pulse oxygen saturation in the study group was greater than in the control group; the decrease in pulse oxygen saturation of patients with chronic heart failure positively correlated with BNP. ConclusionThe value of pulse oxygen saturation in patients with chronic heart failure decreased more than in the control group, and this difference positively correlated with BNP. The measurement of pulse oxygen saturation before and after upper arm compression is a simple and effective method for diagnosing and evaluating chronic heart failure.

Framework for facilitating mangrove recovery after hurricanes on Caribbean islands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						ecological mangrove restoration; EMR; genetic considerations; hydrogeomorphic type; regeneration; resiliency bottlenecks; tropical cyclones	STRUCTURED DECISION-MAKING; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; RHIZOPHORA-MANGLE; RED MANGROVE; FORESTS; REHABILITATION; PRACTITIONERS; OBJECTIVES; ECOSYSTEM	Mangrove ecosystems in the Caribbean are frequently exposed to hurricanes, leading to structural and regenerative change that elicit calls for recovery action. For those mangroves unaffected by human modifications, recovery can occur naturally. Indeed, observable natural recovery after hurricanes is the genesis of the "disturbance adaptation" classification for mangroves; while structural legacies exist, unaltered stands often regenerate and persist. However, among the >7,000 islands, islets, and cays that make up the Caribbean archipelago, coastal alterations to support development affect mechanisms for regeneration, sediment distribution, tidal water conveyance, and intertidal mangrove transgression, imposing sometimes insurmountable barriers to natural post-hurricane recovery. We use a case study approach to suggest that actions to facilitate recovery of mangroves on Caribbean islands (and similar settings globally) may be more effective when focusing on ameliorating pre-existing anthropogenic stressors. Actions to clean debris, collect mangrove propagules, and plant seedlings are noble endeavors, but can be costly and fall short of achieving recovery goals in isolation without careful consideration of pre-hurricane stress. We update a procedural framework that considers six steps to implementing "Ecological Mangrove Restoration" (EMR), and we apply them specifically to hurricane recovery. If followed, EMR may expedite actions by suggesting immediate damage assessment focused on hydrogeomorphic mangrove type, hydrology, and previous anthropogenic (or natural) influence. Application of EMR may help to improve mangrove recovery success following catastrophic storms, and reduce guesswork, delays, and monetary inefficiencies.

ObjectiveTo synthesize and evaluate evidence from systematic reviews examining the effectiveness and outcomes of patient-targeted opioid deprescribing interventions for all types of pain. MethodsSystematic searches were conducted in five databases with results screened against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Primary outcomes were (i) reduction in opioid dose, reported as change in oral Morphine Equivalent Daily Dose (oMEDD) and (ii) success of opioid deprescribing, reported as the proportion of the sample for which opioid use declined. Secondary outcomes included pain severity, physical function, quality of life and adverse events. The certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. FindingsTwelve reviews were eligible for inclusion. Interventions were heterogeneous in nature and included pharmacological (n = 4), physical (n = 3), procedural (n = 3), psychological or behavioural (n = 3) and mixed (n = 5) interventions. Multidisciplinary care programmes appeared to be the most effective intervention for opioid deprescribing; however, the certainty of evidence was low, with significant variability in opioid reduction across interventions. ConclusionsEvidence is too uncertain to draw firm conclusions about specific populations who may derive the greatest benefit from opioid deprescribing, warranting further investigation.

This article casts research questions on how organizational capabilities and resources affect strategy implementation, and how the implementation differs by strategic type. To address the climate change problem, local governments mobilize and allocate capabilities and resources and implement policy actions. Utilizing Miles and Snow's strategic typology, the article examines the factors for variation in implementation patterns among cities, with some implementing policies as "defenders" and others as "prospectors" across multiple policy domains. Analysis of energy policy action data from US cities reveals the distinct capabilities and resources required for the implementation of each strategic type.

Plasticity in resource use explains the persistence of the largest living rodent in anthropized environments	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						diet; dietary niche; feeding habits; Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris; human-modified landscapes; stable isotopes; optimal foraging	CAPYBARA HYDROCHOERUS-HYDROCHAERIS; PARANA RIVER; LOWER DELTA; PATTERNS; CATTLE; FOREST; RANGE	How organisms search for and obtain food is a determinant of their survival. It has been hypothesized that organisms facing food limitations might expand their dietary niche compared with optimal foraging conditions. Nonetheless, some organisms may reduce their dietary niche due to limiting resources. Here, we show the resource use plasticity of capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the largest living rodent, in natural and anthropized environments of Brazil using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in hair. We assessed the resource use, size and overlap of isotopic niches, and the influence of body mass, age class, sex, and landscape composition on isotopic values among 13 capybara populations (210 individuals). We observed a wide variation in isotopic values of capybaras among and within populations in different environments. Surprisingly, diets varied from strictly C-4-based to strictly C-3-based, with most individuals feeding on C-4 plants (65%). A substantial portion of individuals presented mixed diets (C-3 and C-4 plants), totaling 31% of the individuals, and few fed exclusively on C-3 plants (4%). Isotopic niche size also varied among populations in both environments, with low overlap considering their core dietary niche. Capybara populations in natural environments had substantial incorporation of C-3 resources, showing individuals with strictly C-3 diets, and possibly relying on a high diversity of food items, while some populations in anthropized ones fed exclusively on C-4 resources. Neither body mass, age class, sex, nor landscape composition significantly influenced isotopic values. Here, we provide evidence of the dietary plasticity of capybaras in different environments, transitioning from the consumption of C-4 to C-3 plants when needed, that is, from preferred to non-preferred food items. Together with the species' behavioral plasticity, our results help explain its resilience in surviving, and even thriving, in both natural and human-modified environments.	[Magioli, M.; Ferraz, K. M.

However, this catheter's detailed characteristics of the lesion formation are unknown. MethodsWith an in vitro model, TactiFlex SE and its predecessor, FlexAbility SE, were used. A cross-sectional analysis of 60 s lesions (combination of various energy power settings [30, 40, and 50 W], and CFs [10, 30, and 50 g]) and longitudinal analysis (combination of various powers [40 or 50 W], CFs [10, 30, and 50 g] and ablation times [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 s]) of both catheters were analyzed and compared. ResultsOne hundred eighty RF lesions were created in protocol 1 and 300 in protocol 2. The lesion formation, impedance changes, and steam pops characteristics were similar between the two catheters. Higher CFs were related to higher incidences of steam pops. A nonlinear, time-dependent increase in the lesion depth and diameter was observed for all power and CF settings, and linear, positive correlations between the RF delivery time and lesion volume were observed for all power settings. Compared with 40 W, a 50 W ablation created greater lesions. Longer durations with higher CF settings had a higher steam pop incidence. ConclusionsThe lesion formation and incidence of steam pops with TactiFlex SE and FlexAbility SE were similar. A 40 or 50 W ablation with careful CF control not to exceed 30 g in addition to monitoring impedance drops was required to safely create transmural lesions.

Baseline blood biomarker concentrations and tumor size (sum of diameters) at week 8 relative to baseline (RS8) are widely investigated prognostic factors. However, joint analysis of data on demographic/clinical characteristics, blood biomarker levels, and chemotherapy exposure-driven early tumor response for improved prediction of overall survival (OS) is clinically not established. We developed a Weibull time-to-event model to predict OS, leveraging data from 365 patients receiving paclitaxel/platinum combination chemotherapy once every three weeks for & LE;six cycles. A developed tumor growth inhibition model, combining linear tumor growth and first-order paclitaxel area under the concentration-time curve-induced tumor decay, was used to derive individual RS8. The median model-derived RS8 in all patients was a 20.0% tumor size reduction (range from -78% to +15%). Whereas baseline carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin fragments, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were not significantly associated with OS in a subset of 221 patients, and lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-6 and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio levels were significant only in univariate analyses (p value < 0.05); C-reactive protein (CRP) in combination with RS8 most significantly affected OS (p value < 0.01). Compared to the median population OS of 11.3 months, OS was 128% longer at the 5th percentile levels of both covariates and 60% shorter at their 95th percentiles levels. The combined paclitaxel exposure-driven RS8 and baseline blood CRP concentrations enables early individual prognostic predictions for different paclitaxel dosing regimens, forming the basis for treatment decision and optimizing paclitaxel/platinum-based advanced NSCLC chemotherapy.

In recent years, the biological activity of terpyridine and its metal complexes has aroused considerable regard. On this basis, we synthesised new terpyridine derivatives of trehalose and glucose to improve the water solubility of terpyridine ligands and target them in cancer cells through glucose transporters. Glucose derivative and its copper(II) and iron(II) complexes showed antiproliferative activity. Interestingly, trehalose residue reduced the cytotoxicity of terpyridine. Moreover, we tested the ability of parent terpyridine ligands and their copper complexes to inhibit proteasome activity as an antineoplastic mechanism.

Novel approach for the performance augmentation of phase change material integrated battery thermal management system for number of charging/discharging cycles	ENERGY STORAGE			English	Article						battery thermal management system; electric vehicle; fins; lithium-ion battery; phase change material	LI-ION CELLS; MODULE; OPTIMIZATION; STORAGE	With the development of fast charging unit for electric vehicles (EVs) battery, it is required to develop a battery pack that can maintain the temperature in the desired range. Hence, some thermal management system is required to enhance performance and safety issues. The objective of the present work is to enhance the performance of phase change material (PCM)-based battery thermal management system (BTMS) for continuous charging/discharging cycles. The cycle is considered as 3C-1C as charging-discharging rates. The PCM-in-pack BTMS is effective only for one cycle, and after that, the value of maxi-mum battery temperature (T-max) and maximum battery temperature difference (delta T-max) reaches above 60 degrees C and 5 degrees C, respectively. The PCM-around-cell BTMS (PCM layer around battery cells) is found effective in maintaining delta T-max below 5 degrees C for three consecutive cycles but found effective in maintain-ing Tmax below 60 degrees C for the first cycle only. For further improvement, fins are utilized, and found that fin and PCM-around-cell BTMS can effectively main-tain Tmax below 60 degrees C for two cycles. Even the addition of fins is found effective after the second cycle; therefore, rest time between charging and discharging is explored for further improvement. With a 10-min rest time, both T-max and delta T-max are found under 60 degrees C and 5 degrees C for four consecutive cycles. However, the value of T-max increases around 4 degrees C to 5 degrees C after each cycle. This problem of increment in T-max after each cycle is eliminated by 20-min rest time and found almost similar T-max for four consecutive cycles. For 20 min of rest time between charging and discharging, Tmax is found with PCM-around-cell with fin based BTMS as 44.98 degrees C, 45.98 degrees C, 46.49 degrees C, and 46.82 degrees C during four consec-utive cycles. Hence, PCM-around-cell arrangement, fins, and rest time of 20 min can provide desirable results for a large number of consecutive cycles.	[Patel, Jay R. R.; Rathod, Manish K.

J	Sandhu, R; Lee, TE				Sandhu, Rebekah; Lee, Tao-en (Henry)			Incorporating handgrip strength examination into dietetic practice: A quality improvement project	NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						handgrip strength; malnutrition; nutrition assessment; quality improvement; rehabilitation	SUBJECTIVE GLOBAL ASSESSMENT; CONSENSUS; NUTRITION; FRAILTY; MALNUTRITION; DEFINITION; DIAGNOSIS; WEIGHT; GRIP	Protein-energy malnutrition is both prevalent and costly within the inpatient rehabilitation population. Registered dietitians play a key role in identifying, diagnosing, and treating protein-energy malnutrition. Handgrip strength has been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes, including malnutrition. Reduced handgrip strength is included as a criterion in national and international consensus guidelines of malnutrition diagnoses for functional changes. However, limited research and quality improvement projects have reported on its actual use in the clinical setting. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to (1) implement handgrip strength testing into dietitian care on three inpatient rehabilitation units to allow dietitians to identify and treat nutrition-related muscle function losses and (2) evaluate the feasibility, clinical utility, and clinical impact of this project. This quality improvement educational intervention demonstrated that handgrip strength is feasible, does not impact dietitian efficiency, and is clinically useful. Dietitians reported three areas in which handgrip strength provided value: assessing nutrition status, motivating patients, and monitoring responses to nutrition interventions. Specifically, they were able to shift away from focusing solely on change in weight to focusing on functional ability and strength. Although outcome measures demonstrated favorable outcomes, the results must be interpreted cautiously because of the small sample and pre-post uncontrolled design. Further high-quality research is required to provide more in-depth information on the utility and limitations of handgrip strength as an assessment, motivational, and monitoring tool for clinical dietetics.

However, with the results of extant studies on EO-performance relationship are not fully consistent, the potential mechanism about how EO influences firm performance needs to be further explored. Accordingly, this research investigates the mediating mechanism of EO-performance by considering the role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) from the resource dependence perspective. In addition, we assess the relationship between EO and CSR by examining the moderating roles of institutional support and dysfunctional competition. Using the sample data of 214 Chinese firms to test the hypotheses, we find that CSR mediates the relationship between EO and firm performance. Moreover, institutional support negatively moderates the EO-CSR relationship and dysfunctional competition positively moderates the relationship between EO and CSR. Based on the above results, our study provides practical implications for entrepreneurial firms striving to translate their EO into superior firm performance.

We examine the buffering role of victimised group identification on the association between the cognitive availability of historical trauma, historical trauma symptoms, and conspiracy beliefs. Two studies conducted in Poland (Study 1: Ukrainian minority, N = 92; Study 2: ethnic Poles; N = 227) revealed that among highly identified group members (compared to those with low levels of group identification), the relation between the cognitive availability of historical trauma and historical trauma symptoms was weaker. Study 2 additionally showed that the consequences of historical trauma are detectable among members of historically victimised groups, regardless of their own family history of victimisation, and that the cognitive availability of historical trauma correlates positively with conspiracy beliefs.

J	Tani, A; Adali, N				Tani, Amina; Adali, Nawal			"The understanding and attitude toward epilepsy in the Souss-Massa region of Morocco"	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						attitude; epilepsy; knowledge; myths	HEALTH-CARE; KNOWLEDGE; STIGMA; AWARENESS; STUDENTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PEOPLE	ObjectiveSociocultural beliefs about epilepsy impede medical treatment and social acceptance of people with epilepsy. These barriers can lead to disability and contribute to the stigmatization of people with epilepsy.Assessing knowledge, myths, and attitude about epilepsy and associated factors among adults in Souss-Massa, Morocco. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in which data were collected from a sample of 385 individuals in the Souss-Massa region of Southern Morocco. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. The analysis of the collected questionnaires was processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Results385 responses were included in the analysis. The results reveal a lack of knowledge, an unfavorable attitude, and the persistence of myths and misunderstandings about epilepsy. The findings of this study suggest that good knowledge was significantly associated with sociodemographic factors: the age range of more than 54 years and health professional status. In addition, the favorable attitude toward epilepsy correlates with the sociodemographic factors: male gender and urban residential area. SignificanceThe main finding of this study indicates insufficient knowledge, the persistence of myth, and an unfavorable attitude about epilepsy. Therefore, the application of public awareness programs about epilepsy in urban and rural areas is necessary.

The study aimed to test the presence and diversity of Phytophthora species in declining alder stands. The samples were collected from six stands situated by rivers/streams in the central and eastern parts of Slovakia. Phytophthora plurivora and P. cactorum were detected in soil, root and water samples. The most isolated species was P. plurivora. Both Phytophthora species have been recognized in the literature as the perpetrators of black alder dieback together with other species, such as P. alni or P. polonica. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. plurivora and P. cactorum in riverside stands with the main share of black alder in Slovakia.

In this study, red hybrid tilapias (Oreochromis spp.) were experimentally infected by intracoelomic injection with Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) to gain a better understanding of the clinicopathological changes during infection. Pale bodies and gill were observed in infected fish after 7 days of post-challenge (dpc) associated with severe anaemia. Further haematological analysis in TiLV-infected fish revealed decreased levels of haemoglobin and haematocrit at 3 dpc. Common pathological findings included pale and friable liver, pale intestine with catarrhal content, and dark and shrunken spleen in TiLV-infected fish at 7 dpc and 14 dpc. Histologically, reduced numbers of red blood cells and accumulation of melano-macrophage centre in the spleen were found in infected fish at 3 dpc, and severe lesions were more commonly observed at 7 and 14 dpc. Lymphocyte infiltration, syncytial cell formation and multifocal necrotic hepatitis were the prominent pathological findings in the liver of infected fish. The severity of pathological changes was associated with TiLV-infection with higher viral loads and with the expression pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral genes, including interferon regulatory factor 1 (irf1), interleukin (il-8), radical s-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (rsad2) and mx. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the haematological profile and pathological changes in tilapia during TiLV infection. Overall, lesions present in various organs, together with alteration of host immune response in TiLV-infected fish, indicate the systemic infection of this virus. The knowledge gained from this study improves our understanding of how TiLV causes pathological and haematological changes in tilapia.

How talent is understood and defined has significant implications for its management within organizations, yet these aspects are often overlooked in the extant literature. Through a review of 192 articles in the sub-disciplines of talent management (sub-stream of strategic human resource management), stars (human capital), and high potential (organizational behavior/-psychology), we offer guidance for research on talent. Our findings suggest that the current research adopts an overly binary conceptualization of talent, as illustrated in five relevant dimensions: inclusive-exclusive, innate-acquired, transferable-context dependent, subject-object, and input-outcomes. We call for a more nuanced approach to the topic and build insights from paradox theory, encouraging a transition from "either/or" perspectives to "both/and" perspectives. Matching theory is identified as a useful lens to guide future research, and we offer suggestions for a more nuanced approach in practice by encouraging organizations and their stakeholders to embrace the paradoxes of talent.

Recent evidence suggests that AD may also impair cognition, including attention and memory. In a pilot study of six children with AD, we administered a comprehensive battery of assessments to evaluate cognition and behavior and found that this approach was feasible and practical, which will enable the conduct of future larger-scale studies to characterize the impact of AD on cognitive function.

The formation of microcavity intersubband polaritons at frequencies as low as 1.8 THz is demonstrated, with a sustained ultra-strong coupling regime up to a temperature of 200 K. Thanks to the excellent intersubband transition linewidth, polaritons present quality factors up to 17. It is additionally shown that the ultra-strong coupling regime is preserved when the active region is embedded in sub-wavelength resonators, with an estimated relative strength eta = Omega(R)/omega(0) = 0.12. This represents an important milestone for future studies of quantum vacuum radiation because such resonators can be optically modulated at ultrafast rates, possibly leading to the generation of non-classical light via the dynamic Casimir effect. Finally, with an effective volume of 2x10(-6)lambda(3)(0), it is estimated that fewer than 3000 electrons per resonator are ultra-strongly coupled to the quantized electromagnetic mode, proving it is also a promising approach to explore few-electron polaritonic systems operating at relatively high temperatures.

Accordingly, to find the mechanism of CC progression at molecular level is imminent.Methods: The mRNA expression data were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and squalene epoxidase (SQLE) level in the tumor and adjuvant tissues of CC was analyzed. The pathway enrichment analysis of target mRNAs was performed based on the GSEA database. The cancerous tissues and para-cancerous tissues of CC patients were collected for immunohistochemistry. SQLE and p53 mRNA expression was ensured by qRT-polymerase chain reaction. SQLE and p53 protein levels were determined by western blot. Cell functional assays focused on evaluating the malignant behaviors of cancer cells in each treatment group. Nude mouse xenograft models were constructed for tumorigenicity analysis.Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that SQLE expression was high in CC tissues, which was linked to the poor prognosis. SQLE could affect the p53 signaling pathway. Cell functional assays demonstrated that SQLE expression was promoted in CC cell lines, and overexpressing SQLE facilitated the malignant phenotypes of CC cells, whereas silencing SQLE suppressed CC progression in vitro and in vivo. Besides, the repressed p53 signaling pathway could reverse the effect caused by silenced SQLE.Conclusion: SQLE could promote CC progression by modulating the p53 signaling pathway.

We define the geometric mean of probability measures by the aid of which we investigate information geometry of P(M)$\mathcal {P}(M)$, equipped with G. We show that a geodesic segment joining arbitrary probability measures mu(1) and mu(2) is expressed by using the normalized geometric mean of its endpoints. As an application, we show that any two points of P(M)$\mathcal {P}(M)$ can be joined by a unique geodesic.

J	Jelnikar, A				Jelnikar, Ana			"A Holy Experiment ": Medical Mission Sisters or how Women Religious within the Catholic Church Became Doctors	JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY			English	Article								Drawing on archival sources and adopting a microhistory approach that pays attention to "hidden transcripts, " this article aims to fill a gap in the scholarship on Catholic women and medical missions by analysing the largely overlooked contribution of two women doctors, Agnes McLaren and Anna Dengel, in professionalising the healing ministry of the Catholic Church. In 1925, Dengel founded an international religious congregation, the Society of Catholic Medical Missionaries, with the goal of providing professional health care to women in British India at a time when Church law still forbade Sisters to practise the full scope of medicine. Focusing on the years leading up to the Society's foundation and its early days in India, I highlight the multilayered context of their "holy experiment, " the various hierarchies and discourses within which they operated, and the ways in which as European Catholic women religious they negotiated with the Church patriarchy. Focusing on and advancing a nuanced approach to female religious agency, I demonstrate how their complex marginal positionality vis-a-vis both Church hierarchy and British colonial establishment made them paradoxical players whose very terms of subordination gave them possibilities for agency and self-determination. My analysis of their motivations, ideas, and self-understanding challenges the standard postcolonial critique of medical missions.

Prevalence of genotoxic bacteria in men undergoing biopsy for prostate cancer	PROSTATE			English	Article						E; coli; genotoxin; prostate cancer; urinary microbiome	CYTOLETHAL DISTENDING TOXINS; DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; STRAINS	BackgroundNew evidence suggests that bacteria-produced DNA toxins may have a role in the development or progression of prostate cancer. To determine the prevalence of these genes in a noninfection (i.e., colonized) state, we screened urine specimens in men before undergoing a biopsy for prostate cancer detection. MethodsWe developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction using three of the most described bacterial genotoxin gene primers: Colibactin (polyketone synthase [pks] gene island: clbN and clbB), cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf1) toxin, and cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) represented gene islands. After calibration on Escherichia coli samples of known genotypes, we used a training and validation cohort. We performed multiplex testing on a training cohort of previously collected urine from 45 men undergoing prostate biopsy. For the validation cohort, we utilized baseline urine samples from a previous randomized clinical trial (n = 263) with known prostate cancer outcomes. ResultsThe prevalence of four common bacterial genotoxin genes detected in the urine before prostate biopsy for prostate cancer is 8% (25/311). The prevalence of pks island (clbN and clbB), cnf1, and cdt toxin genes are 6.1%, 2.4%, and 1.7%, respectively. We found no association between urinary genotoxins and prostate cancer (p = 0.83). We did identify a higher proportion of low-grade cancer (92% vs. 44%) in those men positive for urinary genotoxin and higher-grade cancer in those genotoxin negative (8% vs. 56%, p = 0.001). ConclusionsThe prevalence of urinary genotoxins is low and does not correspond to a prostate cancer diagnosis. The urine was taken at one point in time and does not rule out the possibility of previous exposure.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) play an important role in bone regeneration. Emerging evidence suggests that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) plays a significant role in bone development and metabolism. Therefore, this study investigates changes to METTL3 in the osteogenic differentiation of adipose stem cells in osteoporotic rats (OP-ASCs) and explores ways to enhance their osteogenic ability. MethodsAn animal model of osteoporosis was established by removing both ovaries in rats. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to detect the expression of METTL3 and bone-related molecules, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteopontin (Opn). Furthermore, alkaline phosphatase staining was used to confirm the osteogenic potential of stem cells. Mettl3 small interfering RNA and Mettl3 overexpression lentivirus were used to assess the role of METTL3 in osteogenic differentiation of ASCs and OP-ASCs. ResultsThe osteogenic differentiation capacity and Mettl3 expression significantly decreased in OP-ASCs. Moreover, Mettl3 silencing down-regulated the osteogenic ability of ASCs, and overexpression of Mettl3 recovered the impaired osteogenic capacity in OP-ASCs in vitro. ConclusionThe Mettl3 expression levels and osteogenic potential of OP-ASCs decreased. However, overexpression of METTL3 rescued the osteogenic ability of OP-ASCs, providing a new target for treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.

Patients with PP tend to experience frequent flares and significant morbidity. This study aims to determine the clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and treatment of PP patients in Malaysia. This was a cross-sectional study of patients with PP notified to the Malaysian Psoriasis Registry (MPR) between January 2007 and December 2018. Of 21 735 psoriasis patients, 148 (0.7%) had pustular psoriasis. Of these, 93 (62.8%) were diagnosed with generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) and 55 (37.2%) with localized PP (LPP). The mean age for pustular psoriasis onset was 31.71 & PLUSMN; 18.33 years with a male to female ratio of 1:2.1. Patients with PP were more likely to have dyslipidaemia (23.6% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.022), severe disease (Body surface area > 10 and/or Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] > 10) (64.8% vs. 50%, p = 0.003) and require systemic therapy (51.4% vs. 13.9%, p < 0.001) compared to non-PP patients. Patients with PP also suffered greater impairment to their quality of life (DLQI > 10, 48.9% vs. 40.3%, p = 0.046), had more days off school/work (2.06 & PLUSMN; 6.09 vs. 0.5 & PLUSMN; 4.91, p = 0.004) and a higher mean number of hospitalizations (0.31 & PLUSMN; 0.95 vs. 0.05 & PLUSMN; 1.22, p = 0.001) in 6 months compared to non-PP patients. Overall, 0.7% of psoriasis patients in the MPR had pustular psoriasis. Patients with PP had a higher rate of dyslipidaemia, severe disease, greater impairment of quality of life and systemic therapy usage compared to other psoriasis subtypes.

Herein, as a promising proton-selective carrier, sulfonated piperazine covalent triazine framework (s-pCTF) with the channel size of approximate to 1.5 nm and abundant fast proton hopping sites is introduced into sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) to fabricate advanced ICM for vanadium flow battery (VFB) application. The interior protoplasmic channels of s-pCTF demonstrate significant Donnan exclusion effect, resulting in a high proton/vanadium ion selectivity in theory (6.22 x 10(5)). Meanwhile, the nitrogen-rich sub-2-nm channels yield fast proton highway, and exterior-grafted sulfonic acid groups further facilitate the proton transfer. By regulating the ion sieving and proton conductivity, the optimal hybrid membrane exhibits synchronously improved battery performance with an enhanced energy efficiency (92.41% to 78.53% at 40-200 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability for 900 cycles over 400 h (EE: 87.2-85% at 120 mA cm(-2)), outperforming pure SPEEK and Nafion212 membranes. This study validates the applicability of organic porous CTF with sub-2-nm channels and desired functionality in ICMs for high-performance VFB application.

As revealed by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, while codeposition of Cr atoms and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaminotriphenylene precursors produces irregular branches, crystalline Cr-3(HITP)(2) frameworks are obtained by depositing Cr atoms to the Ni-3(HITP)(2) templates. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the binding energy between Cr and HITP ligands is much higher than that for Ni, which hampers the growth of crystalline Cr-3(HITP)(2) frameworks through direct coordination assembly but makes the substitution reaction energetically favorable. This work demonstrates a new strategy to prepare high-quality early-transition-metal-based c-MOFs under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.

We do so by integrating constructs of gender and gender inequality with those of institutional logics and institutional voids. We find that a refined understanding of institutional voids is required to pave the way for a meaningful theoretical integration and empirical application of the related conceptualizations. We offer such a revised definition by placing formal and informal logics (rather than institutions) at the heart of it. In our theorizing, we propose that gender interplaying with formal and informal institutional logics create varying degrees of obscure and unique institutional voids that shape WIE prevalence. The proposed harmonized theoretical lens provides researchers with flexible yet consistent guidance for conducting context-specific empirical work that can coherently advance understanding of underlying logics shaping WIE and related agency.

Associations of potential ADRD plasma biomarkers in cognitively normal volunteers	ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA			English	Article; Early Access						aging; Alzheimer's disease; batch; blood-based biomarkers; dementia; demographics; medical conditions; normal cognition; plasma biomarkers; SiMOA	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEMENTIA	IntroductionThis study examined the relationships between 13 novel blood-plasma biomarkers and dementia-related demographic and health factors in a cohort of 237 cognitively normal research volunteers whose average age was approximate to 82 years and who were 63% female. MethodsWe regressed each biomarker on selected covariates to explore the associations between the biomarkers and selected factors to assess whether they may contribute to biomarker values. Post hoc sensitivity analyses were done with updated data and consistent variable sets for robustness and batch effects. ResultsBiomarker concentrations were largely not associated with demographics or health conditions, but some expected associations (e.g., apolipoprotein E [APOE] status with amyloid beta [A beta]42/A beta 40) were observed. Post hoc results remained similar to those of the main analysis. DiscussionThe absence of strong associations between the biomarkers with age, gender, or medical conditions suggests that changes in these biomarkers, when observed, may be attributable to neuropathological changes. HighlightsAmong N = 237 cognitively normal adults, we studied candidate Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) plasma biomarkers.Biomarkers were largely not associated with demographic or health factors.Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status was associated with amyloid beta (A beta)42/A beta 40 ratio.These results support hypotheses that plasma biomarkers are informative for ADRD.

The proportion of those living with obesity is also increasing in nursing homes. This could impact the nursing care required, equipment and facilities provided, and morbidity in these settings. Limited evidence exists on clinical consequences of obesity in nursing home residents and their care. ObjectiveTherefore, the aim was to examine the rate and associated factors of obesity (BMI >= 30; class I (BMI 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2)), class II (BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m(2)), and class III (BMI >40.0 kg/m(2))) amongst older nursing home residents in European countries. MethodsWe analysed data from 21,836 people who reside in nursing homes in Austria, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. They participated in the "International Prevalence Measurement of Care Quality", a cross sectional study between 2016 and 2019, where trained nurses interviewed the residents, reviewed care records, and conducted clinical examinations. A tested and standardised questionnaire comprised questions on demographic data, measured BMI, medical diagnosis according to ICD-10, and care dependency. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed. ResultsObesity rates were highest in Austria (17.1%) and lowest in the UK (13.0%) (p = .006). Residents with obesity were younger and less likely to be care dependent or living with dementia and had more often diabetes mellitus, endocrine, metabolic, and skin diseases compared to residents without obesity (p < .05). Most obese residents had obesity class I. Therefore, two subgroups were built (class I vs. class II + III). Residents with obesity class II + III were more frequently care dependent for mobility, getting dressed and undressed, and personal hygiene compared to residents with class I (p < .05). ConclusionsThis study identified several factors that are associated with obesity amongst older nursing home residents in selected European countries. Implications for practiceThe division into obesity classes is important for planning targeted care according to the individual needs of nursing home residents.

Traditional manual welding of intersecting curves with low efficiency and poor consistency has been gradually replaced by robotic welding. However, this process cannot eliminate the defects during the welding forming process, resulting in welding deviations. It is difficult to meet the requirements in all-position welding of intersecting curves. To achieve accurate layering and routing for robotic welding, it is necessary to study the weld forming control and prediction method in the jacket. Response surface methodology adhering to central composite design is used to establish a mathematical model to correlate the effects of input process parameters (voltage, current, speed, weaving amplitude) on response variables, i.e., aspect ratio, cross-sectional area, and side wetting angle. The confirmation experiments and analysis of variance results validate that the percentage error between the predicted and actual values is less than 5%, which demonstrates the developed models are reliable. Prediction of filling weld forming changes of intersecting joints in jackets can be achieved.

An investigation on<i> Moringa</i><i> oleifera</i> fruit (drumstick)- derived cellulose micro and nanofiber reinforced styrene butadiene rubber composites	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article						cellulose nanofiber; composite; drumstick; green-filler; microfiber; rubber	NATURAL-RUBBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FIBER; FILLER; NANOCRYSTALS	The current focus in the elastomer industry is to look for biobased or natural filler for various compounds. The reinforcing effect of waste drumstick-derived cellulose micro and nanofiber in styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) was investigated for the very first time. Cellulose microfibers and nanofibers were isolated from the drumstick fruit peel and characterized using different techniques such as x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The filler-polymer interaction in the composites was studied using the bound rubber measurements, which showed that the bound rubber content of the composite increased from 0.5% to 8.1% at 5 phr cellulose nanofiber loading. The tensile strength and modulus of the modified cellulose microfiber-containing composite were higher than both the unfilled SBR and the raw fiber-SBR composites. The addition of 5 phr nanofiber to SBR showed a 46% increment of the tensile strength than the control compound. The die swell index of the cellulose fiber reinforced composites came down attesting the better processability of the extrudates. The addition of cellulose fiber also improved the wet skid resistance of the composites as seen from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. Hence, this work confirms the application of modified drumstick microfibers and nanofibers as sustainable fillers for high-performance elastomers composites.

ObjectivesThe primary objective of this systematic review is to critically examine safety and feasibility of the different robotic approaches. MethodsThe literature on robotic thyroidectomy was systematically reviewed. Primary endpoints were surgery duration, length of hospital stay, complications, postoperative pain and cosmetic satisfaction. ResultsSixty-eight studies with a total of 14433 patients were included. Depending on the robotic approach used, operative duration ranged between 89 and 230 min and hospitalisation stay between 0.1 and 5.6 days. Complication rates varied between 7.3% and 29%. Postoperative pain visual analogue scores (VAS) ranged from 0.6 to 4.71. ConclusionRobotic thyroidectomy results in high cosmetic satisfaction and quality of life. No differences in complication rates between robotic and traditional approaches are observed, supporting safety and feasibility of these robotic techniques.

Novel gene vectors that can achieve targeted delivery of siRNA to the tumor cells without causing any side effects are urgently needed. To this end, the large amino acid mimicking carbon dots with guanidinium functionalization (LAAM GUA-CDs) are designed and synthesized by choosing arginine and dopamine hydrochloride as precursors. LAAM GUA-CDs can load siRNA through the multiple hydrogen bonds between their guanidinium groups and phosphate groups in siRNA. Meanwhile, the amino acid groups at the edges of LAAM GUA-CDs endow them the capacity to target tumors. After loading siBcl-2 as a therapeutic agent, LAAM GUA-CDs/siBcl-2 has a high tumor inhibition rate of up to 68%, which is twice more than that of commercial Lipofectamine 2000. Furthermore, LAAM GUA-CDs do not cause side effect during antitumor treatment owing to their high tumor-targeting ability, thus providing a versatile strategy for tumor-targeted siRNA delivery and cancer therapy.

The paper draws on data collected in vocational schools, with adolescents aged 14-16, in Italy. It draws on transcribed interactions to analyse activities in school classrooms in which facilitators support migrant adolescent's agency in producing narratives of their personal cultural trajectories. The paper shows how facilitators and adolescents share the rights of telling the narratives, the gender differences that become visible in the adolescents' narratives, and the ways in which facilitation supports the hybrid integration of migrant adolescents.

Broad host-range pathogens as bioherbicides: managing nontarget plant disease risk	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						bioherbicides; plant disease; safety zones; risk analysis; withholding period	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENT; SCLEROTINIA-SCLEROTIORUM; PHOMA-MACROSTOMA; CANDIDATE BIOHERBICIDE; CALIFORNIAN THISTLE; FUSARIUM-TUMIDUM; SAFETY ZONES; BIOCONTROL; WEED; MYCOHERBICIDE	Plant pathogens with a broad host range are commercially more attractive as microbial bioherbicides than strictly host-specific pathogens as a result of the wider market potential of a product capable of controlling multiple species. However, the perceived spatiotemporal disease risk to nontarget plants is a barrier to their adoption for weed control. We consider two approaches to managing this risk. First, we consider safety zones and withholding periods for bioherbicide treatment sites. These must ensure inoculum spreading from, or surviving at the site, exposes nontarget plants to no more inoculum than from natural sources. They can be determined using simple dispersal models. We show that a ratio of added:natural inoculum of 1.0 is biologically reasonable as an 'acceptable risk' and a sound basis for safety zones and withholding periods. These would be analogous to the 'conditions of use' for synthetic chemical herbicides aimed at minimizing collateral damage to susceptible plants from spray drift and persistent soil residues. Second, weed-specific isolates of broad host-range pathogens may avoid the need for safety zones and withholding periods. Such isolates have been found in many broad host-range pathogen species. Their utilization as bioherbicides may more easily meet the requirements of regulators. Mixtures of different weed-specific isolates of a pathogen could provide bioherbicides with commercially attractive spectrums of weed control activity. (c) 2023 The Authors.

A new experimental procedure using in situ oxido-reduction indicators was applied to irradiated fuel, and we aim to use it with chromium-doped unirradiated UO2. Nevertheless, we had first to characterise the chemical state of the chromium precipitates in our sample before. Here, we present the method we used for statistical characterisation of these precipitates using several methods, amongst which Raman spectroscopy plays a major role. Moreover, the Raman spectra of the precipitates were interpreted as evidence of a uranium stabilised Cr3O4 phase.

MethodsPubMed, Web of Science, CBM, Embase, Cochrane, Wanfang, VIPP, and CNKI were searched to identify published eligible randomized controlled trials. The primary results were the postoperative 24 h morphine consumption and pain scores, while the secondary outcomes included pain scores at other times, press times of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), times to request for first rescue analgesia, the incidence of request for rescue analgesia, opioid-related complications, nerve blocks related complications and patient satisfaction. ResultsWe included 20 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, which involved 1293 participants. The morphine consumption and the pain scores during 24 h postoperatively were significantly decreased in the ESPB group versus the control group (p < 0.00001). Furthermore, ESPB also reduced pain scores at other time points, press times of PCIA, and times to first rescue analgesia requirement. Meanwhile, there was a lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and skin pruritus in the ESPB group than in the control group. ConclusionsCompared to general anesthesia alone, ESPB combined with general anesthesia can effectively reduce the postoperative pain intensity within 48 h and opioid consumption within 24 h after breast cancer surgery, and reduce the incidence of opioid and nerve blocks related complications.

However, the synthesis of size-controlled, ligand-free, and air-stable Ag clusters with high yields has not been well-established. Herein, it is shown that isostructural porous ionic crystals (PICs) with redox-active polyoxometalates (POMs) can be used to synthesize Ag clusters via electron transfer from POMs to Ag+. Ag clusters with average numbers of three, four, or six atoms emitting blue, green, or red colors, respectively, are formed and stabilized in the PICs under ambient conditions without any protecting ligands. The cluster size solely correlates with the degree of electron transfer, which is controlled by the reduction time and types of ions or elements of the PICs. Thus, advantages have been taken of POMs as electron sources and PICs as scaffolds to demonstrate a convenient method to obtain few-atom Ag clusters.

This article highlights interventions that increase awareness of and promotes physical and mental health for African American populations. DesignDiscursive Paper. MethodSearching literature published between 2012 and 2022 in PubMed, SCOPUS, EBSCO Host and Google Scholar, we explored factors associated with systemic racism and generational anxiety. DiscussionEvidence-based literature supports the application of the Bowenian family therapy theoretical framework to understand the intergenerational impact of systemic racism and to address the transmission of anxiety symptoms in African American populations. ConclusionCulturally appropriate interventions are needed to decrease anxiety symptoms in an attempt to heal intergenerational trauma and to improve family dynamics in African American populations. Impact to Nursing PracticeNurses play an integral role in providing holistic quality patient-centred care for African American populations who have experienced racial trauma. It is critical for nurses to implement culturally responsive and racially informed care with patients that focuses on self-awareness, health promotion, prevention and healing in efforts to address racial trauma. Application of Bowenian family therapy can aid in the reduction of both intergenerational transmission of racial trauma and generational anxiety.

Herbivorous cladoceran essential fatty acid and cholesterol content across a phosphorous and DOC gradients of boreal lakes-Importance of diet selection	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						browning; eutrophication; nutritional quality; seston composition; zooplankton diet	FRESH-WATER ZOOPLANKTON; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; PRIMARY PRODUCERS; FOOD SELECTION; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; PHYTOPLANKTON; CARBON; SESTON; GROWTH; EUTROPHICATION	Eutrophication has been shown to increase production of nutritionally low-quality cyanobacteria and decrease the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of seston. Contrarily, lake browning inhibits cyanobacteria contribution in seston and favours poorly grazable mixotrophic algal species. These environmental changes have probable impacts on the diet and long-chain PUFA content of primary consumers. However, herbivorous zooplankton may preferentially retain PUFAs through diet selection for optimal growth and reproduction, but such selective feeding is challenging to document in nature owing to the difficulties in quantifying zooplankton diet. Here, we sampled seston and herbivorous cladocerans (Daphnia sp. and Bosmina sp.) from lakes (n = 23) in Finland along eutrophication (total phosphorous) and browning gradients (dissolved organic carbon [DOC]). We analysed the fatty acid content of seston (mg FA/g POC [particular organic content]) and cladocerans (mg FA/g C), and estimated available and consumed diet biomass percentages with quantitative fatty acid signature analysis. Cladoceran diet preference was evaluated as the difference between consumed and available food sources, to understand if they preferentially retain high nutritional quality diet. Generally, lake chemistry and morphometry poorly explained seston and cladoceran long-chain PUFA contents. However, multiple linear models for shorter chain PUFAs (linoleic acid [LA] and alpha-linolenic acid [ALA]) performed better in explaining variation in the LA and ALA content of seston (20% and 11%) and cladocerans (36% and 46%, respectively). The factors most strongly and positively associated with the LA and ALA content of seston and cladocerans were phosphorus and DOC concentrations, respectively. Seston and cladoceran PUFA contents were clearly uncorrelated. In most of the sampled lakes, high-quality diet (i.e., diatoms and cryptomonads) was preferred by cladocerans and low-quality diet (cyanobacteria) was avoided. Lake chemistry poorly explained cladoceran diet preference, but high-quality preference was positively associated with lake average depth. In summary, our space-for-time study approach did not reveal that eutrophication or browning downgraded the seston nor cladoceran PUFA quality. We found no correlation with seston and cladoceran PUFA content, but a clear mismatch between available and consumed diet. Our results suggest a selective feeding strategy of cladocerans, possibly through foraging in high-quality algae patches or selective assimilation of PUFAs.

The role of the bladder diary in phenotyping men with LUTS	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						diagnosis; disease management; lower urinary tract symptoms; oliguria; polyuria; urodynamics	URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS	AimsThe aim of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) grouped by 24-h urine output determined from a bladder voiding diary. MethodsAn online database was queried to identify men who completed a 24-hour bladder diary (24HBD), and the Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (LUTSS) questionnaire from 2015 to 2019 using a mobile app. Data from the bladder diary and questionnaire were contemporaneously matched within a 2-week period. Additional data, including maximum uroflow (Q(max)) and postvoid residual urine (PVR), were obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR). The cohort was divided into three groups: normal, oliguria, and polyuria based on their 24-hour voided volume (24HVV). The LUTSS, 24HVV, maximum voided volume (MVV), maximum flow rate (Q(max)), and PVR were compared between those with oliguria and polyuria. ResultsA total of 327 men (mean age 62, SD: 19) completed the LUTSS questionnaire and contemporaneous 24HBD. Of these, 61% had a normal 24HVV, 13% had oliguria, and 26% had polyuria. A total of 147 patients from the study cohort had contemporaneous Q(max) and PVR abstracted from the EMR. There was no difference in symptom severity, bother, or PVR among the three patient groups. However, several objective metrics were significantly correlated with urine output. Men with oliguria, as compared to men with polyuria were older (65 vs. 55 years) and had lower MVV (260 vs. 470 mL), fewer voids/24 h (8 vs. 13), and lower Q(max) (8.5 vs. 18.3 mL/s). ConclusionsThese observations suggest that men with oliguria or polyuria and LUTS constitute easily distinguished phenotypes that might require different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms. Those with oliguria were older, and had lower MVVs and much lower uroflows, suggesting that they are more likely to have underlying disorders such as bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor underactivity or may be patients with overactive bladder who reduced fluid intake to improve symptoms.

They mainly interact with cell membranes through surface electrostatic potentials and the formation of secondary structures, resulting in permeability and destruction of target microorganism membranes. Our earlier work showed that two leading AMPs, MSI-78 (4-20) and pardaxin (1-22), had potent antimicrobial activity against a range of bacteria. It is known that the attachment of moderate-length lipid carbon chains to cationic peptides can further improve the functionality of these peptides through enhanced interactions with the membrane lipid bilayer, inducing membrane curvature, destabilization, and potential leakage. Thus, in this work, we aimed to investigate the antimicrobial activity, oligomerization propensity, and lipid-membrane binding interactions of a range of N-terminal lipidated analogs of MSI-78 (4-20) and pardaxin (1-22). Molecular modeling results suggest that aggregation of the N-lipidated AMPs may impart greater structural stability to the peptides in solution and a greater depth of lipid bilayer insertion for the N-lipidated AMPs over the parental peptide. Our experimental and computational findings provide insights into how N-terminal lipidation of AMPs may alter their conformations, with subsequent effects on their functional properties in regard to their self-aggregation behavior, membrane interactions, and antimicrobial activity.

J	Liu, Q; Ma, B; Song, MY; Sun, W; Zhang, H				Liu, Qi; Ma, Bing; Song, Mingyuan; Sun, Wei; Zhang, Hao			Age-dependent changes in the prognostic advantage of papillary thyroid cancer in women: A SEER-based study	CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						papillary thyroid cancer; papillary thyroid microcarcinoma; SEER; sex-difference; survival	ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; TRENDS; GENDER; SEX; EXPRESSION; MENOPAUSE; MORTALITY; RISK	BackgroundPapillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is more prevalent in women, and women show a better prognosis than men; however, the factors contributing to this prognostic difference are confounding. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of the interaction between sex and age on the prognosis of PTC. MethodsA total of 108,459 patients with PTC were retrospectively analysed, and Cox-regression models were used to assess differences in disease specific survival (DSS) by sex, with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to control for between-group differences in prognosis by sex due to age change. Restricted cubic splines were used to analyse prognostic differences between sexes for papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) and PTC. Multiple mediation analyses were used to assess the direct or indirect effect of sex on DSS. ResultsThe DSS was higher for women than men (98.6% vs. 95.4%, chi(2) = 458.57, p < .001). After IPTW adjustment, the DSS of women was better than that of men (HR = 0.67, 0.60-0.76). In the subgroup analysis, women had an advantage in DSS across most age intervals (crude HR = 0.166 [0.082-0.337], p < .001, IPTW-adjusted HR = 0.331 [0.161-0.681], p < .001). The difference between the two gradually narrowed with increasing age, and the prognosis of women was better than that of men in PTMC, while this advantage was not obvious in PTC. ConclusionsThe overall PTC prognosis of women is better than that of men, but the prognostic advantage of women diminishes with age and tumour growth. These differences in prognosis may be due to some indirect factors caused by different sexes.

In this paper, starch graft polymerization of acrylamide-allyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (St-g-ATMAC) is prepared by grafting and copolymerizing acrylamide and the short-chain quaternary ammonium cationic monomer ATMAC onto the molecular chain of soluble starch. Compared with PAM and CPAM, this flocculant has a lower water content in the filter cake after treating wastewater, making the subsequent treatment easier. Moreover, the flocculant is resistant to high temperature. Specifically, at 40 degrees C, the filter cake moisture content (FCMC) is still lower than those of PAM and CPAM. Furthermore, the flocculant is resistant to acid and alkali. In the over-acidic and over-alkaline environment after treatment, the FCMC remains lower than that of the PAM- and CPAM-treated mud cake. In summary, St-g-ATMAC is a new type of water treatment flocculant that can effectively treat wastewater with low dosage, wide temperature, and pH range and has the potential to be widely used in water treatment.

Unravelling G protein-coupled receptor signalling networks using global phosphoproteomics	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						G protein-coupled receptor; ligands; mass spectrometry; phosphoproteomics; signalling networks	DOWNSTREAM; PROTEOMICS	G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation initiates signalling via a complex network of intracellular effectors that combine to produce diverse cellular and tissue responses. Although we have an advanced understanding of the proximal events following receptor stimulation, the molecular detail of GPCR signalling further downstream often remains obscure. Unravelling these GPCR-mediated signalling networks has important implications for receptor biology and drug discovery. In this context, phosphoproteomics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating global GPCR signal transduction. Here, we provide a brief overview of the phosphoproteomic workflow and discuss current limitations and future directions for this technology. By highlighting some of the novel insights into GPCR signalling networks gained using phosphoproteomics, we demonstrate the utility of global phosphoproteomics to dissect GPCR signalling networks and to accelerate discovery of new targets for therapeutic development.

MethodsAn exploratory retrospective cohort study of 430 OSCC patients was conducted. We examined associations of follow-up attendance within the first year after surgery with selected demographic and clinical factors, and with early detection of disease progression. ResultsThe mean number of follow-up visits within the first year after surgery was 3.9 out of the 12 recommended at our center; few patients were fully adherent. Age >= 70 years, unmarried status, high education level, and negative history of surgery for premalignant or malignant lesions from oral cavity or other sites were significantly associated with lower follow-up attendance. Greater follow-up attendance was significantly associated with early detection of disease progression during the first year after surgery (p = 0.025). ConclusionsAdherence to follow-up visits was poor. Several sociodemographic and clinical factors were related to follow-up attendance, greater follow-up attendance was significantly associated with early detection of disease progression, and these should be further explored in future research.

Sub-nanometer-scale aggregation patterns of monoethanolamine-(CO2)(n), n=1-4, were identified. An interesting competition between the monoethanolamine intramolecular hydrogen bond and the intermolecular interactions between monoethanolamine and CO2 upon cluster growth was discovered, revealing an intriguing CO2 binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. These findings are in sharp contrast to the general results for aqueous solutions. In the quinary complex, a cap-like CO2 tetramer was observed cooperatively surrounding the monoethanolamine. As the cluster approaches the critical size of new particle formation, the contribution of CO2 self-assembly to the overall stability increases.

Materials and MethodsOne hundred and twenty patients were randomized into four groups. Implants were placed using both stereolithographic surgical guide and dynamic navigation in the SD group, stereolithographic surgical guide in S group, dynamic navigation in D group, and conventional freehand in FH group. Analysis of deviation between planned and final implant position, as well as K means analysis was conducted for implant deviation at platform, apex, and angle (primary outcomes) and directional distribution at platform and apex (secondary outcome). ResultsSignificant differences were found among the four groups (p < .001): The 3D deviation at the platform (mm) of SD, S, D, and FH groups was 0.62 +/- 0.50, 1.06 +/- 0.67, 1.02 +/- 0.45, and 1.48 +/- 0.68, respectively, at apex (mm) was 0.75 +/- 0.57, 1.40 +/- 0.71, 1.28 +/- 0.50, and 2.18 +/- 0.95, respectively, and angle (degrees) was 1.24 +/- 1.41, 3.18 +/- 2.04, 3.28 +/- 1.57, and 7.50 +/- 4.06, respectively. Deviation at the platform of FH group was significantly more toward mesial (p = .026) and coronal (p = .014) direction, while at the apex, toward distal (p = .004) and lingual (p = .002) than SD group.

Here, using 2D layered double perovskite (C6H5CH2CH2NH3+)(4)AgBiBr8 as a model system, we advance a fundamental physicochemical mechanism of the PIE from the perspective of carrier dynamics and excited-state behaviors of local lattice distortion. We observed a pressure-driven STE transformation from dark to bright states, corresponding a strong broadband Stokes-shifted emission. Further theoretical analysis demonstrated that the suppressed lattice distortion and enhanced electronic dimensionality in the excited-state play an important role in the formation of stabilized bright STEs, which could manipulate the self-trapping energy and lattice deformation energy to form an energy barrier between the potential energy curves of ground- and excited-state, and enhance the electron-hole orbital overlap, respectively.

The scalability of CO2 reduction and H-2 energy is one of the most enigmatic questions asked by the calamitous environmental changes happening across the world such as bushfires in Australia, Amazon and California or the melting of Arctic and Antarctic ice scalps. Thus, the research fraternity is keen to elevate the efficiency of CO2 reduction and H-2 energy to the extent that the good chemical livestock produced by CO2 conversion and H-2 fuel would become principal energy resources. In this quest, photocatalytic pathway envisions the environmentally benign protocol to bring about CO2 reduction and H-2 production. Photo-reduction of CO2 and H-2 generation via photocatalytic water splitting by utilizing oxide based heterostructured photocatalysts are the promising approaches to carry out CO2 mitigation and H-2 production efficiently ascribed to the advanced optoelectronic and structural superiority of oxides photocatalysts as discussed in this review.

J	Bader, C; Delapré, A; Houssaye, A				Bader, Camille; Delapre, Arnaud; Houssaye, Alexandra			Shape variation in the limb long bones of modern elephants reveals adaptations to body mass and habitat	JOURNAL OF ANATOMY			English	Article						3D geometric morphometrics; bone external anatomy; elephants; functional morphology	MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; LOXODONTA-AFRICANA; TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS; FORELIMB MORPHOLOGY; ASIAN ELEPHANTS; ALLOMETRY; SIZE; LOCOMOTION; EVOLUTION; OSTEOLOGY	During evolution, several vertebrate lineages have shown trends towards an increase in mass. Such a trend is associated with physiological and musculoskeletal changes necessary to carry and move an increasingly heavy body. Due to their prominent role in the support and movement of the body, limb long bones are highly affected by these shifts in body mass. Elephants are the heaviest living terrestrial mammals, displaying unique features allowing them to withstand their massive weight, such as the columnarity of their limbs, and as such are crucial to understand the evolution towards high body mass in land mammals. In this study, we investigate the shape variation of the six limb long bones among the modern elephants, Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana, to understand the effect of body mass and habitat on the external anatomy of the bones. To do so, we use three-dimensional geometric morphometrics (GMMs) and qualitative comparisons to describe the shape variation, at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. Our results reveal that the two species share similar negative ontogenetic allometric patterns (i.e. becoming stouter with increased length) in their humerus and femur, but not in the other bones: the proximal epiphyses of the stylopod bones develop considerably during growth, while the distal epiphyses, which are involved in load distribution in the elbow and knee joints, are already massive in juveniles. We attribute this pattern to a weight-bearing adaptation already present in young specimens. Among adults of the same species, bone robustness increases with body mass, so that heavier specimens display stouter bones allowing for a better mechanical load distribution. While this robustness variation is significant for the humerus only, all the other bones appear to follow the same pattern. This is particularly visible in the ulna and tibia, but less so in the femur, which suggests that the forelimb and hindlimb adapted differently to high body mass support. Robustness analyses, while significant for the humerus only, suggest more robust long bones in Asian elephants than in African savanna elephants. More specifically, GMMs and qualitative comparisons indicate that three bones are clearly distinct when comparing the two species: in E. maximus the humerus, the ulna and the tibia display enlarged areas of muscular insertions for muscles involved in joint and limb stabilization, as well as in limb rotation. These results suggest a higher limb compliance in Asian elephants, associated with a higher dexterity, which could be linked to their habitat and foraging habits.

To exploit its technological capabilities, it is important to determine its fundamental properties including the lattice dynamics. The TiS2 phonon dispersion curves available to date do not reproduce properly the experimental data for several reasons: i) all available experimental data are not taken into consideration, thus poor theory-experiment agreements have been obtained; ii) the (unknown) frequency of the infrared mode A(2u) is erroneously assumed; and iii) such incorrect assignment has propagated in the literature, particularly in phonon dispersion calculations. It is presented here a thorough density functional theory analysis to determine the phonon dispersion curves of TiS2, accounting for the frequencies of all experimental phonon data available to date. These include the frequencies of nine zone-edge Raman active modes of Ag-intercalated TiS2, in addition to infrared, Raman, and neutron scattering data. An incorrect frequency assignment of the A(2u) mode in the literature is thoroughly discussed. Moreover, results of attenuated total reflection terahertz spectroscopy applied to TiS2 are provided. A self-intercalation paradigm is presented to give a rationale for the temperature dependence of the poorly understood Raman features observed in pristine TiS2 at frequencies above the A(1g) mode.

Five years on, this qualitative policy content analysis examined the key achievements promoted by 32 councils under the first generation of plans, and also identified where action has been limited. Councils were found to have invested significantly in making improvements to the built environment. Hosting accessible events and programmes was also a commonly reported achievement, as was facilitating access to accessible information and technology. Councils took proactive roles in supporting and educating communities, business and their employees in inclusive practice. There were many achievements related to employment opportunities; however, these were generally narrow in expectation and impact, suggesting this was the area councils struggled with most. Councils also showed they were forecasting ahead, outlining consultative processes and policy changes, which would influence systemic improvements in accessibility and inclusion into the future. Councils have taken significant steps to advance the inclusion agenda; however, there remain areas where greater attention and support are required.

So far, the phase engineering methods are intensively explored, serving as practical tools for discovering low-cost novel nanomaterials for electronic and electrode devices in the realm of energy storage and catalysis. However, the heterostructures between 2H/1T, 2H/1T ', or 1T/1T ', functionalizing as critical active sites in the electrocatalytic process, are overlooked. Herein, a facile carbon doping paradigms, enabling augmentation of MoS2 phase transition, together with density functional theory calculations and rationales to explain the counterintuitive directionality of transitions is reported. The experiment and simulation results indicate that the existence of carbon as interstitial atoms is more favorable to the phase transition than the substitution atoms. The heterogeneous interfaces between 2H and 1T or 1T ' are more conducive to charge transfer. As expected, the trinary-heterostructure nanofilm displays excellent electrocatalytic activities both in micro-electrochemical measurements and conventional electrolytic cells. The results provide a fresh insight into the 2D-TMDs phase transition mechanism and guide for trinary-heterostructure electrocatalysts for scalable production.

Comparison of the effects of earnings management on the financial cost between companies in developed and emerging European countries	JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE			English	Article						cost of debt; cost of equity; earnings management; idiosyncratic risk; systematic risk	REAL ACTIVITIES MANIPULATION; IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK; ACCRUALS; QUALITY; PROTECTION; DEBT; FIRM	Empirical studies found that earnings management (EM) explains firms' cost of capital both in companies in emerging and developed countries, but until now, it has not been analyzed whether the effect of EM on the financial cost is different among emerging countries inside or outside an economic area (Eurozone). Our results show that the cost of debt and the idiosyncratic component of the cost of equity are related to discretionary accruals and abnormal values of operating cash-flows, that the emerging country effect is more relevant on the cost of debt, that there is a Eurozone effect that makes discretionary accruals more relevant than abnormal values of operating cash-flow and that firms in emerging countries inside the Eurozone benefit from a lower EM penalty on the cost of debt than firms in other emerging European countries.

To investigate the relationship between absorption behaviors of volatile aromas and the processes-induced variations in protein microstructures and molecular conformations, duck liver protein isolate (DLp) was subjected to heating (65/100 degrees C, 15 min) and ultra-high pressure (UHP, 100-500 MPa/10 min, 28 degrees C) treatments to obtain differential unfolded protein states. RESULTSHeat and UHP treatments induced the unfolding of DLp to varied degrees, as revealed by fluorescence spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption, circular dichroism spectra and surface hydrophobicity measurements. Two types of heating-denatured states with varied unfolding degrees were obtained, while UHP at both levels of 100/500 MPa caused partial unfolding of DLp and the presence of a molten-globule state, which significantly enhanced the binding affinity between DLp and (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal. In particular, significantly modified secondary structures of DLp were observed in heating-denatured samples. Excessive denaturing and unfolding degrees resulted in no significant changes in the absorption behavior of the volatile ligand, as characterized by observations of fluorescence quenching and analysis of headspace concentrations. CONCLUSIONDefining process-induced conformational transition behavior of matrix proteins could be a promising strategy to regulate food flavor attributes and, particularly, to produce DLp coextracted with limited off-flavor components by modifying their interaction during extraction processes.

The aim was to analyze the pattern of HRU prior to death by suicide or suicide attempt in patients with MDD using national registries. MethodsDanish adults with MDD, who died by suicide or had a first-time suicide attempt, were matched with MDD controls on age, sex, and MDD severity and analyzed for psychiatric and non-psychiatric hospital and private practitioner contacts, and prescriptions 1 year prior to the event. For individuals having a second suicide attempt, HRU prior to first and second suicide attempt was analyzed. ResultsAmong 1061 individuals dying by suicide and 3759 individuals with suicide attempt, compared with their controls, the proportion with psychiatric hospitalization was more than 50% increased, mainly accounted for by acute contacts. The difference to the matched controls decreased with increasing MDD severity. Non-psychiatric HRU was increased as well. The proportion with psychiatric hospitalizations or ED visits was reduced prior to the second attempt compared with first attempt. ConclusionAmong individuals with MDD, psychiatric and non-psychiatric HRU was increased 1 year prior to suicide event. The proportion of individuals who had psychiatric HRU decreased from first to second suicide attempt.

Visible-light photoelectrocatalysts from abundant resources will play a key role in exploiting solar irradiation. Anionic doping via pre-organization of precursors and further co-polymerization creates tuneable semiconductors. Triazole derivative-purpald, an unexplored precursor with sulfur (S) container, combined in different initial ratios with melamine during one solid-state polycondensation with two thermal steps yields hybrid S-doped carbon nitrides (C3N4). The series of S-doped/C3N4-based materials show enhanced optical, electronic, structural, textural, and morphological properties and exhibit higher performance in organic benzylamine photooxidation, oxygen evolution, and similar energy storage (capacitor brief investigation). 50M-50P exhibits the highest photooxidation conversion (84 +/- 3%) of benzylamine to imine at 535 nm - green light for 48 h, due to a discrete shoulder (approximate to 700) nm, high sulfur content, preservation of crystal size, new intraband energy states, structural defects by layer distortion, and 10-16 nm pores with arbitrary depth. This work innovates by studying the concomitant relationships between: 1) the precursor decomposition while C3N4 is formed, 2) the insertion of S impurities, 3) the S-doped C3N4 property-activity relationships, and 4) combinatorial surface, bulk, structural, optical, and electronic characterization analysis. This work contributes to the development of disordered long-visible-light photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and storage.

This study investigated the preventive effects of sodium ferrous citrate (SFC) and 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate (ALA) on several metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity because they have been shown to alleviate abnormal glucose metabolism in humans. MethodsSix-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a normal diet, a high-fat diet, or a high-fat diet supplemented with SFC and ALA for 15 weeks. ResultsThe simultaneous supplementation of SFC + ALA to high-fat diet-fed mice prevented loss of muscle mass, improved muscle strength, and reduced obesity and insulin resistance. SFC + ALA prevented abnormalities in mitochondrial morphology and reverted the diet effect on the skeletal muscle transcriptome, including the expression of glucose uptake and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-related genes. In addition, SFC + ALA prevented the decline in mitochondrial DNA copy number by enhancing mitochondrial DNA maintenance and antioxidant transcription activity, both of which are impaired in high-fat diet-fed mice during long-term fasting. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that SFC + ALA supplementation exerts its preventive effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus via improved skeletal muscle and mitochondrial health, further validating its application as a promising strategy for the prevention of obesity-induced metabolic disorders.

Revisiting the N(N+1)/2-site s-type Gaussian charge model for permutationally invariant polynomial fitting of global molecular tensor surfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY			English	Article						distributed multipoles; linear regressions; molecular dynamics; multipole tensor surfaces; permutationally invariant polynomials	TRANSFERABLE INTERACTION MODELS; POTENTIAL-ENERGY SURFACE; DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; INFRARED-SPECTRUM; FORCE-FIELD; MULTIPOLE MODEL; 1ST PRINCIPLES; WATER MODEL; QUANTUM; MECHANICS	The exact expressions for the dipole, quadrupole, and octupoles of a collection of N point charges involve summations of corresponding tensors over the N sites weighted by their charge magnitudes. When the point charges are atoms (in a molecule) the N-site formula is an approximation, and one must integrate over the electron density to recover the exact multipoles. In the present work we revisit the N(N + 1)/2-site point charge density model of Hall (Chem. Phys. Lett. 6, 501, 1973) for the purpose of fitting ab initio derived multipole moment hypersurfaces using permutationally invariant polynomials (PIP). We examine new approaches in PIP-fitting procedures for the dipole, quadrupole, octupole moments, and polarizability tensor surfaces (DMS, QMS, OMS and PTS, respectively) for a non-polar CCl4 and a polar CHCl3 and show that compared to the primitive N-site model the N(N + 1)/2-site model appreciably improves the relative RMSE of the DMS and does much more substantially so, by an order of magnitude, for the corresponding ones of QMS and OMS. Training datasets are obtained by sampling potential energies up to 18 000 cm(-1) above the global minima, generated by molecular dynamics simulations at the DFT B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory.

J	Kwon, CK				Kwon, Chang-kyu			Resistance from the margin: An autoethnographic account of academic ableism	HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY			English	Article; Early Access						ableism; academic ableism; critical human resource development; disability; social justice	DISABLED ACADEMICS; DISABILITY; DIVERSITY; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCES; WORKPLACE; IDENTITY; PEOPLE; WORK; SELF	Ableism-which refers to a socially-sanctioned preference for normative bodies and minds, and which presumes one's abilities-is prevalent in any social system, including academia. However, despite an evolving disciplinary identity that seeks to improve work systems by addressing critical social issues, human resource development (HRD) as a field has done little to understand or advocate for the experiences of academics with disabilities. To challenge directly prevailing ableist assumptions and practices in academia, the present autoethnographic study was undertaken to reflect upon and detail my own experience of becoming an academic with a disability, specifically in the field of HRD. The story presented in this article presents evidence of unique challenges and opportunities facing an academic with a disability and seeks to stimulate meaningful dialogue around how to create a welcoming and inclusive academic culture for all. This article also advances autoethnography as a viable research methodology that allows for the authentic voices of members from marginalized communities and mobilizes change.

In particular, the enhanced photocurrent response could be attributed to the enhanced optical absorption of visible light from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of gold nanoparticles in the hierarchical structure of BiOCl layered. To realize the biological detection process, an immunoreaction was implemented between target PSA and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-labeled anti-PSA antibodies. With the formation of ternary sandwich immunocomplex, the carried and loaded ALP catalysed the substrate ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) to generate ascorbic acid for increasing the photocurrent intensity of BiOCl-Au/FTO. Under optimum reaction time, the photocurrent peak intensity of BiOCl-Au/FTO increased with the increasing of target PSA concentration in the range of 0.01 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 2.3 pg/mL. In the photocurrent control experiment, the photocurrent of BiOCl-Au/FTO was not only higher than that of BiOCl/FTO, but also showed greater changes in photocurrent under the same target PSA concentration. Impressively, the proposed split-type PEC immunoassay was applied to detect PSA concentration in human serum samples, giving acceptable and satisfactory accuracy compared with the gold standard PSA ELISA method.

Herein, 3D phytic acid (PA) and phytic acid dipotassium (PAD) with polydentate are explored to synchronously passivate the defects of perovskite absorber directly in multiple spatial directions. The strong electron-donating groups (-H2PO4) in the PA molecule afford six anchor sites to bind firmly with uncoordinated Pb2+ at the GBs/surface and modulate perovskite crystallization, thus enhancing the quality of perovskite film. Particularly, PAD containing an additional (K -> P(sic)O) push-pull structure promotes the dominant coordination of phosphate group (P(sic)O) with Pb2+ and passivates halide anion defects due to the complexation of potassium ions (K+) with iodide ions (I-). Consequently, the PAD-complexed PSCs deliver a champion PCE of 23.18%, which is remarkably higher than that of the control device (19.94%). Meanwhile, PAD-complexed PSCs exhibit superior moisture and thermal stability, remaining 79% of their initial PCE after 1000 h under continuous illumination, while the control device remain only 48% of their PCE after 1000 h. This work provides important insights into designing multifunctional 3D passivators for the purpose of simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and stability of devices.

The aim of this study is to determine if SRUS is associated with hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). Study Design and MethodsRetrospective data were collected from eight institutions over an 11-year study period (2010-2020), when available (5/8 sites). The outcome of the pregnancies with SRUS-no, mild, moderate, or severe HDFN-was determined. ResultsSRUS was demonstrated in 589 pregnancies. After excluding those with incomplete data, a total of 284 pregnancies were included in the primary HDFN outcome analysis. SRUS was detected in 124 (44%) pregnancies in isolation, and none were affected by HDFN. Of 41 pregnancies with SRUS and ABO incompatibility, 37 (90%) were unaffected, and 4 (10%) were associated with mild HDFN. Of 98 pregnancies with SRUS and concurrent identifiable antibody reactivity(s), 80 (81%) were unaffected, and 19 (19%) were associated with mild to severe HDFN. There was 1 case of mild HDFN and 1 case of severe HDFN in the 21 pregnancies with SRUS, ABO incompatibility, and concurrent identifiable antibody reactivity(s), and 19 (90%) were unaffected by HDFN. Among all patients with repeat testing, newly identified alloantibodies or other antibodies were identified in 63 of 212 (30%) patients. Although most were not clinically significant, on occasion SRUS preceded clinically significant antibody(s) associated with HDFN (3%, 5/188). ConclusionThe antenatal serologic finding of SRUS in isolation is not associated with HDFN but may precede clinically significant antibodies.

Data were used from six weather stations belonging to the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - the National Research Institute (IMWM-NRI), where CBH was first measured using the IWO device and, since the 1990s, using a ceilometer. The analysis allowed for data from eight observation periods (0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100 UTC), which referred to several height ranges (between the ground surface and 2500 m a.s.l.). In the analysed multiyear period, in the cool half of the year, the height of the Cumulonimbus cloud bases increased significantly, that is, the number of cases increased at a height of > 1000 m and, in the warm half of the year, at > 1500 m. In recent years, the number of cases of the Cumulus cloud with a base at a height between 300 and 999 m has clearly decreased, while it has increased at a height of 1000-1499 m (in October-March) and 1500-1999 m (April-September). A similar increase in CBH was found in the case of the Stratocumulus cloud (their greater share between 1500 and 2499 m). It was only in the case of the Stratus cloud that a lowering of the cloud base was noticed, possibly owing to the imperfect measurement of the fractus species. The positive upward trend in the base height of most low-level clouds can be explained by a statistically significant increase in temperature and a decrease in relative air humidity in the lower troposphere.

The process of ion diffusion and ion exchange during surface corrosion is explained at the initial stages. We have reported a unique subsurface activity in the glass, which achieves equilibrium. This varies at the subsurface depth level of approximate to 10-30 nm and is visible as a broad peak in the elemental depth profile. The prolonged corrosion and heating process assists surface relaxation of the glass samples. We have observed the formation of active nucleation sites for the corrosion process on the surface. In this study, we report that the sodium ions and its corrosion compounds are decoupled from other metal ions present in the glass during diffusion relaxation and ion exchange. A combination of time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis help to explain the evolution and quantify the changes at the initial stages in the freshly formed glass surface.

The quality assessment and data extraction of the studies were performed. ResultsA total of 2176 studies were screened. The titles and abstracts of the studies were then reviewed (n = 346), and 52 studies met the search criteria. Following the full-text review, 11 studies investigated the effect of SDF against other treatments such as chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride, ammonium bifluoride, tricalcium silicate paste, casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate, glass ionomer cement (GIC) combined with fluoride varnish, resin-modified GIC, and atraumatic restorative treatment were assessed. ConclusionsWithin the limitations of this review, the use of SDF is promising with high preventative fractions in permanent teeth of children and older populations when compared to other topical applications such as dental varnish containing sodium fluoride.

A cohort study	NURSING OPEN			English	Article						body mass index; frail elderly; health care disparities; hip fractures; missed care; nurses; nursing; process measures; quality of health care	MORTALITY; COMORBIDITY; REGISTRY; QUALITY	Aim: To examine whether patients' body mass index is associated with missed hip fracture care consistent with national guideline-recommended care.Design: A nationwide, population -based cohort study using prospectively collected data from the Danish Multidisciplinary Hip Fracture Registry. Methods: The study population consisted of 39,835 patients >= 65 years admitted with a hip fracture and discharged between 1st of January 2012 and 29th of November 2017. National guideline-recommended care consists of preoperative optimization, early surgery, mobilization within 24 h, basic mobility assessment, nutrition screening, post-discharge rehabilitation program, and osteoporotic and fall prophylaxis. We used binomial regression to estimate the relative risk for the fulfilment of the individual measures with 95% confidence interval. Multiple imputation method was applied to handle missing values of body mass index.Results: The overall fulfilment of the individual measures ranged from 43% for preoperative optimization to 95% for receiving a post-discharge rehabilitation program. The obese patients had a lower fulfilment of surgery within 36 h compared to pa- tients with normal weight. No differences in fulfilment of the other measures were found. However, patients with missing data on body mass index had the highest risk of missed care. In conclusion, patients with missing BMI values had the highest risk of missed care. The obese patients had a slightly higher risk of long waiting times for surgery than normal-weighted patients.No Patient or Public Contribution: This study was done based on population -based data from medical registries and data was analysed by the authors only.

The inclusion criteria were non-missing serial magnetic resonance imaging studies and clinical baseline metrics such as vascular risk factors. The exclusion criteria were patients who underwent surgical CM removal and patients with less than a decade of follow -up. Kaplan- Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the cumulative risk (10 years) of hemorrhage.Results: Eighty -nine patients with a CM of the CNS were included. Our results showed a non-significant increased risk of hemorrhage during 10 years of follow -up in patients using nicotine (hazard ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval 0.86- 5.21) and in patients with diabetes (hazard ratio 3.25, 95% confidence interval 0.71- 14.81). For the presence of modifiable vascular risk factors at study baseline different cumulative 10 -year risks of bleeding were observed: arterial hypertension 42.9% (18.8%- 70.4%); diabetes 66.7% (12.5%- 98.2%); hyperlipidemia 30% (8.1%- 64.6%); active nicotine abuse 50% (24.1%- 76%); and obesity 22.2% (4%- 59.8%). Overall cumulative (10 -year) hemorrhage risk was 30.3% (21.3%- 41.1%). Conclusions: The probability of hemorrhage in untreated CNS CM patients increases progressively within a decade of follow -up. None of the modifiable vascular risk factors showed strong indication for an influence on hemorrhage risk, but our findings may suggest a more aggressive course in patients with active nicotine abuse or suffering from diabetes.

This case report describes an interdisciplinary digital workflow combined with CAD/CAM natural restorations to achieve the naturalness of an anterior rehabilitation. Clinical considerations: A 38-year-old patient attended to the office with esthetic issues. An interdisciplinary treatment plan was conducted, which included periodontal surgery to recreate the gingival contour, associated with bleaching and manufacturing CAD/CAM ceramic veneers to return an optimal teeth surface texture and shape. ConclusionsThe design and manufacturing of CAD/CAM natural restorations using a digital workflow allowed a predictable result and overcame the limitations of conventional shell technique. Clinical SignificanceConventional shell technique is used to create restorations with the form and texture of natural teeth. This article presents a combination of the conventional shell technique with a digital workflow, facilitating the design and manufacturing of CAD/CAM natural restorations.

However, damage to the stress-bearing system in the intervertebral disc (IVD) mediated by the excessive decomposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells caused by local stimulation is widely considered the core pathological process underlying IVDD. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plays a protective role in various chronic diseases. However, whether it can have such effects in IVDD has not been clearly reported. In recent years, in-depth research on the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear-enriched transcript 1 (NEAT1) in various diseases has continuously emerged, but such research in the field of IVD is not sufficient. In this study, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was used to induce oxidative stress in human NP cells and construct a cell model of excessive ECM decomposition in vitro. A plasmid over-expressing lncRNA NEAT1 was introduced into human NP cells to establish an NP cell model. For this specific experiment, Cell Counting Kit 8 was used to explore the timing and concentration of DHA and TBHP activity. A common gene chip platform was also used to select potential lncRNAs. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were used to detect the expression of ECM-related proteins in NP cells in each group. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of lncRNA NEAT1 in NP cells in each group. On this basis, we proved that DHA alleviates excessive degradation of the ECM in NP cells in response to oxidative stress by reducing the content of lncRNA NEAT1. In conclusion, our study reveals the mechanism through which DHA relieves excessive ECM decomposition in NP cells and provides a potential new idea for the treatment of IVDD in clinical practice.

This cross-sectional study aimed to characterise sleep quality in day workers, 8 and 12 h rotating shift pattern workers. One hundred eighty-six officers volunteered for the study (37 female, age: 41 +/- 7). Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, actigraphy and the Leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire. The maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) was measured on a treadmill via breath-by-breath analysis. There was a 70% overall prevalence of poor sleepers based on Pittsburgh sleep quality index scores, where 8 h shifts exhibited the worst prevalence (92%, p = 0.029), however, there was no difference between age, gender, or role. In contrast, 12 h shifts exhibited the poorest short-term measures, including awakening from sleep (p = 0.039) and behaviour following wakefulness (p = 0.033) from subjective measures, and poorer total sleep time (p = 0.024) and sleep efficiency (p = 0.024) from the actigraphy. High VO2max predicted poorer wake after sleep onset (Rsq = 0.07, p = 0.05) and poorer sleep latency (p = 0.028). There was no relationship between the Pittsburgh sleep quality index scores and any of the short-term measures. The prevalence of poor sleepers in this cohort was substantially higher than in the general population, regardless of shift pattern. The results obtained from the long- and short-term measures of sleep quality yielded opposing results, where long-term perceptions favoured the 12 h pattern, but short-term subjective and objective measures both favoured the 8 h pattern.

This paper aimed to examine the problem from a wellbeing perspective, offering implications for research, and potential solutions for organisations. Design: Discursive/Position paper. Method: The discussion is based on the nursing and wellbeing literature. It is guided by the authors' collaborative expertise as both clinicians and researchers. Data were drawn from nursing and wellbeing peer-reviewed literature, such as reviews and empirical studies, national surveys and government and thinktank publications/reports. Results: Critical care nurses have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with studies consistently showing critical care nurses to have the worst psychological outcomes on wellbeing measures, including depression, burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These findings are not only concerning for the mental wellbeing of critical care nurses, they also raise significant issues for healthcare systems/organisations: poor wellbeing, increased burnout and PTSD are directly linked with critical care nurses intending to leave the profession. Thus, the wellbeing of critical care nurses must urgently be supported. Resilience has been identified as a protective mechanism against the development of PTSD and burnout, thus offering evidence-based interventions that address resilience and turnover have much to offer in tackling the workforce crisis. However, turnover data must be collected by studies evaluating resilience interventions, to further support their evidence base. Organisations cannot solely rely on the efficacy of these interventions to address their workforce crisis but must concomitantly engage in organisational change. Conclusions: We conclude that critical care nurses are in urgent need of preventative, evidence-based wellbeing interventions, and make suggestions for research and practice.

Here, bran husks were replaced with fresh bamboo to brew light-aroma Baijiu. Flavor components in Jiupei and Baijiu were detected through headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and physicochemical properties were assessed; flavor results were obtained from correlation, principal component, and cluster analyses. Starch and reducing sugar content in Jiupei negatively correlated with moisture, alcohol content, and acidity. Fresh bamboo reduced furfural from bran husks in Jiupei by 88.5% and increased alcohol distillation by 51%; it also improved starch efficiency (5%). Surprisingly, isovanillin was found to be present in Baijiu. Total Baijiu yield (57% +/- 2.01%) was attained when crushed bamboo size was 1.5 cm x 0.3 cm x 0.3 cm. This study supports the use of fresh bamboo (an eco-friendly alternative for husks) in brewing light-aroma Baijiu. Practical ApplicationThe use of fresh bamboo as a replacement for rice husks in brewing light-aroma Baijiu was investigated. It attenuated the chaff taste in light-aroma Baijiu and increased the liquor yield. Surprisingly, isovanillin was also present in the base Baijiu, and it added to the fragrance. This study not only supports the use of bamboo as an auxiliary material for brewing light-aroma Baijiu but also provides a reference for brewing light-aroma Baijiu with alternative auxiliary materials.

Best practices for addressing missing data through multiple imputation	INFANT AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						development; missing data; missingness mechanisms; multiple imputation; open scholarship	OF-LIFE DATA; FULLY CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION; PATTERN-MIXTURE MODELS; DATA DESIGNS; CHAINED EQUATIONS; PSYCHOLOGY; SCIENCE; UNDERREPRESENTATION; PREREGISTRATION; TRIALS	A common challenge in developmental research is the amount of incomplete and missing data that occurs from respondents failing to complete tasks or questionnaires, as well as from disengaging from the study (i.e., attrition). This missingness can lead to biases in parameter estimates and, hence, in the interpretation of findings. These biases can be addressed through statistical techniques that adjust for missing data, such as multiple imputation. Although multiple imputation is highly effective, it has not been widely adopted by developmental scientists given barriers such as lack of training or misconceptions about imputation methods. Utilizing default methods within statistical software programs like listwise deletion is common but may introduce additional bias. This manuscript is intended to provide practical guidelines for developmental researchers to follow when examining their data for missingness, making decisions about how to handle that missingness and reporting the extent of missing data biases and specific multiple imputation procedures in publications.

However, the commonly used methods to incorporate prior information provide a model for the mean function of the outcome and rely on unmet assumptions. To address these concerns, we propose a method for nonparametric additive quantile regression with network regularization to incorporate the information encoded by known networks. To account for nonlinear associations, we approximate the unknown additive functional effect of each predictor with the expansion of a B-spline basis. We implement the group Lasso penalty to obtain a sparse model. We define the network-constrained penalty by the total l2$$ {\ell}_2 $$ norm of the difference between the effect functions of any two linked genes in the known network. We further propose an efficient computation procedure to solve the optimization problem that arises in our model. Simulation studies show that our proposed method performs well in identifying more truly associated genes and less falsely associated genes than alternative approaches. We apply the proposed method to analyze the microarray gene-expression dataset in the Framingham Heart Study and identify several 75 percentile BMI associated genes. In conclusion, our proposed approach efficiently identifies the outcome-associated variables in a nonparametric additive quantile regression framework by leveraging known network information.

MethodsA single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 270 patients undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis more than 3 months were included. The interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-gamma ELISPOT) assay was used for the diagnosis of LTBI. Primary endpoints were MACE, including all-cause death and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The association between LTBI and MACE was examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression after adjusting for covariates and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. ResultsIn our study, the patients were classified into LTBI (n = 47) or non-LTBI (n = 223) groups. Independent risk factors for LTBI in dialysis population were prior tuberculosis (TB) history (odds ratio [OR] 4.817 [1.064-22.306]), tobacco use (OR 2.903 [1.155-7.299]), and older age (OR 1.027 [1.002-1.053]). After a median follow-up of 39 months, the incidence of active TB was 6.4% versus 0% in dialysis patients with and without LTBI, respectively (p = 0.005). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that LTBI was significantly associated with MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 2.540 [1.490-4.350]) after adjustment for potential confounders. ConclusionsPrior TB history, tobacco use, and the elderly can be used to select cost-effective LTBI screening target groups in dialysis patients. LTBI is not only closely related to active TB but also an independent risk factor for higher incidence of MACE in dialysis population.

Poly(Ionic Liquid) as an Anion Exchange Membrane for a 3.3 V Copper-Lithium Battery	ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS			English	Article						anion exchange membrane; copper cathode; cycle stability; ion transport; metal-metal battery; poly(ionic liquid)	COMPOSITE POLYMER ELECTROLYTES; ION; POLYPROPYLENE; CONDUCTIVITY; SPECTROSCOPY	Metal-metal battery bears great potential for next-generation large-scale energy storage system because of its simple manufacture process and low production cost. However, the cross-over of metal cations from the cathode to the anode causes a loss in capacity and influences battery stability. Herein, a coating of poly (ionic liquid) (PIL) with poly(diallyldimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) (PDADMA(+)TFSI(-)) on a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator serves as an anion exchange membrane for a 3.3 V copper-lithium battery. The PIL has a positively charged polymer backbone that can block the migration of copper ions, thus improving Coulombic efficiency, long-term cycling stability and inhibiting self-discharge of the battery. It can also facilitate the conduction of anions through the membrane and reduce polarization, especially for fast charging/discharging. Bruce-Vincent method gives the transport number in the electrolyte to be 0.25 and 0.04 for PP separator without and with PIL coating, respectively. This suggests that the PIL layer reduces the contribution of the internal current due to cation transport. The use of PIL as a coating layer for commercial PP separator is a cost-effective way to improve overall electrochemical performance of copper-lithium batteries. Compared to PP and polyacrylic acid(PAA)/PP separators, the PIL/PP membrane raises the Coulombic efficiency to 99% and decreases the average discharge voltage drop to about 0.09 V when the current density is increased from 0.1 to 1 mA cm(-2).

The current status and problems in PMS/PMDD diagnosis and treatment were surveyed in this cross-sectional study.ResultsIn total, 1312 respondents (7.8% of all JSOG members) completed the questionnaire. In terms of diagnoses and treatment, OB/GYN was preferred over psychiatrist for PMS (91.4% vs. 45%); however, no differences were noted for PMDD (76.1% vs. 73.7%). A total of 1267 (96.6%) respondents engaged in routine PMS/PMDD treatment. Regarding the general diagnosis procedure, 84.4% respondents answered "only a vague medical interview, " 8.4% kept a two-cycle symptom diary, and 10.3% used a screening questionnaire. The most commonly used medication was oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (98.1%), followed by the Kampo, traditional Japanese herbal medicines, Kamishoyosan (73.6%). Concerning first-line drugs for treatment, OCPs were the most common (76.8%), followed by Kampo medicine (19.5%); selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were less frequently used (2.6%). Regarding first-line drugs among OCPs, 65.1% respondents reported drospirenone-ethinylestradriol use.ConclusionsThis study indicates that only a few OB/GYNs practicing PMS/PMDD in Japan use a prospective diary, which is an essential diagnostic criterion for PMS/PMDD. Regarding treatment, SSRIs were used less frequently.

MethodsThe study includes 39 participants with cirrhosis Child-Pugh class A/B who participated in a prior clinical trial randomized to either resistance training three times per week for 12 weeks or a control group. We gathered data through medical records from trial entry and the following 3 years. The outcomes were time to first hospitalization and all-cause mortality. We used regression models to examine the associations between trial groups and outcomes, adjusting for Child-Pugh class, age, gender, and comorbidity. ResultsNine patients who trained and 15 controls were hospitalized, resulting in a lower risk of first hospitalization in the training group (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio of 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.17, 0.92]; P = 0.03). One patient who trained and six controls died, resulting in a lower all-cause mortality in the training group (adjusted hazard ratio of 0.06, 95% CI [0.01, 0.66]; P = 0.02). ConclusionTwelve weeks of resistance training was associated with a reduced risk of first hospitalization and mortality among patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh class A/B 3 years after trial entry. The mechanisms of this effect are not identified, and larger studies are warranted.

The objective of this study was to investigate the possible toxic mechanism of sevoflurane through the WNK1/NKCC1/Ca2+/Drp-1 signalling pathway. The hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell line was used in this study. The intervention group was treated with the WNK1 inhibitor WNK-463, CaN inhibitor FK506 and Drp-1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 respectively in the medium for 30 min before sevoflurane anaesthesia. The sevofluane group and all intervention group treated with 4.1% sevoflurane for 6 h. Compared with the control group, sevoflurane treatment decreased cell viability and increased cellular apoptosis. Our study found that WNK-463, FK506 and Mdivi-1 can all alleviate the sevoflurane-induced reduction in cell viability, decrease the cell apoptosis. In addition, WNK-463 pretreatment could inhibit the increase of WNK1 kinase and NKCC1 protein concentration caused by sevoflurane. Further, sevoflurane anaesthesia causes intracellular calcium overload, increases the expression of CaN and induces the dephosphorylation of Drp-1 protein at ser637, while CaN inhibitor FK506 pretreatment could reduce the dephosphorylation of Drp-1. Therefore, the WNK1/NKCC1/Ca2+/Drp-1 signalling pathway plays an important role in sevoflurane-related neurotoxicity. Reducing intracellular calcium influx may be one of the important mechanism to ameliorate sevoflurane toxicity.

J	Bicho, M; Nikolaeva, R; Lages, C				Bicho, Marta; Nikolaeva, Ralitza; Lages, Carmen			Complementary and Alternative Medicine legitimation efforts in a hostile environment: The case of Portugal	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article						complementary and alternative medicine; hostile environment; hybrid organisations; legitimacy	HEALTH; CONSTRUCTION; ORGANIZATION; BOUNDARIES; TRUST	This article explores complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) organisations' legitimation efforts that face extra obstacles as they are subject to more than one institutional logics (hybrids) and operate in a contested organisational space (hostile environment). CAM organisations espouse the health and market logics and their practices are questioned at an institutional level. The study is conducted in Portugal, where the legalisation of CAM therapies was a contested process over 10 years. Taking an abductive approach and drawing on qualitative interviews, the authors analyse CAM managers' efforts to legitimise their practices and build viable organisations despite hostile conditions. Contrary to prior studies of hybrid healthcare organisations, CAM organisations derive moral legitimacy from the market logic rather than the health logic. The findings show that relationships, trust-building and consumer education appear to be the primary vehicles for establishing pragmatic legitimacy. Thus, pragmatic legitimacy relies on the health logic. The market logic dominates the pursuit of moral legitimacy through financial sustainability, human capital, marketing communications and partnerships, and advocating complementarity with biomedicine. We propose a model through which organisations use pragmatic legitimacy to enhance moral legitimacy and to create recursive feedback between moral and pragmatic legitimacy on the path to cognitive legitimacy.

Understanding the impact of the pandemic on nurses and effective strategies to support them is critical for increasing nurse resilience and reducing burnout. AimsThe aims of this study were (1) to synthesize the literature examining how factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic affected the well-being and safety of nurses (2) and to review interventions which may promote nurse mental health during crises. MethodsUsing an integrative review approach, a comprehensive search of the literature was conducted in March 2022 using the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane. We included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method primary research articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals from March 2020 through February 2021. Included articles focused on nurses caring for COVID-19 patients and addressed psychological factors, supportive hospital leadership strategies, or interventions to support well-being. Studies were excluded if they focused on professions outside of nursing. Included articles were summarized and appraised for quality. Findings were synthesized using content analysis. ResultsOf the 130 articles initially identified, 17 were included. Articles were quantitative (n = 11), qualitative (n = 5), and mixed methods (n = 1). Three themes were identified: (1) loss of life, hope, and professional identity; (2) lack of visible and supportive leadership; and (3) insufficient planning and response. These experiences contributed to increased symptoms of anxiety, stress, depression, and moral distress in nurses.

However, conventional negative pressure sources (e.g., diaphragm vacuum pumps) suffer from poor scalability from meso- to microscale, unavoidable vibration and noise, while the performances of existing smart material-driven suction cups are often restricted by their bulky structures, poor active adhesive stresses, or high power consumptions. To address these limitations, a monolithic suction pad is proposed where its active adhesion is realized by the electrostatic-hydraulic coupling generated negative pressure cavity and the sealing is achieved by the elastomeric-hydraulic coupled outer rim. This suction pad features a peak pull-off stress of 7.4 kPa and good switch ability in its adhesive stress of over 12 times. Compared with the existing smart material-driven suction cups, the proposed suction pad demonstrates clear advantages in its significantly lower profile structure, lower preload stress requirement, and a higher adhesive force to power consumption ratio. This suction pad is envisioned to have promises in broad applications such as digital manufacturing, transfer printing, medical robotics, and robotic locomotion.

The genetic and molecular bases of these effects remain mostly unknown, in particular in the root system, which is responsible for plant nutrient uptake. To gain knowledge about the effect of elevated CO2 on plant growth and physiology, and to identify its regulatory in the roots, we analyzed genome expression in Arabidopsis roots through a combinatorial design with contrasted levels of CO2, nitrate, and iron. We demonstrated that elevated CO2 has a modest effect on root genome expression under nutrient sufficiency, but by contrast leads to massive expression changes under nitrate or iron deficiencies. We demonstrated that elevated CO2 negatively targets nitrate and iron starvation modules at the transcriptional level, associated with a reduction in high-affinity nitrate uptake. Finally, we inferred a gene regulatory network governing the root response to elevated CO2. This network allowed us to identify candidate transcription factors including MYB15, WOX11, and EDF3 which we experimentally validated for their role in the stimulation of growth by elevated CO2. Our approach identified key features and regulators of the plant response to elevated CO2, with the objective of developing crops resilient to climate change.

Nonetheless, formation of zinc dendrites and side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the zinc plating/stripping process affect the cycling reversibility of the zinc anode. Regulation of the zinc plating/stripping process and realizing a highly reversible zinc anode is a great challenge. Herein, we applied a simple and effective approach of controlled-current zinc pre-deposition at copper mesh. At the current density of 40 mA cm(-2), where the electron/ion transfers are both continuous and balanced, the Zn@CM-40 electrode with the (002) crystal plane orientation and the compactly aligned platelet morphology was successfully obtained. Compared with the zinc foil, the Zn@CM-40 exhibits greatly enhanced reversibility in the repeated plating/stripping (850 h at 1 mA cm(-2)) for the symmetric battery test. A series of characterization techniques including electrochemical analyses, XRD, SEM and optical microscopy observation, were used to demonstrate the correlation between the structure of pre-deposited zinc layer and the cycling stability. The COSMOL Multiphysics modeling demonstrates a more uniform electric field distribution in the Zn@CM than the zinc foil due to the aligned platelet morphology. Furthermore, the significant improvement is also achieved in a Zn||MnO2 full battery with a high capacity-retention (87% vs 47.8%). This study demonstrates that controlled-current electrodeposition represents an important strategy to regulate the crystal plane orientation and the morphology of the pre-deposited zinc layer, hence leading to the highly reversible and dendrite-free zinc anode for high-performance zinc ion batteries.

MethodsWe surveyed 120 patients with breast or gynecological cancer at the end of acute cancer treatment, either directly after surgery or during adjuvant chemotherapy. We assessed challenges, subjective competencies, and SCN using a self-developed measure comprising 25 items referring to coping tasks assigned to six domains. In addition, patients' competencies and health literacy (HL) were assessed. ResultsMost patients felt at least moderately challenged by coping tasks concerning psychological distress (e.g., dealing with fears and insecurities, 70.2%; coping with cancer diagnosis, 69.6%) and physical complaints (e.g., dealing with a reduced physical capacity, 56.6%). About 42.5%-71.4% of patients who evaluated coping tasks as highly challenging felt competent to deal with these challenges themselves. Less than half of patients reported SCN, mainly regarding psychological concerns. The extent of challenging coping tasks, patients' perceived ability to overcome challenges themselves, and SCN showed associations to patient competencies and HL. ConclusionsSCN regarding psychological concerns and health behavior should be addressed in acute cancer care and rehabilitation programs. In addition, promoting HL might be essential in strengthening patients' subjective competencies related to various coping tasks.

In this research, an unprecedented type of reconfigurable acoustic metascreen is proposed for broadband manipulations of transmitted acoustic waves. The conceived structure is composed of uniquely designed unit cells producing the modulation of the transmitted phase shift within the full 2 pi range with an excellent impedance matching with the background medium. By rationally arranging the reconfigurable elements within the metascreen based on the corresponding parameter profile, different phenomena and functionalities can be easily realized. As examples, acoustic focusing and acoustic bending are presented to showcase the performance of the proposed metascreen. We indeed numerically and experimentally demonstrate the ultra-broadband and reconfigurable features of our concept over an astonishing frequency range extending from 3 to 17 kHz, which covers the majority spectrum of the audible range of human hearing. Our work provides a unique and remarkable conceptual design of acoustic metascreen opening a promising and pragmatic route to conceive compact broadband acoustic devices, where wavefront manipulations on broadband sound signals or pulsed signals are required.

Integrating this new type of metasurface with the standard vertical cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) platform enables an ultracompact and powerful solution to control both phase and polarization properties of the laser on a chip, which allows to structure a VCSEL into vector beams with on-demand wavefronts. Here, this concept is demonstrated by directly generating versatile vector beams from commercially available VCSELs through on-chip integration of high-index dielectric metasurfaces. Experimentally, the versatility of the approach for the development of vectorial VCSELs are validated by implementing a variety of functionalities, including directional emission of multibeam with specified polarizations, vectorial holographic display, and vector vortex beams generations. Notably, the proposed vectorial VCSELs integrated with a single layer of beam shaping metasurface bypass the requirements of multiple cascaded optical components, and thus have the potential to promote the advancements of ultracompact, lightweight, and scalable vector beams sources, enriching and expanding the applications of VCSELs in optical communications, laser manipulation and processing, information encryption, and quantum optics.

The effect of gender on physical condition was also evaluated separately for each group. MethodSixty individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disability, 30 living in RH and 30 living in IH, participated in this study. The RH and IH groups were homogeneous in terms of gender distribution (17 males and 13 females) and intellectual disability level. Body composition, postural balance, and static and dynamic force were considered as dependent variables. ResultsThe IH group performed better in the postural balance and dynamic force tests compared to the RH group, but no significant differences between the groups were observed for any body composition or static force variable. Women in both groups tended to have better postural balance than men, while men presented higher dynamic force. ConclusionsThe IH group presented a higher physical fitness compared to RH group. This result emphasises the need to increase the frequency and intensity of the physical activity sessions commonly programed for individuals living in RH.

MethodsA self-reported online survey of 1474 registered dental practitioners in Australia was conducted from October to December 2021. Participants reported thoughts of suicide in the preceding 12 months, prior to the preceding 12 months and prior suicide attempts. ResultsOverall, 17.6% reported thoughts of suicide in the preceding 12 months, 31.4% prior to the preceding 12 months, and 5.6% reported ever having made a suicide attempt. In multivariate models, the odds of suicidal ideation in the preceding 12 months were higher in dental practitioners who were male (OR = 2.01), had a current diagnosis of depression (OR = 1.62), were experiencing moderate (OR = 2.76) or severe psychological distress (OR = 3.58), had self-reported illicit substance use (OR = 2.06) or had previous self-reported suicide attempts (OR = 3.02). Younger dental practitioners had more than twice the odds of recent suicidal ideation than those aged 61+ years, with higher resilience having decreasing odds of suicidal ideation. LimitationsThis study did not address help seeking behaviours directly related to suicidal ideation, so it is not clear how many participants were actively seeking mental health support. The response rate was low and results may be subject to responder biases, with practitioners experiencing depression, stress and burnout being more willing to participate. ConclusionThese finding highlight a high prevalence of suicidal ideation amongst Australian dental practitioners. It is important to continue to monitor their mental health and develop tailored programs to provide essential interventions and supports.

In this context, transition metal selenides (TMSes) are found to be feasible, ecofriendly, and effective electrocatalysts with futuristic characteristics. A deep and comprehensive investigation on metal selenides for energy conversion and storage application is summarized in this review article. Different methods such as hydrothermal, solvothermal, coprecipitation, hot injection, successive ionic layer adsorption reaction, polyol, and others can be used for the synthesis of metal selenides based electrocatalysts, with different morphologies and compositions. The morphology of metal selenides is strongly controlled by factors such as reaction time, temperature, pH of the reaction medium, and surfactant. The electrochemical applications of metal selenides are governed by morphology, active spots for reaction, surface engineering, and confinement. It is concluded that TMSes deliver high performance with large surface area, which is possible due to their porous or 3D morphology. The TMSes with multimetal or with doping metal/nonmetals perform better compared to single atoms.

DC magnetometry results have been evaluated by means of a phenomenological Hamiltonian approach regarding zero field splitting (ZFS) parameters and compared with results from ab-initio multi-reference CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent field) calculations and qualitative ligand field theory (AILFT). Profound investigation of spin-lattice relaxation with the variation of temperature (from 1.8 to about 8 K) and magnetic field (at 14 different fields from zero up to 1 T) have been performed based on AC magnetometry. Under an applied dc magnetic field, spin-lattice relaxation occurs via a direct process with T-2 temperature dependence due to limited heat transfer at very low temperature and above 5 K relaxation by an Orbach process with an energy barrier of Ueff ${{U}_{{\rm e}{\rm f}{\rm f}}}$ approximate to 80 K dominates.

The novel delaminated V-MXene (DM-V2CTx) engineered ruthenium-ALD (Ru-ALD) temperature sensor demonstrates a competitive sensing performance of 1.11% degrees C-1 as of only V-MXene of 0.42% degrees C-1. A nearly threefold increase in sensing and reversibility performance linked to the highly ordered few-layered V-MXene and selective, well-controlled Ru atomic doping by ALD for the successful formation of Ru@DM-V2CTX heterostructure. The advanced heterostructure formation, the mechanism, and the role of Ru have been comprehensively investigated by ultra-high-resolution transmission/scanning transmission electron microscopies coupled with next-generation spherical aberration correction technology and fast, accurate elemental mapping quantifications, also by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. To the knowledge, this work is the first to use the novel, optimally processed V-MXene over conventionally used Ti-MXene and its surface-internal structure engineering by Ru-ALD process-based temperature-sensing devices function and operational demonstrations. The current work could potentially motivate the development of multifunctional, future, next-generation, safe, personal healthcare electronic devices by the industrially scalable ALD technique.

Mixed model analysis was used.Results: GP versus G markedly reduced the increase in blood glucose concentrations (P < .001) and had a synergistic effect on the increase in insulin concentrations (P < .001), in men both with and without T2D. Glucose concentrations were higher in men with T2D compared with those without T2D, whereas insulin and glucagon concentrations were largely unaffected by the presence of T2D. Gastric emptying was faster in men with T2D than in those without T2D.Conclusions: The ability of whey protein to reduce carbohydrate-induced, postprandial hyperglycaemia is retained in older men with T2D compared with those without T2D, and whey protein supplementation may be a useful strategy in the prevention and management of T2D in older people.

Synthesized Au@OMC was characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, DLS, and BET analysis, revealing the successful immobilization of Au nanoparticles on the surface of OMC material. Au@OMC exhibited high catalytic activity for three-component A3 coupling reaction between aldehydes, amines, and phenylacetylene to furnish propargyl amines. Also, KA2 coupling reaction between ketones, amines, and phenylacetylene was efficiently performed using Au@OMC catalytic system. Recyclability studies indicated that the recovered catalyst can be reused for five runs without considerable changes in the catalytic activity. The leaching experiment revealed that there is no Au catalyst leaching into the reaction solution.

This work examines the quantum paraelectric state, an elusive state of matter characterized by the smooth saturation of the ferroelectric instability at low temperature due to quantum fluctuations associated with anharmonic phonon effects. The temperature-dependent evolution of the soft ferroelectric phonon mode in the quantum paraelectric KTaO3 in the range 0-300 K is modeled by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by an on-the-fly machine-learned force field. The calculated data show that including anharmonic terms is essential to stabilize the spurious imaginary ferroelectric phonon predicted by DFT in the harmonic approximation, in agreement with experiments. Augmenting the DFT workflow with machine-learned force fields allows for efficient stochastic sampling of the configuration space using large supercells in a wide temperature range, inaccessible to conventional ab initio protocols. This work proposes a robust computational workflow capable of accounting for collective behaviors involving different degrees of freedom and occurring at large time/length scales, paving the way for precise modeling and control of quantum effects in materials.

Benefiting from the large cavity of CB[8] and its strong binding affinity with positively charged tetraphenylethylene pyridinium (TPE-Py), a 1:2 stoichiometric supramolecular assembly is formed through host-guest interactions with binding constants of 2.95 x 10(11) M-2 and fluorescence bathochromic shift about 35 nm due to the macrocyclic confinement effect, thereby endowing the fluorescence enhancement about 20 times when further assembled with negatively charged SBE-beta CD to form nanosheets through electrostatic interactions. In contrast, the direct assembly of TPE-Py and SBE-beta CD can form nanoparticles through electrostatic interactions, showing only tenfold enhancement and no bathochromic shift due to the lack of macrocyclic confinement effect. After doping the near-infrared dye acceptor sulfonated aluminum phthalocyanine (AlPcS4), the nanosheets structure exhibits a higher energy transfer efficiency of about 75% and a larger antenna effect of 29.3 than that of nanoparticles. The multilevel supramolecular assemblies can be used in multicolor luminescence information storage and multiple logical gate systems, providing an efficient approach for configurationally confined topological morphology regulation and luminescent materials.

A general expression for the statistical error in a diffusion coefficient obtained from a solid-state molecular-dynamics simulation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						diffusion; kinetic Monte Carlo; kMC; mean squared displacement; MSD; molecular dynamics; MD; statistical error	REACTIVE FORCE-FIELD; OXYGEN DIFFUSION; LATERAL DIFFUSION; ION-TRANSPORT; YTTRIA; OXIDES; ARCHIPELAGO; CONDUCTOR; DISORDER; PARTICLE	Analysis of the mean squared displacement of species k, (r(2) (k)), as a function of simulation time t constitutes a powerful method for extracting, from a molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation, the tracer diffusion coefficient, D-* k. The statistical error in D* (k) is seldom considered, and when it is done, the error is generally underestimated. In this study, we examined the statistics of (r(2) (k))(t) curves generated by solid-state diffusion by means of kinetic Monte Carlo sampling. Our results indicate that the statistical error in D-* k depends, in a strongly interrelated way, on the simulation time, the cell size, and the number of relevant point defects in the simulation cell. Reducing our results to one key quantity-the number of k particles that have jumped at least once-we derive a closed-form expression for the relative uncertainty in D-* k. We confirm the accuracy of our expression through comparisons with self-generated MD diffusion data. With the expression, we formulate a set of simple rules that encourage the efficient use of computational resources for MD simulations.

METHODSWe profiled genome-wide methylomic variations in the parahippocampal gyrus from 201 post mortem control, mild cognitive impaired, and AD brains. RESULTSWe identified 270 distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with AD. We quantified the impact of these DMRs on each gene and each protein as well as gene and protein co-expression networks. DNA methylation had a profound impact on both AD-associated gene/protein modules and their key regulators. We further integrated the matched multi-omics data to show the impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility, which further modulates gene and protein expression. DISCUSSIONThe quantified impact of DNA methylation on gene and protein networks underlying AD identified potential upstream epigenetic regulators of AD. HighlightsA cohort of DNA methylation data in the parahippocampal gyrus was developed from 201 post mortem control, mild cognitive impaired, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains.Two hundred seventy distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found to be associated with AD compared to normal control.A metric was developed to quantify methylation impact on each gene and each protein.DNA methylation was found to have a profound impact on not only the AD-associated gene modules but also key regulators of the gene and protein networks.Key findings were validated in an independent multi-omics cohort in AD.The impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility was also investigated by integrating the matched methylomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data.

However, the linkages between cooperative membership and labor allocation remain unexplored. To fill this gap, we examine the impact of cooperative membership on off-farm work decisions of couples engaged in farming, using data collected from 595 banana farmers in China. The recursive bivariate probit model and endogenous-treatment Poisson regression model are employed to address the self-selection bias inherent in cooperative membership. The results show that cooperative membership increases the probability of participating in off-farm work by 38% for husbands and 31% for wives. Having large households reduces the probability of husbands but increases that of wives working off-farm. Cooperative membership is also associated with more time spent on off-farm work and higher earnings for both husbands and wives. Our findings point to the potential of agricultural cooperatives to increase farm couples' off-farm employment, thus increasing household income and quality of life.

Epigenetic effects of folate and related B vitamins on brain health throughout life: Scientific substantiation and translation of the evidence for health improvement strategies	NUTRITION BULLETIN			English	Article						ageing; B vitamins; cognition; DNA methylation; folate; one-carbon metabolism	FOLIC-ACID SUPPLEMENTATION; NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS; DNA METHYLATION; EARLY-PREGNANCY; NUTRITION; PREVENTION; TRIAL; BIRTH; 2ND	Suboptimal status of folate and/or interrelated B vitamins (B-12, B-6 and riboflavin) can perturb one-carbon metabolism and adversely affect brain development in early life and brain function in later life. Human studies show that maternal folate status during pregnancy is associated with cognitive development in the child, whilst optimal B vitamin status may help to prevent cognitive dysfunction in later life. The biological mechanisms explaining these relationships are not clear but may involve folate-related DNA methylation of epigenetically controlled genes related to brain development and function. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking these B vitamins and the epigenome with brain health at critical stages of the lifecycle is necessary to support evidence-based health improvement strategies. The EpiBrain project, a transnational collaboration involving partners in the United Kingdom, Canada and Spain, is investigating the nutrition-epigenome-brain relationship, particularly focussing on folate-related epigenetic effects in relation to brain health outcomes. We are conducting new epigenetics analysis on bio-banked samples from existing well-characterised cohorts and randomised trials conducted in pregnancy and later life. Dietary, nutrient biomarker and epigenetic data will be linked with brain outcomes in children and older adults. In addition, we will investigate the nutrition-epigenome-brain relationship in B vitamin intervention trial participants using magnetoencephalography, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging modality to assess neuronal functioning. The project outcomes will provide an improved understanding of the role of folate and related B vitamins in brain health, and the epigenetic mechanisms involved. The results are expected to provide scientific substantiation to support nutritional strategies for better brain health across the lifecycle.

Porous honeycomb film membranes enhance endothelial barrier integrity in human vascular wall bilayer model compared to standard track-etched membranes	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A			English	Article						adherens junctions; endothelial barrier integrity; gap junctions; human vascular wall bilayer; porous membrane; tight junctions	INTERNAL ELASTIC LAMINA; JUNCTION PROTEINS; GAP-JUNCTIONS; COCULTURE; SUBSTRATE; TISSUE; CELLS; INFLAMMATION; HOMEOSTASIS; ARTERIOLES	In vitro vascular wall bilayer models for drug testing and disease modeling must emulate the physical and biological properties of healthy vascular tissue and its endothelial barrier function. Both endothelial cell (EC)-vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) interaction across the internal elastic lamina (IEL) and blood vessel stiffness impact endothelial barrier integrity. Polymeric porous track-etched membranes (TEM) typically represent the IEL in laboratory vascular bilayer models. However, TEM stiffness exceeds that of diseased blood vessels, and the membrane pore architecture limits EC-SMC interaction. The mechanical properties of compliant honeycomb film (HCF) membranes better simulate the Young's modulus of healthy blood vessels, and HCFs are thinner (4 vs. 10 mu m) and more porous (57 vs. 6.5%) than TEMs. We compared endothelial barrier integrity in vascular wall bilayer models with human ECs and SMCs statically cultured on opposite sides of HCFs and TEMs (5 mu m pores) for up to 12 days. Highly segregated localization of tight junction (ZO-1) and adherens junction (VE-cadherin) proteins and quiescent F-actin cytoskeletons demonstrated superior and earlier maturation of interendothelial junctions. Quantifying barrier integrity based on transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), membranes showed only minor but significant TEER differences despite enhanced junctional protein localization on HCF. Elongated ECs on HCF likely experienced greater paracellular diffusion than blocky ECs on TEM. Also, larger populations of plaques of connexin 43 subunit-containing gap junctions suggested enhanced EC-SMC communication across the more porous, thinner HCF. Compared with standard TEMs, engineered vascular wall bilayers cultured on HCFs better replicate physiologic endothelial barrier integrity.

Peptide-based formula: Clinical applications and benefits	NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Review						enteral nutrition; formulas; nutrition support; peptides; tube feeding	ENTERAL NUTRITION; PARENTERAL-NUTRITION; SEMIELEMENTAL FORMULA; POLYMERIC FORMULA; FEEDING INTOLERANCE; PREVALENCE; SUPPORT; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; TOLERANCE	The use of enteral nutrition (EN) continues to increase given benefits. However, with this increase in use, it is also becoming evident that enteral feeding intolerance (EFI) is also quite prevalent, leading to the inability to meet nutrition needs in many patients. Given the wide variability in the EN population as well as the number of formulas available, there is not a clear consensus regarding the best approach to EFI management. One approach that is emerging to improve EN tolerance is the use of peptide-based formulas (PBFs). PBFs refer to enteral formulas containing proteins that have been enzymatically hydrolyzed to dipeptides and tripeptides. These hydrolyzed proteins are often combined with higher medium-chain triglyceride content to generate an enteral formula that is essentially easier to absorb and utilize. Emerging data demonstrate that the use of PBF in patients with EFI may improve clinical outcomes along with a corresponding reduction in healthcare utilization and potentially the cost of care. This review aims to navigate through key clinical applications and benefits of PBF and to discuss relevant data shared in the literature.

A scoping review was conducted to determine what is known about possible clinical experience performance predictors and to find associated research gaps. MethodsThe search included one hand-searched journal and seven databases, which were used to identify related relevant studies: CINAHL, Education Database, Education Source, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PubMed, REHABDATA, and Web of Science. A research librarian guided the search process, and the review's reporting is structured by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist. Studies were included if they contained predictors of clinical experience success indicated by validated performance evaluation tools that were scored by clinical instructors. A multidisciplinary team reviewed the title, abstract, and full text for inclusion and conducted thematic data synthesis to categorise findings. FindingsTwenty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. The majority of articles were of correlational design and included single institutions. Seventeen articles included occupational therapy, eight included physical therapy, with only one article including both programmes. Four categories of predictors of clinical experience success were identified: pre-admission variables, academic preparation, learner characteristics, and demographics. Each of the main categories included three to six subcategories. Key findings included the following: (a) The most common cited predictors in clinical experiences are academic preparation and learner characteristics, (b) more experimental design studies are needed to determine the causal relationship between predictors and clinical experience success, and (c) future research is needed on ethnic disparities and clinical experience success. ConclusionFindings from this review show that possible predictors of clinical experience success include a wide range of factors when correlating success with a standardised tool. Academic preparation and learner characteristics were the most investigated predictors. There were only a small number of studies that found a correlation with pre-admission variables. The findings of this study suggest that students' academic achievement may be a critical element of clinical experience preparation. Future research using experimental designs and across institutions is needed to determine the main predictors for student success.	[Horwitz, Heidi M. M.; Struckmeyer, Linda R.

Morphology of the MWCNTs/PLA/PBS masterbatch prepared by Pickering emulsion method was confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation. Comprehensive effects of different content of masterbatch and UV aging time on the morphology, crystallization, and electrical and electromagnetic shielding properties of MWCNTs/PLA/PBS composites were shown by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), SEM, wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), polarizing microscope (POM), ultra-depth of field optical microscope, resistance tester, and vector network analyzer. Compared with PBS composite with 0.1 wt% MWCNTs, the electrical conductivity of PBS composite with the MWCNTs/PLA/PBS masterbatch increased by two orders of magnitude, and dispersed morphology for the composite showed double percolation structure. After UV aging, both MWCNTs/PBS composites and the PBS composites with the MWCNTs/PLA/PBS masterbatch, their surface presented burnt yellow and parts of flaws, while both their electrical conductivity and total electromagnetic shielding effectiveness gradually increased. Moreover, with the increasing of UV aging time, not only crystal size of these PBS-based composites became large, but also their crystal interface became clearer. Furthermore, when UV aging time reached 528 h, the tensile strength of 0.6 M/PLA/PBS composite decreased by 12.6%, while its total electromagnetic shielding effectiveness increased by 39.8%, compared with the composite without UV aging.

This article studies efficient implementations of double-array Aho-Corasick automata (DAACs), data structures for quickly performing the multiple pattern matching. The practical performance of DAACs is improved by carefully designing the data structure, and many implementation techniques have been proposed thus far. A problem in DAACs is that comprehensive descriptions and experimental analyses on their ideas are not provided. Engineers face difficulties in implementing an efficient DAAC. In this article, we review implementation techniques for DAACs and provide a comprehensive description of them. We also propose several new techniques for further improvement. We conduct exhaustive experiments through real-world datasets and reveal the best combination of techniques to achieve a higher performance in DAACs. The best combination is different from those used in the most popular libraries of DAACs, which demonstrates that their performance can be further enhanced. On the basis of our experimental analysis, we developed a new Rust library for fast multiple pattern matching using DAACs, named Daachorse, as open-source software at . Experiments demonstrate that Daachorse outperforms other AC-automaton implementations, indicating its suitability as a fast alternative for multiple pattern matching in many applications.

It is shown that biaxial stretching promotes the homogeneous distribution and alignment of CNTs in the stretching plane, improving the sensing performance of the strain sensors. The optimized stretching ratios (SRs) of CNT/PDMS nanocomposites are determined. Compared to an unstretched CNT/PDMS-1.0 sensor (gauge factor [GF] value = 0.73, detectable range from 0 to 60%), the 1.5 wt% CNT/PDMS-1.5 sensor (SR = 1.5) exhibits enhanced strain sensitivity (GF = 2.8), a wider detectable range (0-370%) and better performance stability. The GF values of CNT/PDMS-2.0 and CNT/PDMS-2.5 sensors with SRs of 2.0 and 2.5, respectively, were 1.18 and 1.06, respectively, due to more significant conductive network reconstruction in the process of applying strain, leading to a decreasing GF. The possibility of sensors in the application of wearable electronic components is also demonstrated. The sensor shows a clear and stable signal output when different strain modes are applied, such as tensile, compressive, bending, and twisting.

J	Lou, YF; Zheng, HL; Yang, J				Lou, Yifan; Zheng, Huiling; Yang, Jun			Optimal design of reliability acceptance sampling plan based on constant-stress accelerated life testing considering the uncertainty of accelerated factor	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						accelerated acceptance sampling plan; constant-stress accelerated life testing; lognormal distribution; reliability demonstration; the uncertainty of accelerated factor	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; WEIBULL DISTRIBUTION; TIME	With the increasing marketplace demand for decreasing test time and cost, constant-stress accelerated life testing (CSALT) is widely used for reliability demonstration in practice. The existing accelerated acceptance sampling plans (AASPs) do not consider the uncertainty of accelerated factor (AF), which makes it difficult to accurately describe the producer's and consumer's risks. Previous AASP studies on CSALT were mainly carried out under a fixed accelerated stress level, and the influence of accelerated stress level is not concerned. Therefore, considering the uncertainty of AF and taking the lognormal distribution as an example, the AASP design method with time-censoring is proposed, where the life-stress relationship between the location parameter and stress level is expressed by an inverse power law model. First, considering the uncertainty of AF expressed by a distribution, the acceptance probability can be obtained by the mathematic expectation of conditional acceptance probability, and the producer's and consumer's risks can be accurately expressed. Then, to reduce the total cost furtherly, the accelerated stress level is considered as a new decision variable, the optimum AASP including the sampling plan and the decision-making criterion can be designed by minimizing the total cost and solving the risk constraint equations of both sides. A real case study of white organic light-emitting diodes is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Based on the 2015 case studies of five textile and garment firms in Ethiopia, they find that employment security and physical well-being were driven mainly by government labour regulations negotiated by local employers, workers and trade unions rather than by global buyers and conclude that upgrading and downgrading can occur simultaneously within a firm.

Mesenchymal Stem Cells Sense the Toughness of Nanomaterials and Interfaces	ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS			English	Article						2D nanomaterials; liquid-liquid interface; protein nanosheet; self-assembly; stem cells; toughness	FOCAL ADHESIONS; MECHANISMS; RHEOLOGY; DIFFERENTIATION; VISCOELASTICITY; DEFORMATION; SURFACTANTS; MOLECULES; STIFFNESS; STRENGTH	Stem cells are known to sense and respond to the mechanical properties of biomaterials. In turn, cells exert forces on their environment that can lead to striking changes in shape, size and contraction of associated tissues, and may result in mechanical disruption and functional failure. However, no study has so far correlated stem cell phenotype and biomaterials toughness. Indeed, disentangling toughness-mediated cell response from other mechanosensing processes has remained elusive as it is particularly challenging to uncouple Youngs' or shear moduli from toughness, within a range relevant to cell-generated forces. In this report, it is shown how the design of the macromolecular architecture of polymer nanosheets regulates interfacial toughness, independently of interfacial shear storage modulus, and how this controls the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells at liquid interfaces. The viscoelasticity and toughness of poly(l-lysine) nanosheets assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces is characterised via interfacial shear rheology. The local (microscale) mechanics of nanosheets are characterised via magnetic tweezer-assisted interfacial microrheology and the thickness of these assemblies is determined from in situ ellipsometry. Finally, the response of mesenchymal stem cells to adhesion and culture at corresponding interfaces is investigated via immunostaining and confocal microscopy.

Pseudo-labeling is a classical SSL method that uses a model to predict unlabeled samples and selects the prediction with the highest confidence level as the pseudo-labels and then uses the generated pseudo-labels to train the model. Most of the current pseudo-label-based SSL algorithms use predefined fixed thresholds for all classes to select unlabeled data. PurposeHowever, data imbalance is a common problem in medical image tasks, where the use of fixed threshold to generate pseudo-labels ignores different classes of learning status and learning difficulties. The aim of this study is to develop an algorithm to solve this problem. MethodsIn this work, we propose Multi-Curriculum Pseudo-Labeling (MCPL), which evaluates the learning status of the model for each class at each epoch and automatically adjusts the thresholds for each class. We apply MCPL to FixMatch and propose a new SSL framework for medical image classification, which we call the improved algorithm FaxMatch. To mitigate the impact of incorrect pseudo-labels on the model, we use label smoothing (LS) strategy to generate soft labels (SL) for pseudo-labels. ResultsWe have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on two public benchmark medical image classification datasets: the ISIC 2018 skin lesion analysis and COVID-CT datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms fully supervised baseline, which uses only labeled data to train the model. Moreover, our method also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. ConclusionsWe propose MCPL and construct a semi-supervised medical image classification framework to reduce the reliance of the model on a large number of labeled images and reduce the manual workload of labeling medical image data.

Growing evidence indicates that edible fungus is rich in various active ingredients including polysaccharides, proteins, fats, vitamins, and other ingredients. Polysaccharides are one of the main active ingredients of edible fungi. Increasing research has confirmed that edible fungus polysaccharides (EFPs) show multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, immune regulation, anti-virus, gut microbiota regulation, hypoglycemic, etc. Hence, EFP related research has received more and more attention due to their non-toxic, high medical, and nutritional values. This paper reviews the latest research progress of EFPs biological activities, and looks forward to their future development trend. This review provides a theoretical basis for studying the application of EFPs in the fields of biomedicine, cosmetics, health food, and promotes the development and utilization of EFPs.

Although applications retaining the integrity of the mechanical bond are usually reported, the dethreading of the components can be crucial to develop some advanced applications. Thus, different dethreading strategies have been reported, and advanced applications which require such a process have turned out to be suitable approaches towards machine-like operation. This review article covers recent examples of applications of pseudorotaxanes and rotaxanes in which dethreading processes have a key role to accomplish the desired function.

Interaction alerts: A comparison of classifications and recommendations for clinical management between <i>J</i>anusmed and three other knowledge resources	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						classification; clinical management; clinically significant; drug interaction alerts; interaction knowledge resources	DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS; CARE; PREVALENCE; SFINX	Classifications of drug interaction alerts differ between knowledge resources, but agreement regarding recommendations for clinical management is less explored. Starting from the medication lists of 274 older patients with >= 2 drugs, all unique drug pairs that triggered a clinically significant interaction alert in Janusmed were included: 100 Category C (manageable by, e.g. dose adjustment) and nine Category D interactions (should be avoided). Out of 109 C/D alerts in Janusmed, 89 (82%), 75 (69%) and 45 (41%) drug pairs triggered an alert of similar clinical significance in Lexicomp, Micromedex (R) and Stockley's Drug Interactions/Checker (Stockley), respectively. Eight (7%), 20 (18%) and 10 (9%) drug pairs did not trigger any alert in these resources. For 81 (74%), 81 (74%) and 94 (86%) drug pairs, Lexicomp, Micromedex and Stockley provided at least one recommendation for clinical management similar to those provided by Janusmed. For 16 (15%), 9 (8%) and 21 (19%) drug pairs, these resources provided recommendation(s) entirely in agreement with Janusmed. Although many drug pairs elicit alerts of similar significance, and partly concordant recommendations, a non-negligible proportion do not. The findings encourage medical/pharmaceutical reflection by prescribing clinicians and dispensing pharmacists; recommendations provided by knowledge resources vary considerably and cannot be considered definite.

However, it is still a challenge to develop hydrogels with excellent multiple responsiveness for smart wearable sensors. In this paper, a facile synthesis of carbon quantum dots (CQDs)-doped cross-linked chitosan quaternary/carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels (CCCDs) is presented. Designing of dual network hydrogels decorated with CQDs provides abundant crosslinking and improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogels. The hydrogel-based strain sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (gauge factor: 9.88), linearity (R-2: 0.97), stretchable ability (stress: 0.67 MPa; strain: 404%), good cyclicity, and durability. The luminescent properties are endowed by the CQDs further broaden the application of hydrogels for realizing flexible electronics. More interestingly, the strain sensor based on CCCDs hydrogel demonstrates photo responsiveness (Delta R/R-0 approximate to 20%) and pH responsiveness (pH range approximate to 4-7) performance. CCCDs hydrogels can be used for gesture recognition and light sensing switch. As a proof-of-concept, a smart wearable sensor is designed for monitoring human activities and detecting pH variation in human sweat during exercise. This study reveals new possibilities for further applications in wearable health monitoring.

By analysing historical outbreak and bilateral FDI data from 2001 to 2012, we find FDI inflows during an outbreak are 21.5% below the pre-outbreak average and 21.6% above the pre-outbreak average FDI inflows in the 3 years after the end of an outbreak, which highlights the compensatory FDI after the end of epidemic and implies the uncertainty mechanism. We confirm the validity of the uncertainty mechanism, which converts the health shock into risk factors in the real economy, by studying the industry-level heterogeneity and showing that the M&A in industries with lower redeployability is more sensitive to epidemic outbreaks. Finally, we explore country-level heterogeneity that may influence the relationship between epidemic outbreaks and FDI inflows. We find that countries with poor medical conditions suffer greater decreases in FDI inflows during outbreaks, and countries with poorer institutional quality do not experience compensatory FDI after an outbreak ends.

Various dynamic covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions have been employed to design multifunctional polymers with recyclability, reprocessablility, and sustainability. Among them, polymers based on reversible boron-oxygen (B-O) bonds have been widely investigated because of their unique properties. Particularly, lots of scientists have demonstrated that the combination with boron-nitrogen (B-N) coordination can effectively accelerate the dynamicity as well as enhance the stability of B-O bonds. Therefore, numerous polymers containing dynamic B-O bonds with dative B-N coordination have been designed and synthesized in recent years. These polymers exhibit excellent versatility and great potential for diverse applications such as biosensors, battery electrolytes, and artificial skins. This review provides an overview of the comprehensive influence of dynamic B-N coordination chemistry on B-O bonds in organoboron species and highlights the developments in the area of constructing boron-containing polymeric materials with this interesting linkage. The design guidelines, existing challenges, and future perspectives in this burgeoning field are discussed and proposed.

Pre-registered protocol: osf.io/aywg2.Design: Prospective cohort study.Setting: Based on entire overlap between the Vasaloppet registry and the population-based Swedish Pregnancy Register.Sample: All female Vasaloppet participants 1991-2017 with subsequent singleton delivery (skiers), and age- and county-matched non-skiers.Methods: We calculated odds ratios (ORs) for non-skiers versus skiers (model 1) and, among skiers, by performance (model 2), in Bayesian logistic regressions adjusted for socio-demographics, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities. We repeated calculations adjusting for early pregnancy body mass index (potential mediator) and explored robustness (selection/exposure settings; multiple comparisons correction).Main outcome measures: Twenty-nine important perinatal outcomes, predefined based on existing expert consensus.Results: Non-skiers (n = 194 384) versus skiers (n = 15 377) (and slower versus faster performance, not shown) consistently had higher odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR 1.70, 95% highest density interval: 1.40-2.09), excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) (1.28, 1.22-1.38), psychiatric morbidity (1.60, 1.49-1.72), any caesarean section (CS) (1.34, 1.28-1.40), elective CS (1.39, 1.29-1.49), and large-for-gestational-age babies (> 90th percentile, 1.11, 1.04-1.18); lower odds of inadequate GWG (0.83, 0.79-0.88); and no associations with fetal/neonatal complications (e.g. preterm birth [1.09, 0.98-1.20], small for gestational age [SGA] [1.23, 1.05-1.45]). Adjustment for body mass index attenuated associations with excessive (1.20, 1.14-1.30) and inadequate GWG (0.87, 0.83-0.92) and large for gestational age (1.07, 1.00-1.13).Conclusion: Non-skiers compared with skiers, and slower versus faster performance, consistently displayed higher odds of GDM, excessive GWG, psychiatric morbidity, CS and large-for-gestational-age babies; and lower odds of inadequate GWG, after adjustment for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and comorbidities. There were no associations with fetal/neonatal complications.

Economic, social, and environmental factors all play a role in the CE. Also, logistics activities are critical parts of the CE. Hence, this study's goal is to create a framework for evaluating organizations' CE logistics performance. The main contribution of the study is the creation of a framework to assess the circularity performance, including various logistics activities, and measure the performance of logistics activities. To establish a list of criteria, 30 experts were interviewed. The criteria were ranked using fuzzy statements.

The few reported dynamic reconfigurable synapses based on ambipolar transistors switch the operating states by voltages with opposite polarity, which impedes the development of highly efficient synaptic readout circuits. To improve the efficiency, flexibility, and biocompatibility of dynamic reconfigurable synapses, here a ferroelectrics-electret synergetic organic synaptic p-type transistor (FESOST) is devised. Owing to the synergetic action of ferroelectric polarization switching and charge capture, FESOST exhibits single-polarity driven dynamic reconfigurable operating states with different synaptic behaviors (potentiation and depression) in response to the same gate pulse in different modes (excitatory and inhibitory). In addition, various single-polarity driven synaptic behaviors including short-term/long-term plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and spike-number-dependent plasticity are also simulated. Finally, the reconfigurable artificial temperature perception system is simulated for the complex emotions of humans in response to different weather stimuli for people of different constitutions. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of dynamic, reconfigurable, high-efficiency, organic synapses.

J	Carey, M; Boland, J; Keppel, G				Carey, Mark; Boland, John; Keppel, Gunnar			Habitat diversity, resource availability and island age in the species-area relationship	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						choros model; environmental heterogeneity; general dynamic model; island biogeography; resource availability; species-area relationships; species-area-energy models	EQUILIBRIUM-THEORY; ENERGY; RICHNESS; HETEROGENEITY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ATTRIBUTES; PATTERNS; BIOLOGY; MODEL; WATER	Aim: The island species-area relationship (ISAR) assumes that the area of islands is homogeneous, or scales with environmental heterogeneity across an archipelago, which is not always the case. We compare the performance of models that adjust or substitute for island area with measures of habitat diversity, island age and resource availability for two taxonomic groups.Location: Five hotspot archipelagos (Azores, Galapagos, Hawaii, Cape Verde, Canary Islands).Taxa: Vascular plants, birds.Methods: We used the mathematical framework of the power law to compare relevant models, treating the one containing only area as a null model against which others were compared. Data were collated from databases and the literature. Models were compared using linear regression within archipelagos and via mixed effect models with archipelago as a random effect.Results: Weighting of island area by habitat diversity and resource availability systematically improved statistical significance and model fits versus the area only power law. Models including island age did not show the same systematic improvement in model fits. For vascular plants, weighting islands by resource availability (energy and water) performed better than weighting by habitat diversity, although for birds these weightings performed equally well.Main Conclusions: Given that islands within archipelagos are fairly heterogeneous in climate, topography and geology, it is worth accounting for this in ISARs. Our results suggest that, for islands in volcanic hotspot archipelagos, this is best done by using direct measures of habitat diversity and resource availability rather than using island age as a proxy. We, therefore, recommend using direct measures, rather than proxies, when investigating the drivers of biodiversity patterns on islands.

J	Diniz, E; Brandao, T; Veríssimo, M				Diniz, Eva; Brandao, Tania; Verissimo, Manuela			Father involvement during early childhood: A systematic review of qualitative studies	FAMILY RELATIONS			English	Review; Early Access						father involvement; fathering; psychosocial aspects; qualitative studies; systematic review	LOW-INCOME FATHERS; PATERNAL INVOLVEMENT; TRANSITION; FAMILIES	Objective: In this research, we analyze and integrate the qualitative empirical studies of father involvement, specifically examining his involvement in the multiple functions and dimensions of care during early childhood. Background: Father involvement is a relevant social and scientific topic given the changes in fathers' role in contemporary families. Fatherhood involving presence, affection, support, nurturance, as well as prioritizing child's needs, seems to be a perspective dominantly shared by parents. However, studies tend to focus on intact White middle-class families, neglecting other backgrounds and family configurations, which may be easily examined through qualitative approaches.Method: A database search was performed using a combination of relevant keywords in the title, abstract, and keywords.Results: Initially, 1,102 records were identified, with 58 manuscripts being assessed for eligibility. Finally, 16 articles were included. The analysis of the corpus identified three main themes: (a) the definition of father involvement and the description of main dimensions in which he was involved, (b) main challenges and facilitators of father involvement, and (c) the influence of intergenerational values on it.Conclusions: Findings provide insights about the multiple dimensions and roles related to father involvement, and they open new avenues for future research.Implications: The results reflected the state of the art about father involvement in qualitative research. Suggestions are made to reinforce fathers' full involvement in childcare, at personal and social levels.

Naringenin alleviate reproductive toxicity evoked by lead acetate via attenuation of sperm profile and biochemical alterations in male Wistar rat: Involvement of TGFβ/AKT/mTOR pathway	JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						AKT; mTOR; lead acetate; naringenin; sperm parameters; testicular toxicity	INDUCED TESTICULAR TOXICITY; GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; EXPOSURE; CURCUMIN; RELEASE; STRESS; DAMAGE; CELLS; MODEL; ACID	Exposure to Lead -causes testicular dysfunction through oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis; however, naringenin (NGN) therapeutic impact against lead-evoked testicular dysfunction remains elusive. Herein, the point of the study was to examine the defensive impact of NGN on testicular dysfunction initiated by lead. Seventy-Two male Wistar rats were allotted into nine groups; control group, drug control groups, lead acetate group, as well as NGN treated groups (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) respectively, given 5 days before lead acetate treatment. The result showed clearly the impact of lead on reduced sperm count, sperm motility as well as serum testosterone and LH levels. Additionally, it caused a significant rise in testicular inflammatory markers TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and TGF beta, effects that were accompanied by a reduction of AKT and mTOR levels. Lead acetate also caused degenerative changes in the testis, atrophy, and loss of spermatogenic series. Our findings revealed that NGN in a dose-dependent manner improved spermiotoxicity induced by lead acetate via restoration of the testicular function, preservation of spermatogenesis, halting inflammatory cytokines along with the enhancement of germ cell survival using upregulation of AKT/mTOR expressions. The present study discloses that NGN suppresses lead acetate toxicity that is involved in the antioxidant effect in a dose-dependent manner, besides its anti-inflammatory property.

Combining visual cues and pheromone blends for monitoring and management of the tarnished plant bug <i>Lygus lineolaris</i> (Hemiptera: Miridae)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Lygus lineolaris; pheromones; visual cues; sticky cards; hexyl butyrate; (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate; (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal	OLFACTORY FLORAL CUES; SEX-PHEROMONE; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; HOST PLANTS; COLOR TRAPS; HETEROPTERA; BEAUVOIS; ECOLOGY; PALISOT; HEIGHT	BACKGROUNDThe tarnished plant bug Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) is considered the most damaging pest of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in the mid-southern United States. Previous studies have reported the role of different ratios of volatile metathoracic gland components such as hexyl butyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate and (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal in eliciting low-level attraction of L. lineolaris. In this study, we tested different visual cues (colored sticky cards) in combination with olfactory cues (pheromone blends) to optimize the attraction and capture of L. lineolaris in the field. RESULTSRed-colored sticky cards were more attractive to L. lineolaris adults than white, blue or yellow cards. Red sticky cards combined with blends of three potential pheromone components attracted significantly more L. lineolaris adults than sticky cards without a blend added. Traps baited with a blend of hexyl butyrate, (E)-2-hexenyl butyrate and (E)-4-oxo-2-hexenal in 4:10:7 ratio, respectively, caught a significantly higher number of L. lineolaris than those baited with 10:4:2 or 7:10:4 blends or an unbaited control in the first week of the experiment. CONCLUSIONSCombining visual cues (red color) with olfactory cues (pheromone blends) significantly increased the capture of L. lineolaris in the field. This device or a future iteration could contribute towards sustainable and environmentally appropriate early-season monitoring and management of L. lineolaris in the field. (c) 2023 The Authors.

We used a set of submersible ultraviolet nitrate analyzers located at 13 stations across the ORB to examine nitrate loading and seasonality. Observed nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 2.8 mg L-1 N in the Ohio River's mainstem. The Ohio River experiences a greater than fivefold increase in annual nitrate load from the upper basin to the river's junction with the Mississippi River (74-415 Gg year(-1)). The nitrate load increase corresponds with the greater drainage area, a 50% increase in average annual nitrate concentration, and a shift in land cover across the drainage area from 5% cropland in the upper basin to 19% cropland at the Ohio River's junction with the Mississippi River. Time-series decomposition of nitrate concentration and nitrate load showed peaks centered in January and June for 85% of subbasin-year combinations and nitrate lows in summer and fall. Seasonal patterns of the terrestrial system, including winter dormancy, spring planting, and summer and fall growing-harvest seasons, are suggested to control nitrate timing in the Ohio River as opposed to controls by river discharge and internal cycling. The dormant season from December to March carries 51% of the ORB's nitrate load, and nitrate delivery is high across all subbasins analyzed, regardless of land cover. This season is characterized by soil nitrate leaching likely from mineralization of soil organic matter and release of legacy nitrogen. Nitrate experiences fast transit to the river owing to the ORB's mature karst geology in the south and tile drainage in the northwest. The planting season from April to June carries 26% of the ORB's nitrate and is a period of fertilizer delivery from upland corn and soybean agriculture to streams. The harvest season from July to November carries 22% of the ORB's nitrate and is a time of nitrate retention on the landscape. We discuss nutrient management in the ORB including fertilizer efficiency, cover crops, and nitrate retention using constructed measures.

Direct nose-to-brain drug delivery offers the possibility to treat central nervous system diseases more effectively, as it can evade the blood-brain barrier. In vitro and ex vivo intranasal models provide a means to investigate physiological and pharmaceutical factors that could play a role in drug delivery across the nasal epithelium as well as to determine the mechanisms involved in drug absorption from the nose. The development and implementation of cost-effective pharmacokinetic models for intranasal drug delivery with good in vitro-in vivo correlation can accelerate pharmaceutical drug product development and improve economic and ecological aspects by reducing the time and costs spent on animal studies. Special considerations should be made with regard to the purpose of the in vitro/ex vivo study, namely, whether it is intended to predict systemic or brain delivery, source and site of tissue or cell sampling, viability window of selected model, and the experimental setup of diffusion chambers. The type of model implemented should suit the relevant needs and requirements of the project, researcher, and interlaboratory. This review aims to provide an overview of in vitro and ex vivo models that have been developed to study intranasal and direct nose-to-brain drug delivery.

An adaptive observer based on lower triangular matrix transformation is proposed, which comprise the output derivatives information so as to enhance the accuracy and speed of fault estimation effectually. The designed observer can be simplified to the lower triangular estimation observer, and is superior to the comprehensive estimation observer in the related literature. In addition, a more general error dynamics is derived based on the improved adaptive estimation observer, which makes it less conservative to obtain stability conditions. The uniformly ultimately bounded stability conditions of the estimated error dynamics are given by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed method.

Still, there is variability in the impact of various PPI activities across people. In two studies, we examine strategies for personalizing a program of PPI activities to efficiently increase subjective well-being. In Study 1 (N = 516), we examined participants' beliefs about and employment of various PPI activity selection strategies. Participants favored self-selection over weakness-based, strength-based, or random activity assignments. When making activity selections for themselves, they reported using the weakness-based strategy the most. The tendency to make weakness-based activity selections related to negative affect whereas strengths-based activity selections related to positive affect. In Study 2 (N = 112), we randomly assigned participants to complete a set of five PPI activities allocated either randomly, based on their skill weaknesses, or based on their self-selections. Completing life-skills lessons significantly increased subjective well-being from baseline to post-test. Furthermore, we found evidence for added benefits in terms of subjective well-being, broad well-being outcomes, and skills improvement of the weakness-based and self-selection personalization strategies compared with the random assignment of these activities. We discuss the implications for research, practice, and the well-being of individuals and societies offered by the science of PPI personalization.	[Heintzelman, Samantha J.

It is shown that the eigenvalues of Dirac operators depend not only continuously but also smoothly on the coefficients, the boundary conditions, and the endpoints of the problem. Furthermore, the differential expressions of the eigenvalues as regards these parameters are given.

We studied two populations of Mylestoma sp., one of Saprodinium dentatum (Odontostomatea), two of Muranothrix felix sp. nov., and one of Muranothrix sp. (Muranotrichea) employing live observation, protargol impregnation, scanning electron microscopy, and 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Conspecificity of Mylestoma sp., described here, with a previously described species of this genus cannot be excluded since no species have been studied with modern methods. Phylogenetically, the genus Mylestoma is closely related to the odontostomatid Discomorphella pedroeneasi, although the phylogenetic position of class Odontostomatea itself remains unresolved. The newly described muranotrichean species, Muranothrix felix sp. nov., is morphologically similar to M. gubernata but can be distinguished by its fewer macronuclear nodules and fewer adoral membranelles; moreover, it is clearly distinguished from M. gubernata by its 18S rRNA gene sequence. Another population, designated here as Muranothrix sp., most likely represents a separate species.

Evidence of incipient reproductive isolation between native and non-native regions of some invasive alien species indicates that invasive speciation is closer than we expected. Some neo-allopatric populations are likely to qualify as distinguishable subspecies already. Given their trajectory, whether they will become new species is not an if, but a when. I present two decision tables to help to (1) assess the coining of new invasive species or subspecies with the current taxonomical approach or (2), introduce the term "neo " to name invasive neo-species resulting from synchronous allopatric speciation from a single, known, living ancestor. This latter case can be exemplified with the hypothetical names: "Ginkgo biloba neo americana ", "G. biloba neo europea ", etc.	[Montesinos, Daniel] James Cook Univ, Australian Trop Herbarium, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Montesinos, Daniel] Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Coimbra, Portugal	James Cook University; Universidade de Coimbra	Montesinos, D (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Trop Herbarium, Cairns, Qld, Australia.; Montesinos, D (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Ctr Funct Ecol, Coimbra, Portugal.	daniel.montesinos@jcu.edu.au	Montesinos, Daniel/A-9070-2012	Montesinos, Daniel/0000-0003-2893-0878					55	0	0	5	8	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0040-0262	1996-8175		TAXON	Taxon	2023 FEB 20	2023										10.1002/tax.12884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tax.12884		FEB 2023	7	Plant Sciences; Evolutionary Biology	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Plant Sciences; Evolutionary Biology	9D7YD		hybrid, Green Accepted			2023-10-18	WOS:000936312900001

Millimetre-scale pollen analysis of non-varved lacustrine sediments from Onepoto maar palaeolake, Auckland, reveals distal vegetation responses and landscape recovery following the ∼25.5-ka Oruanui supereruption, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE			English	Article						Auckland maar lakes; Oruanui supereruption; pollen analysis; vegetation dynamics; volcanic disturbance	LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM; NORTHERN NEW-ZEALAND; ANTARCTIC ICE CORES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; VOLCANIC-ERUPTIONS; LATE-HOLOCENE; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; TAUPO ERUPTION; LAKE PUPUKE; TEPHRA	The similar to 25.5-ka Oruanui supereruption (Taupo volcano, New Zealand) erupted >1100 km(3) of pyroclastic material during the Last Glacial Maximum. The impacts of this event on climate and the New Zealand environment remain unresolved, particularly on ecological timescales. Using sediment cores from Onepoto maar palaeolake, Auckland (similar to 240 km upwind from source), we have analysed pollen assemblages at contiguous 1-mm intervals, around an intact 3-cm layer of the Kawakawa-Oruanui Tephra to resolve and assess post-eruption vegetation impacts and landscape recovery. Sediments immediately above the tephra record a decline in the relative abundance of the dominant canopy species of Fuscospora, and concurrent increase in the abundances of grasses, herbs, ferns and shrubs. These changes reflect a brief (<10 years) part-defoliation of canopy trees, permitting more light to penetrate and to encourage sub-canopy vegetation growth. A short-lived volcanogenic cooling inferred from Antarctic ice core records may have contributed to the changes but cannot be separated from the immediate and direct ecological impacts of ashfall on vegetation following the eruption. Our results, here applied to the world's most recent supereruption, more generally demonstrate the value of millimetre-scale stratigraphic pollen analysis from non-varved lacustrine sediments as a tool for assessing past eruptive impacts on sub-decadal timescales.

The diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is based on clinical findings, positive Darier's sign, and histopathology, if necessary. MethodsMedical records of 86 children with CM diagnosed during a 35-year long period were reviewed. Most patients (93%) developed CM during the first year of life (median age 3 months). Clinical features at presentation and during the follow-up period were analyzed. Baseline serum tryptase level was measured in 28 patients. ResultsA total of 85% of patients had maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis/urticaria pigmentosa (MPCM/UP), 9% had mastocytoma, and 6% had diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM). Boy to girl ratio was 1.1:1. Fifty-four of 86 patients (63%) were followed from 2 to 37 years (median 13 years). Complete resolution was registered in 14% of mastocytoma cases, 14% of MCPM/UP, and in 25% of DCM patients. After the age of 18, skin lesion persisted in 14% mastocytoma, 7% MCPM/UP, and 25% children with DCM. Atopic dermatitis was diagnosed in 9.6% of patients with MPCM/UP. Three of 28 patients had elevated serum tryptase. Prognosis in all patients was good, and there were no signs of progression to systemic mastocytosis (SM). ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, our results represent the longest single-center follow-up study of childhood-onset CM. We found no complications of massive mast cell degranulation or progression to SM.

Breeding high-protein pigeonpea genotypes and their agronomic and biological assessments	PLANT BREEDING			English	Review						Cajanus cajan; high-protein selections; nutritional parameters; wild species donors	CAJANUS-CAJAN; TRANSGRESSIVE SEGREGATION; SEED PROTEIN; GRAIN-YIELD; INHERITANCE; GENETICS; QUALITY	Proteins, inevitable for nutritional security of human beings and legumes, by far, are the cheapest source of this vital nutrient. The escalating prices and never halting population growth limit the per capita availability of protein-rich legumes. In view of limited land resource and need to grow other food crops, the greater protein harvests are possible only by increasing the protein levels of popularly grown legumes. In this context, attempts were made for raising the protein content in pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] through traditional plant breeding tools. For this, the high-protein trait was successfully transferred from wild relatives of pigeonpea to the cultivated types. In the derived inbred lines, the protein content was significantly enhanced from 20% - 22% to 28% - 30%. Two high-protein lines HPL 40 and HPL 8 also produced 2100 and 1660 kg/ha grain yield, respectively. This simply means that, in comparison with traditional cultivars, the cultivation of high-protein lines will provide additional 100 kg/ha of digestible protein to the farming family. This paper, besides describing the breeding procedures, also discusses the accomplishments of this breeding endeavour with respect to its various nutritional and biological properties.	[Saxena, K.

J	Schropp, S; Tsigas, M				Schropp, Simon; Tsigas, Marinos			Designing 'optimal' sanctions on Russian imports	WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article						computable general equilibrium; economic impact; economic sanctions; GTAP; import tariff; international trade; quantitative trade models; Russia		Restricting Russian imports is an important instrument in Allies' sanction toolbox. Rather than arbitrarily choosing the set of targeted imported products and the level of import tariff increases (as is typically done in the literature), we follow the recent contributions on 'optimal sanction' strategies. We apply a workhorse computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, GTAP, in a way that enables us to endogenise the scope of sectors targeted, the magnitude of tariff increases and the disbursement of tariff revenues. This allows us to identify sets of Allied import restrictions that best achieve the Allies' objectives of inflicting the highest economic pain on Russia while at the same time keeping self-harm to Allies as low and as equitably distributed as possible. With regard to scope, we find that, instead of targeting Russian imports across the board, the Allies fare better when limiting their import sanctions to products from the eight most-imported Russian sectors. Regarding optimal tariff levels, we find that, rather than imposing all-out import bans, tariff increases in the range of 20-25 percentage points best achieve the Allies' objectives. Finally, the Allied coalition could benefit from a burden-sharing arrangement in which proceeds generated from the additional tariff rents are redistributed among Allies, and other cash transfers are allowed for. Doing so would result in a more equitable distribution of economic losses among Allied countries-at hardly any additional 'cost' to the coalition (in terms of extra losses to Allies or reduced losses to Russia). Such arrangement could significantly strengthen cohesion, resilience, and longevity of the Allied coalition, and thus ought to become a component of an optimal sanction strategy. As an alternative to redistributing tariff rents among coalition countries, Allies could consider using those funds towards supporting Ukraine directly. Doing so would involve a small sacrifice by Allies and would scarcely compromise the effectiveness of Allied sanctions. However, it could greatly help mitigating the human catastrophe unfolding in and around Ukraine.

Baseline cohort characteristics, treatment effects and adverse event rates were derived from the 40-week SURPASS-2 trial. Intensification to insulin therapy occurred when HbA1c reached 7.5%, in line with American Diabetes Association recommendations. Direct costs in 2021 US dollars (US$) and health state utilities were derived from published sources. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually.Results: All three doses of tirzepatide were associated with lower diabetes-related complication rates, improved life expectancy, improved quality-adjusted life expectancy and higher direct costs versus semaglutide. This resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$ 75 803, 58 908 and 48 785 per quality-adjusted life year gained for tirzepatide 5, 10 and 15 mg, respectively, versus semaglutide. Tirzepatide remained cost-effective versus semaglutide over a range of sensitivity analyses.Conclusions: Long-term projections based on the SURPASS-2 trial results indicate that 5, 10 and 15 mg doses of tirzepatide are likely to be cost-effective versus semaglutide 1.0 mg for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States.

Ballistic Ejection of Microdroplets from Overpacked Interfacial Assemblies	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						explosive emulsification; magnetic field; magnetic nanoparticle surfactants; overpacked interfacial assemblies	SPONTANEOUS EMULSIFICATION; WATER; ADSORPTION; INSTABILITY; EMULSIONS; DROPLETS; DYNAMICS; TENSION	Spontaneous emulsification, resulting from the assembly and accumulation of surfactants at liquid-liquid interfaces, is an interfacial instability where microdroplets are generated and diffusively spread from the interface until complete emulsification. Here, it is shown that an external magnetic field can modulate the assembly of paramagnetic nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid-liquid interfaces to trigger an oversaturation in the areal density of the NPSs at the interface, as evidenced by a marked reduction in the interfacial tension, gamma, and corroborated with a magnetostatic continuum theory. Despite the significant reduction in gamma, the presence of the magnetic field does not cause stable interfaces to become unstable. Upon rapid removal of the field, however, an explosive ejection of a plume of microdroplets from the surface occurs, a dynamical interfacial instability which is termed explosive emulsification. This explosive event rapidly reduces the areal density of the NPSs to its pre-field level, stabilizing the interface. The ability to externally suppress or trigger the explosive emulsification and controlled generation of tens of thousands of microdroplets, uncovers an efficient energy storage and release process, that has potential applications for controlled and directed delivery of chemicals and remotely controlled soft microrobots, taking advantage of the ferromagnetic nature of the microdroplets.

Herein, it is demonstrated that the classical Y6-based binary device can be stabilized by using its derivative of ZCCF3 as the third component, which is designed with the replacing of the thiadiazole group on Y6 with the trifluoromethyl substituted diazepine unit. ZCCF3 delivers not only higher glass transition temperature (T-g) than Y6 but also have hyper-miscibility with Y6, contributing to a favorable diffusion-limited Y6:ZCCF3 alloy when blended with polymer donor. Consequently, a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.54% is achieved in the optimal PM6: Y6: ZCCF3 devices, which can retain their 80% initial efficiency of up to 360 h. This study highlights the importance of high T-g of the third component and its derived hyper-miscible accepter alloys in achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs.

J	Bai, TM; Liu, N				Bai, Taomin; Liu, Na			RNA-binding protein PUM2 promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia via competitively binding to RBM5 3′UTR with miR-28-5p	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY			English	Article						microRNA-28-5p; Pumilio2; RNA-binding motif protein 5; T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia	TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; CANCER CELLS; EXPRESSION; PROLIFERATION; GENES	Objective: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy, and T-ALL patients are prone to early disease relapse and suffer from poor outcomes. The crucial function of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) has been reported in the progression of cancers by regulating the expression of transcripts. This study aimed to reveal the role and molecular regulatory mechanism of RBP Pumilio2 (PUM2) in T-ALL. Methods: The expression of genes was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. The viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of T-ALL cells were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and flow cytometry analysis. Luciferase reporter, RNA pulldown, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to confirm the binding of PUM2 to RBM5. The combination between RNA-binding motif protein 5 (RBM5) and microRNA (miR)-28-5p was validated using luciferase reporter assay. Results: Our data revealed that PUM2 was highly expressed in T-ALL blood samples and cell lines. PUM2 knockdown suppressed the proliferation but accelerated the apoptosis of T-ALL cells in vitro. Additionally, RBM5 exhibited a low expression level in T-ALL samples and cells. PUM2 negatively regulated RBM5 via targeting its 3'untranslated region (3'UTR). Moreover, PUM2 competitively bound to RBM5 3'UTR with miR-28-5p. Rescue experiments showed that RBM5 knockdown reversed the anti-tumor effects mediated by PUM2 knockdown in T-ALL cells. Conclusion: PUM2 plays as a novel oncogenic RBP in T-ALL by competitively binding to RBM5 mRNA with miR-28-5p.

At the same time, gender-related differences have rarely been explored, raising the question whether men and women with OB and OB + BED may require differently tailored treatments.Method: We retrospectively compared pre- versus post-treatment data in a matched sample of n = 180 men and n = 180 women with OB or OB + BED who received inpatient treatment.Results: We found that men displayed higher weight loss than women independent of diagnostic group. In addition, men with OB + BED showed higher weight loss than men with OB after 7 weeks of treatment.Conclusions: The present findings add to an emerging yet overall still sparse body of studies comparing phenotypical features and treatment outcomes in men and women with OB and OB + BED; implications for further research are discussed.Clinical Trial Registration: The study was prospectively registered with the German Clinical Trial Register as part of application DRKS00028441.

J	Butters, A; Kersbergen, I; Holmes, J; Field, M				Butters, Anna; Kersbergen, Inge; Holmes, John; Field, Matt			Temporary abstinence challenges: What do we need to know?	DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW			English	Editorial Material							SELF-EFFICACY; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; DRY JANUARY; DRINKING; INTERVENTION; BEHAVIOR	Participation in temporary abstinence challenges (TAC) continues to increase with campaigns established in several countries. Temporarily abstaining from alcohol as part of such challenges is associated with ongoing benefits including reductions to alcohol consumption after the TAC. We identified three research priorities regarding TACs which are outlined in this paper. First, the role of temporary abstinence itself is unclear with post-TAC reductions in alcohol consumption still apparent among participants who do not remain fully abstinent throughout the challenge. It is necessary to establish to what degree temporary abstinence itself, rather than the combination of abstinence and the additional supports provided by TAC organisers (e.g., mobile applications, online support groups), contributes to changes in consumption after the TAC. Second, little is known about the psychological changes underlying these changes in alcohol consumption, with conflicting evidence as to whether increases in someone's belief in their ability to avoid drinking mediates the association between participation in a TAC and reductions in consumption afterwards. Other potential psychological and social mechanisms of change have been subjected to little, if any, scrutiny. Third, evidence of increased consumption post-TAC among a minority of participants indicates a need to establish for whom or in what circumstances participation in a TAC may result in unintended negative consequences. Focussing research in these areas would increase the confidence with which participation could be encouraged. It would also enable campaign messaging and additional supports to be prioritised and tailored to be as effective as possible in facilitating long-term change.

Nonetheless, the intrinsic mechanism of CE still remains controversial. Herein, based on first-principles theory, the underlying mechanism in CE is systematically investigated between metallic MXenes and semiconductive MoS2. The results show that the work functions of contacting materials dominate the direction of electron transfer during CE process. That is, the electron will be transferred from the material with low work function to the one with high work function. The theoretical prediction is verified experimentally through investigating triboelectric probes based on MXenes and MoS2 nanomaterials. Additionally, it is noted that the interfacial potential barrier and the work function difference together modulate the amount of transferred electron. Electron transfer mainly occurs in the repulsive forces region where the interaction distance between the two materials is shorter than the normal bonding length. The quantum calculation results agree well with the Wang transition theory. Furthermore, it is also noticed that, due to the wave-particle duality of electron, electron transfer will obviously occur at the attractive force region when the two contacting materials exhibit a larger work function difference.

This study evaluates the synergistic effect of nickel doping in spinel zinc ferrite to enhance the photocatalytic performance of magnetic nanoparticles. Herein, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), differential reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)/Map, and vibrating-sample magnetometry (VSM) techniques were used to evaluate Ni0.25Zn0.75Fe2O4 MNPs synthesis by a sol-gel method. The produced nanoparticles have a surface area of 20.325 m(2) g(-1). At room temperature, the nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetic characteristics and can be readily separated from the aqueous solution. The bandgap has been determined to be 1.83 eV using Tauc's plot. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of as-prepared Ni0.25Zn0.75Fe2O4 MNPs for aniline degradation under visible light irradiation was examined. The photocatalytic results demonstrate that nickel-doped zinc ferrite has high photocatalytic activity in aniline degradation. Additionally, Ni0.25Zn0.75Fe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highly magnetic in nature, which simplifies separation and repetitive reuse.

This study is the first to identify a novel circular RNA (circRNA), circTBC1D14, whose expression is significantly upregulated in TNBC. The authors confirm that high circTBC1D14 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. circTBC1D14-associated mass spectrometry and RNA-binding protein-related bioinformatics strategies indicate that FUS can interact with circTBC1D14, which can bind to the downstream flanking sequence of circTBC1D14 to induce cyclization. FUS is an essential biomarker associated with stress granules (SGs), and the authors find that hypoxic conditions can induce FUS-circTBC1D14-associated SG formation in the cytoplasm after modification by protein PRMT1. Subsequently, circTBC1D14 increases the stability of PRMT1 by inhibiting its K48-regulated polyubiquitination, leading to the upregulation of PRMT1 expression. In addition, FUS-circTBC1D14 SGs can initiate a cascade of SG-linked proteins to recognize and control the elimination of SGs by recruiting LAMP1 and enhancing lysosome-associated autophagy flux, thus contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and promoting tumor progression in TNBC. Overall, these findings reveal that circTBC1D14 is a potential prognostic indicator that can serve as a therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

J	Rigas, N; Merklein, M				Rigas, Nikolaos; Merklein, Marion			Characterization of the Tribological Behavior of Different Tool Coatings and Dry Lubricant for High-Strength Aluminum Alloys at Elevated Temperatures	ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						hot quenching and form; high-strength aluminum; tool coatings; wear	PERFORMANCE; AA7075; WEAR	The use of high-strength aluminum components in automotive manufacturing offers the opportunity to reduce vehicle weight significantly and provide new lightweight potentials. In the past, the so-called hot forming and quench process (HFQ) successfully demonstrates the potential for the production of complex-shaped components made out of age-hardenable high-strength aluminum alloys. Currently, no method permits wear-free quench forming without the use of lubricants. To fulfill the increasing ecological and economic requirements, it is necessary to identify wear-reducing techniques to promote this forming technology in the future. This contribution investigates the interaction of lubricant and tool coatings on the tribological performance during quench forming of the high-strength aluminum alloy AA7075 at elevated temperatures. For this purpose, the tribological behavior is investigated using both, flat strip drawing tests and deep drawing operations. Subsequently, the component quality is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that tool coatings are effective for the production of high-strength components in the HFQ process with minimal or even no lubrication and thus provide ecological as well as economic advantages.

Diagnosis, Prognosticators, and Management of Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis: Multidisciplinary Consensus Statement and Evidence-Based Review with Recommendations	INTERNATIONAL FORUM OF ALLERGY & RHINOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						antifungals; aspergillosis; fungus; immunosuppression; intracranial; invasive fungal sinusitis; management; mucormycosis; orbit; outcomes; surgery; survival	ORBITAL-CEREBRAL-MUCORMYCOSIS; SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES MORTALITY; INFECTIOUS-DISEASES SOCIETY; MARROW TRANSPLANT PATIENTS; BLACK TURBINATE SIGN; AMPHOTERICIN-B; RHINOCEREBRAL MUCORMYCOSIS; FROZEN-SECTION; ASPERGILLUS SINUSITIS; NEUTROPENIC PATIENTS	BackgroundAcute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is an aggressive disease that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment given its rapid progression. However, there is currently no consensus on diagnosis, prognosis, and management strategies for AIFS, with multiple modalities routinely employed. The purpose of this multi-institutional and multidisciplinary evidence-based review with recommendations (EBRR) is to thoroughly review the literature on AIFS, summarize the existing evidence, and provide recommendations on the management of AIFS. MethodsThe PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were systematically reviewed from inception through January 2022. Studies evaluating management for orbital, non-sinonasal head and neck, and intracranial manifestations of AIFS were included. An iterative review process was utilized in accordance with EBRR guidelines. Levels of evidence and recommendations on management principles for AIFS were generated. ResultsA review and evaluation of published literature was performed on 12 topics surrounding AIFS (signs and symptoms, laboratory and microbiology diagnostics, endoscopy, imaging, pathology, surgery, medical therapy, management of extrasinus extension, reversing immunosuppression, and outcomes and survival). The aggregate quality of evidence was varied across reviewed domains. ConclusionBased on the currently available evidence, judicious utilization of a combination of history and physical examination, laboratory and histopathologic techniques, and endoscopy provide the cornerstone for accurate diagnosis of AIFS. In addition, AIFS is optimally managed by a multidisciplinary team via a combination of surgery (including resection whenever possible), antifungal therapy, and correcting sources of immunosuppression. Higher quality (i.e., prospective) studies are needed to better define the roles of each modality and determine diagnosis and treatment algorithms.

This cross-sectional study investigated the impact of this unprecedented situation on sleeping patterns and emotionality in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN).Methods: Variations in sleeping patterns and emotionality of two groups of adolescents with AN, assessed before (N = 50) and during (N = 51) the Covid-19 lockdown were analysed. We further investigated these variations over time, considering the two lockdown periods in France.Results: Adolescents self-reported significantly more sleep difficulties and lower rates of positive emotions during lockdown, compared to those evaluated before it. Furthermore, present findings overall suggest that as the lockdown progresses, adolescents with AN show an increased deterioration of sleep quality, as indicated by greater insomnia severity levels. They also show a significant decrease in the subjective experience of positive emotionality, in particular in feelings of tenderness.Conclusions: These sleep and emotionality alterations may have amplified the severity and the incidence of AN in adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic. These features may therefore represent therapeutic targets to optimise care of adolescents with AN. This is particularly urgent, considering kinetics of the deterioration. Tools such as those provided by cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and by the positive psychology framework seem appropriate to guide clinicians in this context.Level Of Evidence: Level V, descriptive study (evaluation data retrospectively studied).

Subsequently, the cells received PBM (100 mW power, 3 or 6 J cm(-2) energy density) immediately after load cycle. RT-PCR was applied to assess the genes expression. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey test (P <= 0.05). We found that PBM in combination with orthodontic forces led to upregulation of bone resorption genes (RANKL and SOST) at the pressure side and their downregulation at the tension side. The expression of osteogenic genes (OPG and POSTN) increased at the tension side and decreased at the pressure side. PBM alone did not affect gene expression. In conclusion, these findings suggest that this PBM protocol may be effective in enhancement of the gene expression in favor of bone remodeling acceleration that should be confirmed in future animal and human studies.

This study examines organisational-level and nurse-level predictors of nurse-reported quality of care from a management perspective.Methods: We recruited 175 primary care nurses in 38 community health centres (CHCs) varying by size and ownership in Jinan, Tianjin, Shenzhen and Shanghai. Guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model, the organisation-level predictors comprised organisational structure, organisational culture, psychological safety and organisational support, while the nurse-level predictors included organisational commitment and organisational citizenship behaviour. Nurse-reported quality of care was measured by two questions: "How do you rate the quality of care that you provide? " and "Do you often receive complaints from patients or their family members at work? " Multilevel linear regression models were used to examine the predictors of nurse-reported quality of care.Results: Among the four organisation-level predictors, organisational structure, psychological safety and organisational support were positive predictors of nurse-reported quality of care. Nurses working in CHCs with highly hierarchical organisational structures (Coef. = 0.196, p = 0.000), a high level of organisational support (Coef. = 0.158, p = 0.017) and a high level of psychological safety (Coef. = 0.159, p = 0.035) were more likely to report high quality of care or less likely to receive medical complaints. In terms of nurse-level predictors, nurses willing to increase their knowledge through continuous education were more likely to report good quality of care (Coef. = 0.107, p = 0.049) and less likely to receive medical complaints from patients (Coef. = 0.165, p = 0.041).Conclusions: Potential management levers to improve quality of nursing care include formalised organisational structures, strong organisational support and a psychologically safe environment as well as the provision of training to facilitate continuous education. Implementing these recommendations is likely to enhance the nursing quality in primary care.

Herein, a method to enhance the performance of a conductive hydrogel electrode is reported. The in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer is performed in the prestretched polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogel. After releasing the hydrogel, the polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticles can shrink with the PAAm substrate to form a dense and continuous conductive network. Due to the enhanced conductive networks, the prestretched PAAm-PANI conductive hydrogel with prestrain of 500% (PPCH5) electrode shows high areal capacitance of 509.9 mF cm(-2) at 0.5 mA cm(-2). The symmetrical stretchable supercapacitor based on PPCH5 electrodes exhibits a high areal capacitance of 219.7 mF cm(-2). The device shows high capacitance retention of 68.5% even when stretched to 200% strain and noncapacitance decays after 2000 stretching cycles at 100% strain. This strategy can be expanded to the carbon nanotubes (CNT)-filled hydrogel systems. The PAAm-PANI-CNT conductive hydrogel with prestrain of 500%-based supercapacitor shows specific capacitance of 1429.87 mF cm(-2). The results demonstrate that prestretching is a highly effective method to enhance capacitance and stretching stability of PANI hydrogel electrode for stretchable supercapacitors.

Herein, a polymer-based SCE membrane (SCE-66@67) with core-shell structured metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (UiO-66-NH2@67) as the fillers is presented. The SCE has combined the advantages of the two kinds of MOFs and shows a satisfying ionic conductivity (2.09 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 60 degrees C) and a wide electrochemical stability window of approximate to 5.0 V. The full cell (Li/SCE-66@67/LiFePO4) also maintains a high capacity of 120.9 mAh g(-1) at 3 C. This research might help to promote the development of future SCEs for ASSLBs.

Their accumulation in water effluents has become a serious problem that could be resolved by using zinc oxide (ZnO)-based photocatalysts.RESULTS: ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized through the precipitation method, using zinc nitrate and sodium carbonate as reagents. The as-synthesized powder was calcined for 4 h at 500 degrees C (2 degrees C min(-1)). X-Ray diffraction analysis confirmed a hexag-onal crystalline phase (wurtzite) with an average crystallite size of 38 nm. The Kubelka-Munk method was used to determine a band gap of 3.27 eV through UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific area of 12 m(2) g(-1) was obtained from N2 adsorption analysis. The photocatalytic activity of ZnO was evaluated under visible light (300 W) lamp, with 1 mg mL(-1) of photocatalyst and using phenol solutions at different concentrations of 5,10, 25, and 50 ppm; the obtained degradation percentages were 98%, 97%, 94%, and 71%, respectively. Three cycles were performed with the ZnO used in the reactions with phenol at 5 and 50 ppm, decreasing the degraded percentages to 87% and 65%, respectively. The generation of hydroxyl radicals was estimated for the ZnO and ZnO samples after three cycles by means of fluorescence spectroscopy analy-sis. It was observed that the first-used ZnO material generated a significant amount of hydroxyl radicals.CONCLUSION: When compared to ZnO after three cycles of reaction, the amount of generated hydroxyl radicals decreased. It was observed that the higher the amount of phenol, the lower the generation of hydroxyl radicals after reuse; this was probably due to the presence of some adsorbed by-products of the photocatalytic reaction on the surface of ZnO, as the FTIR spectrum of the post-reaction sample showed.(c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

Study designNarrative review. MethodsSeveral literature searches using broad terms such as "sleep deprivation," "veterinary," "physician," and "surgeon" were performed using PubMed and Google scholar. ResultsSleep deprivation and insufficient rest have clear and deleterious effects on job performance, which in healthcare occupations impacts patient safety and practice function. The unique requirements of a career in veterinary surgery, which may include on-call shifts and overnight work, can lead to distinct sleep challenges and chronic insufficient rest with resultant serious but often poorly recognized impacts. These effects negatively impact practices, teams, surgeons, and patients. The self-assessment of fatigue and performance effect is demonstrably untrustworthy, reinforcing the need for institution-level protections. While the issues are complex and there is no one-size-fits-all approach, duty hour or workload restrictions may be an important first step in addressing these issues within veterinary surgery, as it has been in human medicine. ConclusionSystematic re-examination of cultural expectations and practice logistics are needed if improvement in working hours, clinician well-being, productivity, and patient safety are to occur. Clinical significance (or Impact)A more comprehensive understanding of the magnitude and consequence of sleep-related impairment better enables surgeons and hospital management to address systemic challenges in veterinary practice and training programs.

Large carnivores avoid humans while prioritizing prey acquisition in anthropogenic areas	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Anthropocene; human influence; kill sites; linear features; predation risk; predator; prey; wildland-urban interface	WOLF KILL SITES; HABITAT SELECTION; RESOURCE SELECTION; PREDATION RISK; NATIONAL-PARK; GROUP-SIZE; ELK; LANDSCAPE; WOLVES; SCALE	Large carnivores are recovering in many landscapes where the human footprint is simultaneously growing. When carnivores encounter humans, the way they behave often changes, which may subsequently influence how they affect their prey. However, little research investigates the behavioural mechanisms underpinning carnivore response to humans. As a result, it is not clear how predator-prey interactions and their associated ecosystem processes will play out in the human-dominated areas into which carnivore populations are increasingly expanding.We hypothesized that humans would reduce predation risk for prey by disturbing carnivores or threatening their survival. Alternatively, or additionally, we hypothesized that humans would increase predation risk by providing forage resources that congregate herbivorous prey in predictable places and times.Using grey wolves Canis lupus in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, USA as a study species, we investigated 170 kill sites across a spectrum of human influences ranging from heavily restricted human activities on protected federal lands to largely unregulated activities on private lands. Then, we used conditional logistic regression to quantify how the probability of predation changed across varied types and amounts of human influences, while controlling for environmental characteristics and prey availability.Wolves primarily made kills in environmental terrain traps and where prey availability was high, but predation risk was significantly better explained with the inclusion of human influences than by environmental characteristics alone. Different human influences had different, and even converse, effects on the risk of wolf predation. For example, where prey were readily available, wolves preferentially killed animals far from motorized roads but close to unpaved trails. However, wolves responded less strongly to humans, if at all, where prey were scarce, suggesting they prioritized acquiring prey over avoiding human interactions.Overall, our work reveals that the effects of large carnivores on prey populations can vary considerably among different types of human influences, yet carnivores may not appreciably alter predatory behaviour in response to humans if prey are difficult to obtain. These results shed new light on the drivers of large carnivore behaviour in anthropogenic areas while improving understanding of predator-prey dynamics in and around the wildland-urban interface.

Transgenerational impact of grand-paternal lifetime exposures to both folic acid deficiency and supplementation on genome-wide DNA methylation in male germ cells	ANDROLOGY			English	Article						DNA methylation; epigenetics; folic acid; male germ cells; transgenerational	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; MTHFR DEFICIENCY; EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS; SPERM; OUTCOMES; FOLATE; HYPOMETHYLATION; INHERITANCE; METABOLISM; CONTRIBUTE	BackgroundDNA methylation (DNAme) erasure and reacquisition occur during prenatal male germ cell development; some further remodeling takes place after birth during spermatogenesis. Environmental insults during germline epigenetic reprogramming may affect DNAme, presenting a potential mechanism for transmission of environmental exposures across multiple generations. ObjectivesWe investigated how germ cell DNAme is impacted by lifetime exposures to diets containing either low or high, clinically relevant, levels of the methyl donor folic acid and whether resulting DNAme alterations were inherited in germ cells of male offspring of subsequent generations. Materials and methodsFemale mice were placed on a control (FCD), 7-fold folic acid deficient (7FD) or 10- to 20-fold supplemented (10FS and 20FS) diet before and during pregnancy. Resulting F1 litters were weaned on the respective diets. F2 and F3 males received control diets. Genome-wide DNAme at cytosines (within CpG sites) was assessed in F1 spermatogonia, and in F1, F2 and F3 sperm. ResultsIn F1 germ cells, a greater number of differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) were observed in spermatogonia as compared with F1 sperm for all folic acid diets. DMCs were lower in number in F2 versus F1 sperm, while an unexpected increase was found in F3 sperm. DMCs were predominantly hypomethylated, with genes in neurodevelopmental pathways commonly affected in F1, F2 and F3 male germ cells. While no DMCs were found to be significantly inherited inter- or transgenerationally, we observed over-representation of repetitive elements, particularly young long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). Discussion and conclusionThese results suggest that the prenatal window is the time most susceptible to folate-induced alterations in sperm DNAme in male germ cells. Altered methylation of specific sites in F1 germ cells was not present in later generations. However, the presence of DNAme perturbations in the sperm of males of the F2 and F3 generations suggests that epigenetic inheritance mechanisms other than DNAme may have been impacted by the folate diet exposure of F1 germ cells.

In this work, we describe rhodium-catalyzed enantioselective additions of aryl and vinyl boronic acids to cyclobutenone ketals. This transformation involves enantioselective carbometalation to give cyclobutyl-rhodium intermediates, followed by beta-oxygen elimination to afford enantioenriched enol ethers. Overall, this addition serves as a surrogate for Rh-catalyzed 1,4-additions to cyclobutenone.	[Egea-Arrebola, David; Goetzke, F.

However, their power densities still need to be improved aiming at broad practical applications. Here, a stretchable TEG that achieves comfortable wearability and outstanding output performance simultaneously is reported. When worn on the forehead at an ambient temperature of 15 degrees C, the stretchable TEG exhibits excellent power densities with a maximum value of 13.8 mu W cm(-2) under the breezeless condition, and even as high as 71.8 mu W cm(-2) at an air speed of 2 m s(-1), being one of the highest values for wearable TEGs. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that this stretchable TEG can effectively power a commercial light-emitting diode and stably drive an electrocardiogram module in real-time without the assistance of any additional power supply. These results highlight the great potential of these stretchable TEGs for power generation applications.

This systematic review aimed to address this absence, by providing a synthesis of evidence about the role that place-based arts can play in advancing social equity and addressing social disadvantage. Findings reveal a potential for the arts to create change across individual, community and societal levels, yet empirical evidence to support this potential is weak. Stronger evaluation frameworks that can support capturing the impact of localised place-based arts initiatives for translation into policy and practice are discussed.

Survival was 75%, which was not as high as the value of 100% observed for standard-TAC, because neither infection nor rejection could be prevented. By contrast, survival after whole LT was 100% as neither infection nor rejection occurred.Conclusions: The very early introduction of EVR + reduced-TAC after partial LT delayed liver regeneration, and made it difficult to manage the dose required to suppress both infection and rejection. On the other hand, EVR + reduced-TAC could be introduced safely very early after whole LT.

Metasurface-Enabled Holographic Lithography for Impact-Absorbing Nanoarchitected Sheets	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						holographic lithography; nanoarchitectures; optical metasurfaces	MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; ENERGY-ABSORPTION; FILMS; INDENTATION; DISSIPATION; PENETRATION; FABRICATION; LIGHTWEIGHT; DIFFUSION; GRAPHENE	Nanoarchitected materials represent a class of structural meta-materials that utilze nanoscale features to achieve unconventional material properties such as ultralow density and high energy absorption. A dearth of fabrication methods capable of producing architected materials with sub-micrometer resolution over large areas in a scalable manner exists. A fabrication technique is presented that employs holographic patterns generated by laser exposure of phase metasurface masks in negative-tone photoresists to produce 30-40 mu m-thick nanoarchitected sheets with 2.1 x 2.4 cm(2) lateral dimensions and approximate to 500 nm-wide struts organized in layered 3D brick-and-mortar-like patterns to result in approximate to 50-70% porosity. Nanoindentation arrays over the entire sample area reveal the out-of-plane elastic modulus to vary between 300 MPa and 4 GPa, with irrecoverable post-elastic material deformation commencing via individual nanostrut buckling, densification within layers, shearing along perturbation perimeter, and tensile cracking. Laser induced particle impact tests (LIPIT) indicate specific inelastic energy dissipation of 0.51-2.61 MJ kg(-1), which is comparable to other high impact energy absorbing composites and nanomaterials, such as Kevlar/poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) composite, polystyrene, and pyrolized carbon nanolattices with 23% relative density. These results demonstrate that holographic lithography offers a promising platform for scalable manufacturing of nanoarchitected materials with impact resistant capabilities.

However, high-accuracy detection of both strain intensity and direction with simple device/array structures is still insufficient. To overcome this limitation, an omnidirectional strain perception platform utilizing a stretchable strain sensor array with triangular-sensor-assembly (three sensors tilted by 45 degrees) coupled with machine learning (ML) -based neural network classification algorithm, is proposed. The strain sensor, which is constructed with strain-insensitive electrode regions and strain-sensitive channel region, can minimize the undesirable electrical intrusion from the electrodes by strain, leading to a heterogeneous surface structure for more reliable strain sensing characteristics. The strain sensor exhibits decent sensitivity with gauge factor (GF) of approximate to 8, a moderate sensing range (approximate to 0-35%), and relatively good reliability (3000 stretching cycles). More importantly, by employing a multiclass-multioutput behavior-learned cognition algorithm, the stretchable sensor array with triangular-sensor-assembly exhibits highly accurate recognition of both direction and intensity of an arbitrary strain by interpretating the correlated signals from the three-unit sensors. The omnidirectional strain perception platform with its neural network algorithm exhibits overall strain intensity and direction accuracy around 98% +/- 2% over a strain range of approximate to 0-30% in various surface stimuli environments.

With heightened concerns for the environment, considerable effort has been made to develop organic transient memristors to realize eco-friendly flexible neural networks. However, in the transient neural networks, achieving flexible memristors with biorealistic synaptic plasticity for energy efficient learning processes is still challenging. Herein, a biodegradable and flexible polymer-based memristor, suitable for the spike-dependent learning process, is demonstrated. An electrochemical metallization phenomenon for the conductive nanofilament growth in a polymer medium of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is analyzed and a PVA-based transient and flexible artificial synapse is developed. The developed device exhibits superior biodegradability and stable mechanical flexibility due to the high water solubility and excellent tensile strength of the PVA film, respectively. In addition, the developed flexible memristor is operated as a reliable synaptic device with optimized synaptic plasticity, which is ideal for artificial neural networks with the spike-dependent operations. The developed device is found to be effectively served as a reliable synaptic component with high energy efficiency in practical neural networks. This novel strategy for developing transient and flexible artificial synapses can be a fundamental platform for realizing eco-friendly wearable intelligent systems.

Synthesis of Polycarbonates from CO<sub>2</sub> Promoted by Immobilized Ionic Liquid Functionalized di-Mg Complex Catalyst	CHEMCATCHEM			English	Article						CO2 insertion; green polymers; polycarbonates; Robson ligand	CARBON-DIOXIDE; ALTERNATING COPOLYMERIZATION; PROPYLENE-OXIDE; CYCLOHEXENE OXIDE; ENANTIOSELECTIVE CATALYST; HETEROGENEOUS CATALYSIS; EPOXIDES; POLYMERIZATION; EFFICIENT; SURFACE	The capture and conversion of anthropogenic CO2 is a paramount challenge for our global ecosystem. An optimal way of to cope with the emitted CO2 is to efficiently convert it to value-added materials. Whereas nature sequesters CO2 by making sugar-based polymers, utilizing CO2 to make highly demanded synthetic polymers such as polycarbonates is of great value. The present work reports the synthesis of a new supported ionic liquid (IL) functionalized organic ligand that is able to accept metal sites. After incorporating di-nuclear magnesium, it was utilized as a single-component solid catalyst for the copolymerization of CO2 and cyclohexene oxide. The obtained solid catalyst was found to be active under mild CO2 pressures of (1-15 atm) giving a turnover number of up to 283 and turnover frequency up to 11.8 h(-1). To the authors knowledge, these rates are the highest obtained using a heterogeneous catalyst, maintaining 96-99 % polycarbonates selectivity and 97-99 % carbonate repeat units. In addition, the obtained polymers showed high molecular weights (16.7 to 11.7 kg/mol) with 1.05 to 1.6 dispersity (D). The catalyst was recycled 4 times, under regular laboratory conditions and without any intermediate reactivation steps, which provided similar to 3 g of polycarbonate for similar to 0.03 g catalyst (100 : 1) at 80 degrees C in neat cyclohexene oxide and 15 atm CO2.

ObjectiveTo further understand the pathogenesis of patients with PD with LID (PD-LID), we explored the structural and functional characteristics of SN in PD-LID using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MethodsTwenty-nine patients with PD-LID, 37 patients with PD without LID (PD-nLID), and 28 healthy control subjects underwent T1-weighted MRI, quantitative susceptibility mapping, neuromelanin-sensitive MRI, multishell diffusion MRI, and resting-state functional MRI. Different measures characterizing the SN were obtained using a region of interest-based approach. ResultsCompared with patients with PD-nLID and healthy control subjects, the quantitative susceptibility mapping values of SN pars compacta (SNpc) were significantly higher (P = 0.049 and P = 0.00002), and the neuromelanin contrast-to-noise ratio values in SNpc were significantly lower (P = 0.012 and P = 0.000002) in PD-LID. The intracellular volume fraction of the posterior SN in PD-LID was significantly higher compared with PD-nLID (P = 0.037). Resting-state fMRI indicated that PD-LID in the medication off state showed higher functional connectivity between the SNpc and putamen compared with PD-nLID (P = 0.031), and the functional connectivity changes in PD-LID were positively correlated with Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale total scores (R = 0.427, P = 0.042). ConclusionsOur multimodal imaging findings highlight greater neurodegeneration in SN and the altered nigrostriatal connectivity in PD-LID. These characteristics provide a new perspective into the role of SN in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD-LID. (c) 2023 The Authors.

MethodsForty-seven patients who received conventional RAMIE and 31 who received modified en bloc RAMIE at Henan Cancer Hospital were included in the study cohort. We compared the perioperative outcomes of conventional RAMIE and modified en bloc RAMIE. ResultsCompared with the conventional RAMIE group, the en bloc RAMIE group yielded a higher total number of lymph nodes (p = 0.001), especially thoracic lymph nodes (p = 0.025) and left recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) lymph nodes (p = 0.005). No notable differences were found in the rate of total complications (p = 0.663) or RLN injury (p = 0.891) between the two groups. The preoperative and postoperative serological indicators were comparable between the two groups. ConclusionsModified en bloc RAMIE was safe and feasible for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and improved lymph node dissection, especially thoracic and left RLN lymph node dissection.

The family owes its potential to its ferromagnetically (FM) ordered MnBi2Te4 septuple layers (SLs). However, the QAHE realization is complicated in MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 due to the substantial antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between the SLs. An FM state, advantageous for the QAHE, can be stabilized by interlacing the SLs with an increasing number n of Bi2Te3 quintuple layers (QLs). However, the mechanisms driving the FM state and the number of necessary QLs are not understood, and the surface magnetism remains obscure. Here, robust FM properties in MnBi6Te10 (n = 2) with T-c approximate to 12 K are demonstrated and their origin is established in the Mn/Bi intermixing phenomenon by a combined experimental and theoretical study. The measurements reveal a magnetically intact surface with a large magnetic moment, and with FM properties similar to the bulk. This investigation thus consolidates the MnBi6Te10 system as perspective for the QAHE at elevated temperatures.	[Tcakaev, Abdul-Vakhab; Zabolotnyy, Volodymyr.

Continuous adjoint-based shape optimization of a turbomachinery stage using a 3D volumetric parameterization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS			English	Article						continuous adjoint method; free form deformation; mixing plane; shape optimization; turbomachinery; volumetric NURBS parameterization		This work presents a novel volumetric parameterization technique along with the continuous adjoint method to support gradient-based CFD shape optimization of turbomachinery stages. The proposed parameterization retains axisymmetry and periodicity by acting on a transformed coordinate system. The same volumetric model controls the shape and the computational volume mesh in a seamless manner, avoiding the additional use of a mesh deformation tool. Moreover, it is differentiated to compute mesh sensitivities (i.e., derivatives of nodal coordinates with respect to the design variables) and is combined with the flow and continuous adjoint, multi-row solvers of the in-house PUMA software. Flow field solutions in successive rows communicate based on the mixing plane approach; the development of continuous adjoint to the latter is also presented in this article. The adjoint to the turbulence model and distance-from-the-wall (Hamilton-Jacobi) equations are solved, increasing the accuracy of the computed sensitivity derivatives. All these tools run on modern GPUs, accelerating both flow/adjoint solutions and shape/mesh manipulations. The capabilities of these tools are demonstrated in the shape optimization of the rotor blades of the MT1 high-pressure, transonic, turbine stage, aiming at maximum stage isentropic efficiency with constraints on stage reaction and inlet capacity.

Research on the NO regulation for various disease treatments has aroused wide concern. However, the lack of accurate, controllable, and persistent release of NO has significantly limited the application of NO therapy. Profiting from the booming development of advanced nanotechnology, a mass of nanomaterials with the properties of controllable release have been developed to seek new and effective NO nano-delivery approaches. Nano-delivery systems that generate NO through catalytic reactions exhibit unique superiority in terms of precise and persistent release of NO. Although certain achievements have been made in the catalytically active NO delivery nanomaterials, some basic but critical issues, such as the concept of design, are of low attention. Herein, an overview of the generation of NO through catalytic reactions and the design principles of related nanomaterials are summarized. Then, the nanomaterials that generate NO through catalytic reactions are classified. Finally, the bottlenecks and perspectives are also discussed in depth for the future development of catalytical NO generation nanomaterials.

Therefore, predicting the occurrence of HT before radiotherapy is necessary but still challenging. PurposeThis study proposes a hybrid machine learning model to predict the symptomatic radiation HT in rectal cancer patients using the combined demographic, clinical, dosimetric, and Radiomics features, and ascertains the most effective regions of interest (ROI) in CT images and predictive feature sets. MethodsA discovery dataset of 240 rectal cancer patients, including 145 patients with HT symptoms and a validation dataset of 96 patients (63 patients with HT) with different dose prescription were retrospectively enrolled. Eight ROIs were contoured on patient CT images to derive Radiomics features, which were then, respectively, combined with the demographic, clinical, and dosimetric features to classify patients with HT symptoms. Moreover, the survival analysis was performed on risky patients with HT in order to understand the HT progression. ResultsThe classification models in ROIs of bone marrow and femoral head exhibited relatively high accuracies (accuracy = 0.765 and 0.725) in the discovery dataset as well as comparable performances in the validation dataset (accuracy = 0.758 and 0.714). When combining the two ROIs together, the model performance was the best in both discovery and validation datasets (accuracy = 0.843 and 0.802). In the survival analysis test, only the bone marrow ROI achieved statistically significant performance in accessing risky HT (C-index = 0.658, P = 0.03). Most of the discriminative features were Radiomics features, and only gender and the mean dose in Irradvolume was involved in HT. ConclusionThe results reflect that the Radiomics features of bone marrow are significantly correlated with HT occurrence and progression in rectal cancer. The proposed Radiomics-based model may help the early detection of radiotherapy induced HT in rectal cancer patients and thus improve the clinical outcome in future.

We find that cap rates decline throughout the world over this period, reflecting a corresponding decline in the real rate of interest. In the cross-city analysis our most robust findings are that office cap rates are lower in wealthier cities, especially those that are either considered gateway cities or financial centers. In addition, cap rates tend to be higher in countries with lower credit ratings and higher inflation rates. We find that cap rates in suburban office markets are higher than in central business districts, and for a given metropolis, suburban cap rates are lower in suburbs with better public transport connections to the central business district. Finally, evidence from regressions with city fixed effects reveal that cap rates rise as the discount rate and vacancy rates increase and fall as cities get wealthier.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS			English	Article						air pollution; conventional semen parameters; lockdown; male infertility; sperm DNA fragmentation; TUNEL; PI assay	SEMEN QUALITY; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; PARTICULATE MATTER; OXIDATIVE STRESS; EXPOSURE; MEN; POPULATIONS; ASSOCIATION; CHROMATIN; HEALTH	In March 2020, the Italian government imposed a national lockdown which was almost completely removed in June 2020. Due to the abrupt stop of human activities, emissions of air pollutants decreased. Air pollution is an environmental risk factor for noncommunicable disease and mortality. Emerging evidence also suggests a role in male infertility. In this study, we compared sperm DNA fragmentation (sDF) levels and conventional semen parameters between subjects undergoing sDF determination and routine semen analysis in a single Italian centre, during about 6 months before (N = 119) and after lockdown (N = 105). After lockdown, we found an improvement of sperm progressive motility (48.00[38.50-58.00]% vs. 42.00[33.00-53.00]%) and sDF levels (as total: 24.79[18.33-33.97]% vs. 35.02[25.04-45.73]%, p < .001; brighter: 14.02[10.69-17.93]% vs 18.54[13.58-25.82]%, p < .001 and dimmer sDF: 9.24[5.64-15.78]% vs. 12.24[8.08-19.10]%, p < .01), mirrored by a decrease of leukocyte semen concentration (p < .01). The improvement of sperm motility and DNA quality was maintained after adjusting for leukocyte concentration and several conditions known to affect sperm motility and/or sDF levels. With a significant decrease in air pollution observed in Tuscany during and after lockdown, associated improvement in sperm motility and DNA quality in patients referred to the infertility clinic is suggestive of the potential role of air pollution in male infertility.

J	Chandler, D; Pugh, J				Chandler, David; Pugh, Jonathan			Abyssal geography	SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						abyss; relational; Black studies; ontology; Caribbean; Anthropocene		Today, we are held to live in the Anthropocene, bringing to an end modern binary imaginaries, such as the separation between Human and Nature, and with them Western assumptions of progress, linear causality and human exceptionalism. Much Western critical theory, from new or vital materialism to post- and more-than-human thinking, unsurprisingly reflects this internal crisis of faith in Eurocentric or Enlightenment reasoning. At the same time, a radically different critique of modernity has gained prominence in recent years, emerging from critical Black studies, which places the Caribbean at the centre of the development of a new and distinct mode of critical thought. In attempting to grasp the ways in which Caribbean thought and practice have been seen to enable a distinctive alternative non-Eurocentric imaginary, this paper heuristically sets out a paradigmatic framing of 'abyssal geography'. We emphasize two key points. The first is that abyssal thought is not grounded in abstract and timeless philosophical assumptions but figuratively draws upon aspects of Caribbean practices of resistance and survival, for example, from the Middle Passage, Plantation, carnival, creolization, dance forms and speculative fiction. The second is that abyssal work engages the legacies of modernity and coloniality by explicitly seeking to question the lure of ontology: seeking to disrupt, suspend and to problematize the modern project of the human and the world.

Intersectionality of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender in the Otolaryngology Match From 2013 to 2019	LARYNGOSCOPE			English	Article; Early Access						diversity; ethnicity; gender; intersectionality; match; physician workforce; race	CONCORDANCE	Objectives: Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in the otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) match have been described individually, but not intersectionally. Intersectionality recognizes how multiple forms of discrimination (e.g., sexism, racism) can have a combined effect. The objective of this study was to analyze racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in the OHNS match using an intersectional approach. Methods: Cross-sectional evaluation of data from otolaryngology applicants from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and of corresponding otolaryngology residents from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from 2013 to 2019. Data were stratified by race, ethnicity, and gender. The Cochran-Armitage tests assessed trends over time in the proportions of applicants and corresponding residents. Chi-square tests with Yates' continuity correction were performed to evaluate differences between the aggregate proportions of applicants and corresponding residents.Results: The proportion of White men in the resident pool was increased compared to the applicant pool (ACGME 0.417, ERAS 0.375; delta + 0.042; 95% CI 0.012 to 0.071; p = 0.03). This was also the case for White women (ACGME 0.206, ERAS 0.175; delta + 0.031; 95% CI 0.007 to 0.055; p = 0.05). In contrast, there was a smaller proportion of residents compared to applicants among Multiracial men (ACGME 0.014, ERAS 0.047; delta -0.033; 95% CI -0.043 to -0.023; p < 0.001) and Multiracial women (ACGME 0.010, ERAS 0.026; delta -0.016; 95% CI -0.024 to -0.008; p < 0.001).Conclusion: The findings of this study imply that White men have a persistent advantage, while several racial, ethnic, and gender minorities are disadvantaged in the OHNS match. Further research is necessary to examine why these differences exist in residency selection, including evaluation during the screening, reviewing, interviewing, and ranking stages.

The initial strategy for the construction of the carbon framework of the derivatives relied on the Suzuki reaction of 2,4,6-tribromobenzonitrile, and the addition of the aryl lithium species to nitrile to generate imine. However, the formed imines showed remarkable stability toward hydrolysis. Therefore, Suzuki cross-coupling was carried out with 2,4,6-tribromobenzaldehyde and the subsequent addition of organometallic species to the aldehyde. Oxidation of the resulting alcohol ensured the access to desired ketones. The importance of the developed modular strategy is underlined by the discovery of several derivatives with selective cytotoxic effects and potential anti-inflammatory activity superior to the effect of the natural product.

COVID has heightened the awareness of the potential for viral spread with the practice of visual fields modified. Mask artefacts can occur due to fogging of the inferior rim of the trail lens. Fortunately, the risk of airborne transmission when field testing is low. The 24-2c may be useful to detect early disease and the 10-2 more sensitive to detect advanced loss. The SITA faster test algorithm is able to reduce testing time thereby improving clinic efficiency, however, may show milder results for moderate or severe glaucoma. The technician has an important role of supervising the visual field performance to achieve reliable output. Home monitoring can provide earlier detection of progression and thus improve monitoring of glaucoma as well as reduce the burden of in-clinic assessments. Artificial Intelligence has been found to have high sensitivity and specificity compared to expert observers in detecting field abnormalities and progression as well as integrating structure with function. Although these advances will improve efficiency and guide accuracy, there will remain a need for clinicians to interpret the results and instigate management.

The composition and random structure of the copolymer were determined by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR analysis. DSC and TGA analysis showed that Cardo structure could significantly increase the glass transition temperature and thermal decomposition temperature. With the addition of BHEBN, the refractive index of copolymer was increased, but the thermal properties of copolymer were decreased. It is found that the contribution of naphthalene structure to the refractive index of the polymer material is higher than that of benzene structure. When the dosage of BHEBN is 42 mol %, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the copolymer is 141.8 degrees C, the maximum thermal decomposition temperature is 421.9 degrees C, the refractive index is 1.6535, the Abbe number is 21, the transmittance is 88.29 %, and the birefringence is negative 0.01x10(-3).

However, there is a growing awareness of immune-related adverse events (irAE). Especially ICI-mediated neurological adverse events (nAE(+)), are tough to diagnose and biomarkers to identify patients at risk are missing.Methods: A prospective register with prespecified examinations was established for ICI treated patients in December 2019. At the time of data cut -off, 110 patients were enrolled and completed the clinical protocol. Herein, cytokines and serum neurofilament light chain (sNFL) from 21 patients were analyzed.Results: nAE of any grade were observed in 31% of the patients (n =34/110). In nAE(+) patients a significant increase in sNFL concentrations over time was observed. Patients with higher-grade nAE had significantly elevated serum-concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP -1) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at baseline compared to individuals without any nAE (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Conclusion: Here, we identified nAE to occur more frequently than previously reported. Increase of sNFL during nAE confirms the clinical diagnosis of neurotoxicity and might be a suitable marker for neuronal damage associated with ICI therapy. Furthermore, MCP -1 and BDNF are potentially the first clinical -class nAE predictors for patients under ICI therapy.

J	Pousa, R; Costa, MH				Pousa, Raphael; Costa, Marcos Heil			Interactions between large-scale and mesoscale processes define long-term rainfall variability and availability of water resources in Western Bahia, Brazil	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						large-scale and mesoscale processes; rainfall variability; water resources	ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; NORTH-ATLANTIC; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS; AMO	Western Bahia, a region in Northeast Brazil highly dependent on water availability due to the large concentration of irrigated lands, has been suffering from decreasing precipitation in the last decades. The mean climate of Northeast Brazil and its variability have been linked to teleconnections with the Atlantic and Pacific sea surface temperatures, including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This study investigates how large-scale (AMO) and mesoscale (orographic) interactions are related to precipitation patterns in the region. Time series of precipitation and naturalized flows (corresponding to the flow that would occur in the river section if there were no anthropogenic actions) for the period 1981-2020 are analysed, indicating an average reduction of 11.5% in rainfall since the 1980s. The analyses show a significant (alpha = 0.05) rainfall reduction in the wettest months, the December and January bimester (DJ). A strong and significant negative correlation between AMO and precipitation (R = -0.62, alpha = 0.01) indicates a decrease in DJ rainfall when the AMO index is positive. The five rainiest and five driest DJ bimesters between 1981 and 2020 were selected to investigate the changes in atmospheric circulation. In the rainiest years, large-scale mechanisms interact with the local topography to promote a major convection centre over Western Bahia. The driest years show suppressed convection over the topographic gradient and a change in the convection centre several hundred kilometres to the west. The continued increase in temperatures in the North Atlantic may perpetuate the decline in Western Bahia precipitation, putting pressure on water availability and impacting economic activities in the region.

Reproductive isolation between diploid and tetraploid individuals in mixed-cytotype populations of <i>Lycium australe</i>	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Australia; cytotype; cytotype coexistence; DNA content; Lycium australe; polyploidy; RAD sequencing; reproductive isolation; Solanaceae; triploid block	EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS; PLOIDY POPULATIONS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION; SEED DEVELOPMENT; SEXUAL SYSTEM; POLYPLOIDY; ESTABLISHMENT; SOLANACEAE; MECHANISMS	PremiseWhole-genome duplication is considered a major mechanism of sympatric speciation due to the creation of strong and instantaneous reproductive barriers. Although postzygotic reproductive isolation between diploids and polyploids is often expected, the extent of reproductive incompatibility must be empirically determined and compared to patterns of genetic isolation to fully characterize the reproductive dynamics between cytotypes. MethodsWe investigated reproductive compatibility between diploid and tetraploid Lycium australe in two mixed-cytotype populations using (1) controlled crossing experiments to evaluate fruit and seed production and (2) germination trials to test seed viability following homoploid and heteroploid crosses. We contrast these experiments with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data set to measure genetic isolation between cytotypes and explore whether cytotype or population origin better explains patterns of genetic variation. Finally, we explore mating patterns using the observed germination rates of naturally produced seeds in each population. ResultsAlthough homoploid and heteroploid crosses resulted in similar fruit and seed production, reproductive isolation between co-occurring diploids and tetraploids was nearly complete, due to low seed viability following heteroploid crosses. Of 191,182 total SNPs, 21,679 were present in >= 90% of individuals and replicate runs using unlinked SNPs revealed strong clustering by cytotype and differentiation of tetraploids based on population origin. ConclusionsAs often reported, diploid and tetraploid L. australe experience strong postzygotic isolation via hybrid seed inviability. Consistent with this result, cytotype explained a greater amount of variation in the SNP data set than population origin, despite some evidence of historical introgression.	[Schneider, Derek J.

Thus, vehicular communications, which refer to information transmission between cars, pedestrians, and infrastructures, have lately gained popularity and been extensively explored due to their enormous potential to enable intelligent transportation and various safety applications. Manually piloted cars and automated vehicles can acquire relevant information via vehicular communications to enhance traffic security and boost entertainment services. The basic concept of automobile clouds was originally published in the literature not long ago, and several suggested structural approaches have been presented in this study thus far. Several academics have concentrated on the structural layout to address various problems and, as a result, satisfy user expectations in order to give dependable services. We examined various vehicular cloud topologies in this study. We also offered a complete summary of current network layer research on allowing efficient vehicle communications and examined specific security, architectural, and reliability concerns in vehicular clouds. Also, the taxonomy of vehicular networks was discussed in terms of the service link between vehicular networks and cloud computing. Ultimately, we discussed the research prospects available. The results showed that security and privacy challenges are among the most important challenges.

Alkyd-based art mediums have become an important group in the art field, because of their similar characteristics to traditional oils and exceptional drying properties. In this work, high solid alkyd-based art mediums have been synthesized by the monoglyceride and acidolysis processes. Multifunctional polyols and high unsaturated fatty acid sources were compared and used for alkyd synthesis. The use of a non-traditional oil of Peruvian origin is proposed. Resins have been characterized according to their physicochemical (acid number, viscosity, color and density) and drying properties. Drying tendencies were verified with the use of quartz crystal microbalance. Also, the behavior of the art mediums mixed with commercial oil paintings and a dry pigment, have also been evaluated. Results indicate that resins containing the polyol with the highest functionality are more viscous and have fewer tendencies to yellowing, while non-traditional Peruvian oil is the best option for creating light-colored art mediums. Alkyd mediums prepared by the monoglyceride method gave to oil paintings better characteristics and drying behavior on canvas.

However, only a few palaeohydrological records exist in Tajikistan. To obtain a long-term perspective on hydrological changes in Tajikistan, we developed, for the first time, a streamflow reconstruction from September of the previous year to June of the current one in the Kafirnigan River basin, based on Juniperus semiglobosa tree-ring width indices from the Iskanderkul area in northern Tajikistan. The streamflow reconstruction explains 40% of the actual streamflow variance during the period 1939-1993. Spatial correlation analyses with gridded precipitation data indicate that our streamflow reconstruction contains a strong regional hydroclimatic signal for southern Central Asia. The high and low intervals of our streamflow reconstruction are closely related to the interdecadal variations of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our reconstructed streamflow is significantly correlated with sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean, indicate the existence of remarkable 11-, 5.6-5.7-, 4.3-, 2.6-, 2.3- and 2.0-year cycles, and suggest a relationship between southern Central Asian streamflow variations and ENSO activity.

Although sufficient information regarding their association with cancer exists, there is limited evidence linking the genetic variants of phospholipid-transporting ATPase family genes to prostate cancer in humans. MethodsIn this study, we investigated the association of 222 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight phospholipid-transporting ATPase genes with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of 630 patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. ResultsAfter multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple testing correction, we found that ATP8B1 rs7239484 was remarkably associated with CSS and OS after ADT. A pooled analysis of multiple independent gene-expression datasets demonstrated that ATP8B1 was under-expressed in tumor tissues and that a higher ATP8B1 expression was associated with a better patient prognosis. Moreover, we established highly invasive sublines using two human prostate cancer cell lines to mimic cancer progression traits in vitro. The expression of ATP8B1 was consistently downregulated in both highly invasive sublines. ConclusionOur study indicates that rs7239484 is a prognostic factor for patients treated with ADT and that ATP8B1 can potentially attenuate prostate cancer progression.

Bruce; Baumann, Andrea; Walton-Roberts, Margaret			A few "big players": Systems approach to immigrant employment in a mid-sized city	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHIES-GEOGRAPHIES CANADIENNES			English	Article; Early Access						employment integration; immigrants; mid-sized cities; systems approach	WORK	Canada's immigration policy is regarded globally as a best practice model for selecting highly skilled migrants. Yet, upon arrival many immigrants face challenges integrating into employment. Where immigrants settle is one factor that has been shown to impact on employment integration. In Canada, regionalization policies have resulted in more immigrants settling in small to mid-sized cities. It is important to understand how these local systems are organized to promote immigrant integration into employment. Using a systems approach, this paper presents a case study of immigrant employment in a mid-sized city in Ontario, Canada. Through a document review and stakeholder interviews, a systems map was developed, and local perspectives were analyzed. Results demonstrate that in a mid-sized city, few organizations play a large role in immigrant employment. The connections between these core organizations and the local labour market are complex. Any potential challenges to the system that interfere with these connections can cause a delay for newcomers seeking employment. As cities begin to experience growth driven by immigration, there is a need to ensure local services are not only available but also working effectively within the larger employment system.

J	Eberhart, M				Eberhart, Marlene			Aretino: conjuring the sensuous city	RENAISSANCE STUDIES			English	Article						early modern city; early modern senses; Pietro Aretino; sensory history; Venice	SPACES	This article examines Pietro Aretino's promotion and critique of the sensorial aspects of the physical, the political and the sociable city through a selection of his letters and the three comedies La Cortigiana, Il Marescalco and La Talanta. It explores the shared physical and social experiences that Aretino counts on in order for his words to resonate with his readers, especially with regard to Venice and Rome, viewed at times through the lens of Venice. Aretino lives during a time of intense sensorial concerns, from the imitation of nature promoted in works of art to the regulation of the urban sensorium through the control of speech and print, sumptuary laws and public performance. Drawing upon his own early experience of painting, writing poetry and perhaps street performance, Aretino evokes those concerns and displays a particularly urban sensibility as he seizes the opportunities offered by printing and the expansion of vernacular texts to explore what it is to inhabit the early modern Italian city in all its jumbly, chaotic and colourful sensorial 'noise'.

With the collected data, we constructed a CDR based on a sequential approach based on age, clinical toxic signs, urinalysis and procalcitonin level. We evaluated its diagnostic performances to identify IBI and its potential impact on antibiotic use.Results: Among the 1061 children (IBI 11/1061, 1.0%), 693 (65.3%) were classified at low or intermediate risk of IBI, with an IBI prevalence of 0%. The sensitivity and specificity of the CDR to predict IBI were 100% and 73.9%. Negative and positive predictive value were 100% and 3.9%, respectively. Using this new CDR, the current antibiotics exposure would theoretically be reduced from 33.6% to 24.1%.Conclusion: The promising interest of this clinical decision rule, using simple and accessible biological and clinical tools, needs to be confirm with an external validation study, which will allow its use in clinical practice.

Here, through a suppressor screen for the smo2 mutant, we found that lack of a ribosomal stress response mediator, ANAC082 partially restored growth defects of the smo2 mutant, indicating SMO2 is required for the repression of nucleolar stress. Consistently, the smo2 knock-out mutant exhibited typical phenotypes characteristic of ribosome biogenesis mutants, such as pointed leaves, aberrant leaf venation, disrupted nucleolar structure, abnormal distribution of rRNA precursors, and enhanced tolerance to aminoglycoside antibiotics that target ribosomes. SMO2 interacted with ROOT INITIATION DEFECTIVE 2 (RID2), a methyltransferase-like protein required for pre-rRNA processing. SMO2 enhanced RID2 solubility in Escherichia coli and the loss of function of SMO2 in plant cells reduced RID2 abundance, which may result in abnormal accumulation of FIBRILLARIN 1 (FIB1) and NOP56, two key nucleolar proteins, in high-molecular-weight protein complex. Taken together, our results characterized a novel plant ribosome biogenesis factor, SMO2 that maintains the abundance of RID2, thereby sustaining ribosome biogenesis during plant organ growth.

Monitoring of ecosystems is fundamental to our understanding of how ecosystem change impacts resources and is critical for developing data-based sustainability. Thus, the design and development of optimized sensors for ecosystem monitoring have received increasing attention. This review provides a comprehensive overview of systematic sensor design strategies for ecosystem monitoring from the material level to the form factor level. We discuss the fundamental transducing mechanisms of a representative sensor system including optical, electrical, and electrochemical sensors.

Through this process, called solvent exchange with bubbles (SEB), the Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte is synthesized with a particle size below 800 nm and sufficient ionic conductivity of 1.54 mS/cm at 25 degrees C. In addition, the ASSB cell consisting of the cathode electrode with Li6PS5Cl synthesized by the SEB exhibited a high capacity of 176 mAh/g at 0.1 C (55 degrees C) owing to the improved contact between the electrode and solid electrolyte. In particular, the rate capability of the cell is superior to that of a cell with Li6PS5Cl prepared by ball milling.

J	Lalanne, M				Lalanne, Marie			Network-based Appointments and Board Diversity	ECONOMICA			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; SMALL-WORLD; FIRM; DIRECTORS; EXPERTISE; SELECTION; COSTS; OWNERSHIP; PATRONAGE	This paper investigates the occurrence of network-based appointments and its impact on board diversity. I use data on independent board appointments between 2006 and 2012 in large publicly listed firms in the USA, and exploit directors' CVs to uncover past social connections between candidates and current directors along various dimensions-from employment, education, army and social activities. I first estimate the probability of obtaining a board seat when being socially connected to members of the recruiting board. Using different assumptions to recreate the unobserved pool of candidates, I find that being socially connected to someone on the board increases the chances of obtaining the board seat between 35.8 and 41.1 percentage points, after controlling for a large set of firm and director characteristics together with firm and director fixed effects. I then study the change in board diversity following these appointments. While appointments of new independent directors affect board diversity positively, those that are made through networks are not significantly different. However, this is likely the result of appointing directors from a significantly homogeneous sample of individuals, whether connected or not, and suggests that in order to increase board diversity, efforts should be directed towards increasing diversity in the pool of candidates.

However, such interesting materials hitherto are only limited to compounds with a monotonous three-dimensional structure and show a low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, an Mn2+-doped two-dimensional (2D) layered HDP PPA(4)NaInCl(8) (PPA(+) = C6H5(CH2)(3)NH3+) showing promising photoluminescence properties is reported. The large separation between the adjacent inorganic sheets and the good dissolution of Mn2+ in the layered structure endow PPA(4)NaInCl(8):Mn2+ with efficient red emission and a record PLQY of 69.90%. The spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory calculations indicate that the inherent absorption and luminescence stem from the inserted organic cations PPA(+) in PPA(4)NaInCl(8). An energy transfer process occurs between the singlet excitons from PPA(+) and Mn2+, resulting in tunable emission accompanied by the variation of Mn2+ concentration. These results provide several new fundamental insights on doping and doped 2D layered HDPs, which enhances the understanding of structure-property relations in this important family.

However, identifying the direction of the productivity-stability relationship remains challenging because ecological stability has multiple components that can display neutral, positive or negative covariations. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the direction of the productivity-stability relationship depends on the biotic interactions and abiotic conditions that underlie ecosystem productivity and stability. We decipher the relationships between grassland productivity and two components of its stability in four habitat types with contrasting environments and flora.Location: France.Time period: 2000-2020.Major taxa: Grassland plant species.Methods: We used c. 20,000 vegetation plots spread across French permanent grasslands and remotely sensed vegetation indices to quantify grassland productivity and temporal stability. We decomposed stability into constancy (i.e., temporal invariability) and resistance (i.e., maximum deviation from average) and deciphered the direct and indirect effects of abiotic (namely growing season length and nitrogen input) and biotic (namely plant taxonomic diversity, trait diversity and community-weighted mean traits) factors on productivity-stability relationships using structural equation models.Results: We found a positive relationship between productivity and constancy and a negative relationship between productivity and resistance in all habitats. Abiotic factors had stronger effects on productivity and stability compared with biotic factors. A longer growing season enhanced grassland productivity and constancy. Nitrogen input had positive and negative effects on grassland productivity and resistance, respectively. Trait values affected the constancy and resistance of grassland more than taxonomic and trait diversity, with effects varying from one habitat to another. Productivity was not related to any biotic factor.Main conclusions: Our findings reveal how vital it is to consider both the multiple components of stability and the interaction between environment and biodiversity to gain an understanding of the relationships between productivity and stability in real-world ecosystems, which is a crucial step for sustainable grassland management.

J	Mclaughlin, S; Overell, J; Rossaak, J				Mclaughlin, Scott; Overell, James; Rossaak, Jeremy			Opioid prescribing patterns following common general surgery procedures in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						pain; postoperative; postoperative care		BackgroundGlobal increases in opioid prescribing and misuse have prompted calls for closer regulation. Opioid prescription following surgery may lead to long term opioid use. A study was conducted evaluating opioid prescriptions on hospital discharge following common general surgery operations in the Bay of Plenty. MethodsRetrospective observational study over a two-year period in two regional New Zealand hospitals. Six hundred and eleven patients aged 18-64 years were assessed. Patients with complications, readmission, and a prescription of opioids in the preceding 3 months were excluded. ResultsA total of 460 patients (165 Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LC), 200 Laparoscopic Appendicectomy (LA) and 95 Open Inguinal Hernia Repair (OIHR)) were included in analysis. Opioids were prescribed to 53% of LC, 55% of LA, and 60% of OIHR patients, with a mean of 75.8 Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MMEs), 75.3 MMEs, and 82.8 MMEs respectively. Seven percent of patients (18/254) received a second opioid prescription within 3 months, and of those only 1.6% (4/254) received a further prescription between 3 and 6 months from discharge. Opioid prescribing did not correlate with operation, ethnicity, age, length of stay, or gender, except for males receiving a more MMEs than females following LC (mean 102.0 MMEs versus 65.4 MMEs, P = 0.017). ConclusionThis study shows a rate of opioid prescribing lower than the USA, and greater than seen in an Australian setting.

Beyond the genomes of <i>Fulvia fulva</i> (syn. <i>Cladosporium fulvum</i>) and <i>Dothistroma septosporum</i>: New insights into how these fungal pathogens interact with their host plants	MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Review						Dothistroma needle blight (DNB); effector proteins; genome sequences; host susceptibility and resistance; pathogen diversity; secondary metabolites; tomato leaf mould	NEEDLE BLIGHT PATHOGEN; RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE; MATING-TYPE GENES; DISEASE-RESISTANCE; AVIRULENCE GENE; PASSALORA-FULVA; CF-4-MEDIATED RESISTANCE; LEPTOSPHAERIA-MACULANS; EXTRACELLULAR PROTEINS; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS	Fulvia fulva and Dothistroma septosporum are closely related apoplastic pathogens with similar lifestyles but different hosts: F. fulva is a pathogen of tomato, whilst D. septosporum is a pathogen of pine trees. In 2012, the first genome sequences of these pathogens were published, with F. fulva and D. septosporum having highly fragmented and near-complete assemblies, respectively. Since then, significant advances have been made in unravelling their genome architectures. For instance, the genome of F. fulva has now been assembled into 14 chromosomes, 13 of which have synteny with the 14 chromosomes of D. septosporum, suggesting these pathogens are even more closely related than originally thought. Considerable advances have also been made in the identification and functional characterization of virulence factors (e.g., effector proteins and secondary metabolites) from these pathogens, thereby providing new insights into how they promote host colonization or activate plant defence responses. For example, it has now been established that effector proteins from both F. fulva and D. septosporum interact with cell-surface immune receptors and co-receptors to activate the plant immune system. Progress has also been made in understanding how F. fulva and D. septosporum have evolved with their host plants, whilst intensive research into pandemics of Dothistroma needle blight in the Northern Hemisphere has shed light on the origins, migration, and genetic diversity of the global D. septosporum population. In this review, we specifically summarize advances made in our understanding of the F. fulva-tomato and D. septosporum-pine pathosystems over the last 10 years.

To clarify the effects of different ionic radii, this study investigated and compared the microstructures, crystal structures, phase transition behaviors, and electrical properties of BNT-ST-based ternary ceramics by modifying BiMeO3 (where Me = Al and Fe). It was observed that the stabilized relaxor states are different between BiFeO3-/and BiAlO3-modified BNT-ST ternary ceramics. As a result, it is suggested that phase transition (more precisely, the stabilization of ergodicity) can be influenced by the different internal strain in BNT-ST-based ternary ceramics.

In plants, root architecture is regulated by the distribution and intercellular flow of the phytohormone auxin. In this study, we identified ROS as an important modulator of auxin distribution and response in the root. ROS production is necessary for root growth, proper tissue patterning, cell growth, and lateral root (LR) induction. Alterations in ROS balance led to altered auxin distribution and response in SOD and RHD2 loss-of-function mutants. Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with additional sources of ROS (hydrogen peroxide) or an ROS production inhibitor (diphenylene iodonium) induced phenocopies of the mutants studied. Simultaneous application of auxin and ROS increased LR primordia induction, and PIN-FORMED protein immunolocalization further demonstrated the existing link between auxin and ROS in orchestrating cell division and auxin flux during root development. In Arabidopsis roots, genetic alterations in ROS balance led to defective auxin distribution and growth-related responses in roots. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide alters the establishment of the endogenous auxin gradient in the root meristem through regulation of PIN-FORMED polarity, while the simultaneous application of hydrogen peroxide and auxin enhanced LR induction in a dose- and position-dependent manner through activation of cell division.

Interactions between bacterial membrane-bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, the synthesis of a B-antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B-Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof is reported to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto-N-tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B-determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B-determinant in the Bleb7-conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6-conjugate.

Curvature in Biological Systems: Its Quantification, Emergence, and Implications across the Scales	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Review; Early Access						biological systems; mechanotransduction; morphogenesis; surface curvature	COLLECTIVE CELL-MIGRATION; BUTTERFLY WING SCALES; MEMBRANE CURVATURE; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; PATTERN-FORMATION; NEOTISSUE GROWTH; CUBIC MEMBRANES; SOFT MATERIALS; TISSUE-GROWTH; GEOMETRY	Surface curvature both emerges from, and influences the behavior of, living objects at length scales ranging from cell membranes to single cells to tissues and organs. The relevance of surface curvature in biology is supported by numerous experimental and theoretical investigations in recent years. In this review, first, a brief introduction to the key ideas of surface curvature in the context of biological systems is given and the challenges that arise when measuring surface curvature are discussed. Giving an overview of the emergence of curvature in biological systems, its significance at different length scales becomes apparent. On the other hand, summarizing current findings also shows that both single cells and entire cell sheets, tissues or organisms respond to curvature by modulating their shape and their migration behavior. Finally, the interplay between the distribution of morphogens or micro-organisms and the emergence of curvature across length scales is addressed with examples demonstrating these key mechanistic principles of morphogenesis. Overall, this review highlights that curved interfaces are not merely a passive by-product of the chemical, biological, and mechanical processes but that curvature acts also as a signal that co-determines these processes.

Leaf anatomical traits are known to influence g(m), but the potential effects of O-3-induced changes in leaf anatomy on g(m) have not yet been clarified. Here, two poplar clones were exposed to elevated O-3. The effects of O-3 on the photosynthetic capacity and anatomical characteristics were assessed to investigate the leaf anatomical properties that potentially affect g(m). We also conducted global meta-analysis to explore the general response patterns of g(m) and leaf anatomy to O-3 exposure. We found that the O-3-induced reduction in g(m) was critical in limiting leaf photosynthesis. Changes in liquid-phase conductance rather than gas-phase conductance drive the decline in g(m) under elevated O-3,O- and this effect was associated with thicker cell walls and smaller chloroplast sizes. The effects of O-3 on palisade and spongy mesophyll cell traits and their contributions to g(m) were highly genotype-dependent. Our results suggest that, while anatomical adjustments under elevated O-3 may contribute to defense against O-3 stress, they also cause declines in g(m) and photosynthesis. These results provide the first evidence of anatomical constraints on g(m) under elevated O-3.

However, it remains a grand challenge to achieve color and shape change behaviors on demand for emulating complicated activities of living creatures adjusting to surrounding environments. Herein, photo-responsive bilayer actuators synergic fluorescence and shape change behaviors are fabricated based on silica carbon dots (Si-CDs) and liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). In the design, Si-CDs/polydimethylsiloxane composite film acting as a photochromic layer provides tunable fluorescence performance under ultraviolet while graphene/LCE composite film functioning as a photo-actuation layer affords reversible deformation under near-infrared. Thanks to stable fluorescence and photo-actuation behaviors of bilayer soft actuators, desired camouflage, and locomotion features are realized in untethered bio-inspired soft robots such as artificial flytrap and inchworm-inspired walkers by morphology engineering and driven manner manipulation. This work offers a toolbox for designing multifunctional photo-responsive soft actuators and promotes them towards untethered bio-inspired intelligent robotic devices.

Current clinically available techniques for posterior lamellar reconstruction mainly focus on reconstructing the contour of the eyelids. However, the posterior lamella not only provides structural support for the eyelid but also offers a smooth mucosal surface to facilitate globe movement and secrete lipids to maintain ocular surface homeostasis. Bioengineered posterior lamellar substitutes developed via acellular or cellular approaches have shown promise as alternatives to current therapies and encouraging outcomes in animal studies and clinical conditions.

Here, a series of polar molecules with permanent dipole moments are designed to modify the perovskite surface termination. It is observed that proper interfacial design can significantly reduce trap state density for effective charge transfer. The energy level of the substrate can be adjusted by the magnitude and direction of the dipole moment. As a result, a high 24.54% photo-electric conversion efficiency is reached by introducing pentafluoride benzene moieties with carboxylic functional groups. In addition, the humidity and heat stability of the perovskite device is obviously improved. This work demonstrates the importance of chemical interactions at perovskite termination and paves the way for further enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells.

The simulation results indicate that increases of 36.4% in the Young's modulus, 23.6% in the bulk modulus, and 37.3% in the shear modulus of the PTFE matrix are achieved respectively by the incorporation of h-BN nanosheets. Decreases of 3.48% and 10.27% in the Poisson's ratio and the ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus of the PTFE matrix are also observed due to the incorporation of h-BN nanosheets, which shows that the ductility of the PTFE matrix could be somewhat decreased with the addition of h-BN nanosheets. Additionally, decreases of 69.23% and 69.06% in the coefficient of friction and friction stress of the PTFE matrix are obtained respectively with the introduction of h-BN nanosheets. To provide in-depth insight into the internal reason for these findings, the interaction energy between the PTFE matrix and h-BN nanosheets, the MSD and diffusion coefficient of PTFE chains, and the RDF of carbon and fluorine atoms in the PTFE backbone chains were evaluated and interpreted accordingly.

Herein, InVO4 nanosheets have been employed as a support for the lateral epitaxial growth of ZnIn2S4 nanosheets to produce hierarchical InVO4@ZnIn2S4 (InVZ) heterojunctions. The distinct branching heterostructure facilitates active site exposure and mass transfer, further boosting the participation of ZnIn2S4 and InVO4 for proton reduction and water oxidation, respectively. The unique Z-scheme modulated charge transfer, visualized by simulation and in situ analysis, has been proved to promote the spatial separation of photoexcited charges and strengthen the anti-photocorrosion capability of InVZ. The optimized InVZ heterojunction presents improved OWS (153.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for H-2 and 76.9 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for O-2) and competitive H-2 production (21090 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). Even after 20 times (100 h) of cycle experiment, it still holds more than 88% OWS activity and a complete structure.

The interest in these ingredients has shifted toward their biological activities with benefits to human health. Bioactive peptides are known as antioxidant agents that could promote health-promoting effects and prolong food shelf-life beyond their basic nutritional value. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate antioxidant, antimicrobial, and in vitro cytotoxic properties of corn pollen protein (CPP) hydrolysates obtained by different enzymes. Proteolytic activity in terms of degree of hydrolysis (DH) and SDS-PAGE analysis was measured in pancreatin (H-Pan), pepsin (H-Pep), and trypsin (H-Tri) hydrolysates. Amino acid composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and cytotoxicity of hydrolysates were evaluated. DH and SDS-PAGE revealed higher proteolytic activity of pepsin compared to other enzymes. Amino acid analysis showed that the functional amino acids such as antioxidant types were most predominant in H-Pep compared to two other samples. Antioxidant activity of hydrolysates was found to be affected by the type of enzyme and the concentration of hydrolysates. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between antioxidant activity of different hydrolysates. The highest antioxidant activity in terms of Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (0.23-2.75 mM), DPPH (33.3%-64.8%), and hydroxyl (33.7%-63.2%) radical scavenging activities, chelation of iron (33.2%-62.5%) and copper (30.2%-50.5%) metals, and total antioxidant activity (0.65-0.85) was obtained for H-Pep followed by H-Pan and H-Tri samples. Antibacterial tests showed that pepsin-hydrolyzed protein was not significantly (P > 0.05) effective against E. coli at any concentrations, however, it showed significant (P < 0.05) concentration-dependent effect against S. aureus (with inhibition zones of 15-25 mm). Cytotoxicity results revealed that CPP, as a nonhydrolyzed protein, did not generally show antiproliferative activity, however, a significant (P < 0.05) ability of H-Pep hydrolysate in decreasing HT-29 colon cancer cell line viability was seen in a concentration-dependent manner (the lowest cell viability of 32% at 5 mg/mL). Overall, investigating the application of protein-based hydrolysates is one of the possible strategies that govern their applied intentions as preservatives and nutraceuticals in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

A recently developed dilutional method allows routinary measurement of ABV and, by a simple algorithm, may turn blood volume monitor (BVM) guided UF (ultrafiltration) biofeedback into an ABV control, automatically adjusting UF rate to maintain ABV above a preset threshold. The aim of this study is to identify an individual critical ABV threshold and test the ability of an ABV feedback control to avoid IDH. MethodsWe studied 24 patients throughout three consecutive midweek HD treatments. ABV and blood pressure (BP) were measured every 30 min and anytime the patient referred any symptoms to identify each patient's critical ABV (ABV at the time of hypotension). A fixed bolus dilution approach at the start of HD was used to calculate ABV. Then, patients were followed through three additional HD treatments and IDH development was analyzed. FindingsSeventy-one treatments performed in 24 patients. ABV monitoring showed a constant decrease as HD treatment progressed. Thirteen IDH events were observed in eight different patients, with a mean systolic BP drop in IDH treatments of 37.38 +/- 4.31 mmHg and a mean adjusted ABV at hypotension of 71.07 +/- 14.88 mL/kg. Critical ABV was individually set in patients prone to IDH. As expected, ABV feedback control successfully maintained ABV over preset critical ABV. IDH events were avoided in 21 out of 22 treatments performed. ABV drop was successfully reduced, as well as SBP drop (despite similar UF than prior to ABV feedback control implementation). DiscussionABV feedback control avoided IDH in 21 out of 22 treatments performed by maintaining blood volume above critical ABV, significantly reducing ABV variations without compromising prescribed UF.

The changes alter the abundance and distribution of fishes, with potential consequences for ecosystem structure and function. Behavioural responses often underlie these changes in population dynamics, such as altered habitat choice or foraging activity. Here, we present a framework for understanding how and why behaviour is affected by human activities and how the behavioural responses in turn influence higher ecological levels. We further review the literature to assess the present state of the field and identify gaps in our knowledge. We begin with discussing the factors that determine how an individual responds to a change in the environment and whether the response is adaptive or not. In particular, we explain the importance of the evolutionary history of the species. We then search the literature to assess our current knowledge of the impact of human disturbances on the behaviour of fishes and the consequences for ecosystems. The search reveals that much attention has been directed to the impact of human activities on the behaviour of fishes, but that worryingly little is known about the consequences of these responses for populations, communities and ecosystems. Yet, behavioural responses can have profound ecological consequences given that behaviour underly many, if not most, species interactions. Thus, more attention should be paid to the mechanisms and pathways through which behavioural responses influence higher ecological levels. Such information is needed if we are to determine the ultimate effects of human activities on biodiversity and the function and stability of aquatic ecosystems.

J	Cao, CH; Zhao, YB				Cao, Chenghu; Zhao, Yongbo			The improved constant false alarm rate detector based on multi-frame integration for fluctuating target detection in heavy-tailed clutter	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							TRACK-BEFORE-DETECT; CFAR DETECTOR; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; STRATEGIES	In this paper, attention is devoted to the analysis of the detection threshold based on the multi-frame integration in heavy-tailed clutter for the radar with high resolution and even smaller grazing angle. The closed-form expressions of both the probability of the detection and the probability of false alarm for the heavy-tailed clutter background, which can be used for the theoretical analysis of constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detectors, are derived with the multi-frame integration technique. Accordingly, an improved CFAR detector is designed to work well with the presence of target-like outliers in the heavy-tailed clutter. In addition, the proposed CFAR detector is capable to alleviate the masking-effect resorting to the additive feedback operation when a target is large enough to cross several cells in multi-target case. The theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CFAR detector based on multi-frame integration can improve the signal-to-clutter rate of the targets exhibiting better performance than ones based on single frame in heavy-tailed clutter background. It is validated from the simulations that the proposed CFAR detector with additive feedback operation can deal with masking-effect for large target occupying several cells.

Diets high in non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) have been linked to insulin resistance and laminitis in horses. Nutrigenomic studies analyzing the interaction of diets high in NSCs and gene expression regulating endogenous microRNAs (miRNA) are rare. This study's objectives were to determine whether miRNAs from dietary corn can be detected in equine serum and muscle and its impacts on endogenous miRNA. Twelve mares were blocked by age, body condition score, and weight and assigned to a control (mixed legume grass hay diet) and a mixed legume hay diet supplemented with corn. Muscle biopsies and serum were collected on Days 0 and 28. Transcript abundances were analyzed using qRT-PCR for three plant-specific and 277 endogenous equine miRNAs. Plant miRNAs were found in serum and skeletal muscle samples with a treatment effect (p < .05) with corn-specific miRNA being higher than control in serum after feeding. Endogenous miRNAs showed 12 different (p < .05) miRNAs in equine serum after corn supplementation, six (eca-mir16, -4863p, -4865p, -126-3p, -296, and -192) previously linked to obesity or metabolic disease. The results of our study indicate that dietary plant miRNAs can appear in circulation and tissues and may regulate endogenous genes.

Unlocking the electronic, optical and transport properties of semiconductor coupled quantum dots using first principles methods	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY			English	Article						band-offsets; DFT; heterostructure; nanoparticle; NEGF method; quantum dots; semiconductors	BAND OFFSETS; II-VI; HETEROSTRUCTURES; ALIGNMENT; CDS; BOWINGS; STRAIN	Semiconductor coupled quantum dots provide a unique opportunity for tuning band gaps by tailoring band offsets, making them ideal for photovoltaic and other applications. Here, we have studied stability, trends in the band gap, band offsets, and optical properties for a series of coupled quantum dots comprised of II-VI semiconductors using a hybrid functional method. We have shown how the quantum confinement and interfacial strain considerably affect the band gap and band offsets for these heterostructures at the nanoscale. We show that the trend in band offsets obtained from our first-principles electronic structure calculations agrees with that obtained from the method of average electrostatic potential. It is found that a common anion rule for band offset is followed for these heterostructures at the nanoscale. Further, the calculated optical absorption spectra for these coupled quantum dots reveal that absorption peaks lie in the ultra-violet (UV) region, whereas absorption edges are in the visible region. In addition to electronic and optical properties, we have also explored transport properties for two representative coupled quantum dots, either having common cations or common anions, which revealed asymmetric nature in current-voltage characteristics. Therefore, these semiconductor coupled quantum dots may be useful for photovoltaic, light-emitting diode, and optoelectronic devices.

The prescribed formation geometry is designed in the leader-follower formation architecture, in which each vehicle tracks its intermediary leader with preserving a desired separation. A prescribed performance control design technique is introduced to guarantee the transient and steady-state performance specifications on formation errors. Radial basis function neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate modeling uncertainties including damping terms and unmodeled dynamics. Based on an actor-critic learning strategy, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to ensure the optimality of formation control and the specified tracking accuracy simultaneously, in which actor NNs take appropriate control behaviors by interacting with the external environment, and critic NNs evaluate the control performance and generate a reinforcement signal to actor NNs for facilitating the improvement of subsequent behaviors. Stability analysis shows that the proposed optimal formation controller achieves semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of closed-loop adaptive systems with prescribed performance. Comparative simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the presented control algorithm.

Enteral formulations have progressively evolved over the last 50 years from the simple blending of hospital food thin enough to run through a feeding tube, to the development of commercial standard formulas, followed by specialized formulas with immune-modulating and disease-specific qualities, to the most recent shift to food-based or blenderized EN composed of natural, whole foods with perceived health benefits. With the vast number of enteral formulations on the market, clinicians may be overwhelmed trying to determine proven vs theoretical benefits. This review is intended to explore differences in enteral formulations, identify implications for clinical practice, and review evidenced-based clinical guidelines to assist clinicians in enteral formula selection.

Subjective norms as a mediator between exposure to online alcohol and marijuana content and offline use among adolescents	DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						adolescent; peer influence; social media; substance use	SUBSTANCE USE; SOCIAL MEDIA; PEER INFLUENCE; DRINKING; ESCALATION; BEHAVIOR	Introduction: While adolescent substance use (SU) may be viewed as normative, SU can quickly escalate leading to consequences. Social media use may increase SU risk. Despite using social media to connect with others, adolescents also view depictions of glamorised SU by both peers and influential figures. Exposure to online alcohol and marijuana content may impact subjective norms (i.e., injunctive and descriptive) ultimately leading to increased offline SU. Data from a multi-wave project was collected to assess whether subjective norms-mediated associations between exposure to alcohol and marijuana content by peers and influential figures on Instagram and Snapchat and offline SU.Methods: At Wave 1, participants were 264 adolescents (M-age = 14.91, 51% female, 86% White, 85% Hispanic/Latino/a/x).Results: Injunctive norms significantly mediated associations between exposure to alcohol content posted by peers and influential figures on Instagram and Snapchat and offline alcohol use. Injunctive norms significantly mediated associations between exposure to marijuana content posted by peers and influential figures on Instagram, and peers on Snapchat and offline marijuana use. Descriptive norms significantly mediated associations between exposure to alcohol content posted by peers on Instagram, as well as peers and influential figures on Snapchat and offline alcohol use.Discussion and Conclusion: Increased exposure to online SU content was more consistently associated with injunctive norms rather than descriptive norms. Future research should examine which social media features (e.g., the like button) contribute to increased subjective norms. Overall, findings suggest that social media may strongly convey approval of SU behaviours rather than actual use.

Evaluation of Viral Inactivation on Dry Surface by High Peak Power Microwave (HPPM) Exposure	BIOELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						coronavirus; high peak power microwave; cytopathic effect	STERILIZATION	Previous research has shown that virus infectivity can be dramatically reduced by radio frequency exposure in the gigahertz (GHz) frequency range. Given the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has caused over 1 million deaths and has had a profound global economic impact, there is a need for a noninvasive technology that can reduce the transmission of virus among humans. RF is a potential wide area-of-effect viral decontamination technology that could be used in hospital rooms where patients are expelling virus, in grocery and convenience stores where local populations mix, and in first responder settings where rapid medical response spans many potentially infected locations within hours. In this study, we used bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as a surrogate of SARS-CoV-2 and exposed it to high peak power microwave (HPPM) pulses at four narrowband frequencies: 2.8, 5.6, 8.5, and 9.3 GHz. Exposures consisted of 2 mu s pulses delivered at 500 Hz, with pulse counts varied by decades between 1 and 10,000. The peak field intensities (i.e. the instantaneous power density of each pulse) ranged between 0.6 and 6.5 MW/m(2), depending on the microwave frequency. The HPPM exposures were delivered to plastic coverslips containing BCoV dried on the surface. Hemagglutination (HA) and cytopathic effect analyses were performed 6 days after inoculation of host cells to assess viral infectivity. No change in viral infectivity was seen with increasing dose (pulse number) across the tested frequencies. Under all conditions tested, exposure did not reduce infectivity more than 1.0 log(10.) For the conditions studied, high peak power pulsed RF exposures in the 2-10 GHz range appear ineffective as a virucidal approach for hard surface decontamination.

However, the effect of MTA1 on osteoclastogenesis is unknown. Currently, the regulation of MTA1 in osteoclastogenesis was reported for the first time. MTA1 knockout cells (KO) were established by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. RAW264.7 cells with WT and KO group were stimulated independently by RANKL to differentiate into mature osteoclasts. Further, western blotting and quantitative qRT-PCR were used to explore the effect of MTA1 on the expression of osteoclast-associated genes (including CTSK, MMP9, c-Fos and NFATc1) during osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, the effects of MTA1 on the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in osteoclastogenesis was determined by 2 ', 7 ' -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining. Nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. Our results indicated that the MTA1 deletion group could differentiate into osteoclasts with larger volume and more TRAP positive. In addition, compared with WT group, KO group cells generated more actin rings. Mechanistically, the loss of MTA1 increased the expression of osteoclast-specific markers, including c-Fos, NFATc1, CTSK and MMP-9. Furthermore, the results of qRT-PCR and western blotting showed that MTA1 deficiency reduced basal Nrf2 expression and inhibited Nrf2-mediated expression of related antioxidant enzymes. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that MTA1 deficiency inhibited Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Taken together, the above increased basal and RANKL-induced intracellular ROS levels, leading to enhanced osteoclast formation.

However, the narrow band gaps of Xenes prevent their broad applications in biosensors, bioimaging and phototherapeutics. In this study, it is demonstrated that 2D germanene terminated with -H via surface chemical engineering, shows a much broadened direct band gap of 1.65 eV, which enables the material to be used as a novel inorganic photosensitizer for the photodynamic therapy of singlet oxygen. Through theoretical analysis and in vitro studies, H-germanene nanosheets demonstrate a substantially enlarged band gap and favorable biodegradability, demonstrating a substantial cancer treatment capacity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of constructing novel therapeutic photodynamic agents by surface covalent engineering for catalytic tumor therapy.

Cysteine-Selective Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Desulfurative C-C Bond Formation	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article						bioconjugation; cysteine; desulfurization; post-translational modifications; site-selective	CHEMISTRY; LIGATION; INSTALLATION; EXPANSION	The site-selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible-light-mediated reaction is described that enables the site-selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM-mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.

Although polymeric HTMs have been introduced to address these issues, maximizing efficiency and achieving green-solvent processability and thermal stability for commercialization is necessary. Here, we synthesize a novel benzodifuran (BDF)-based HTM (asy-ranPBTBDF) showing an electron-deficient state, low steric hindrance, and low planarity compared to those of a typical benzodithiophene (BDT)-based HTM (asy-ranPBTBDT). BDF properties lead to deep high occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, close pi-pi stacking, excellent solubility, and amorphous properties related to efficiency, green-solvent processability, and thermal stability. With these benefits, the asy-ranPBTBDF-based CQD-SC showed enhanced open-circuit voltage (V-OC) (0.65 V) and PCE (13.29%) compared to those of the asy-ranPBTBDT-based device (0.63 V and 12.22%) in toxic processes with chlorobenzene. The asy-ranPBTBDF-based CQD-SC showed a PCE of 12.51% in a green-solvent process with 2-methylanisole and improved thermal stability at 80 degrees C (83.8% retaining after 24 h) owing to less lateral crystallization than the asy-ranPBTBDT-based device (60.8% retaining after 24 h).

Triggered Functional Dynamics of AsLOV2 by Time-Resolved Electron Paramagnetic Resonance at High Magnetic Fields	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article; Early Access						EPR Spectroscopy; Gadolinium; Protein Structures; Tigger; Time-Resolved Spectroscopy	EPR DISTANCE MEASUREMENTS; SINGLE-MOLECULE FRET; STRUCTURAL-CHANGES; LOV2 DOMAIN; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; PROTEIN-STRUCTURE; MEMBRANE-PROTEIN; LIGHT; OXYGEN	We present time-resolved Gd-Gd electron paramagnetic resonance (TiGGER) at 240 GHz for tracking inter-residue distances during a protein's mechanical cycle in the solution state. TiGGER makes use of Gd-sTPATCN spin labels, whose favorable qualities include a spin-7/2 EPR-active center, short linker, narrow intrinsic linewidth, and virtually no anisotropy at high fields (8.6 T) when compared to nitroxide spin labels. Using TiGGER, we determined that upon light activation, the C-terminus and N-terminus of AsLOV2 separate in less than 1 s and relax back to equilibrium with a time constant of approximately 60 s. TiGGER revealed that the light-activated long-range mechanical motion is slowed in the Q513A variant of AsLOV2 and is correlated to the similarly slowed relaxation of the optically excited chromophore as described in recent literature. TiGGER has the potential to valuably complement existing methods for the study of triggered functional dynamics in proteins.

Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes are developed in this study to control the three-product DWCs. As these systems are intensely interactive and highly nonlinear, NMPC may be more suitable than the traditional PI control. The model is established based on Python and Pyomo platforms. As the original mathematical model of the column section is ill-posed, index reduction is used to avoid a high-index differential-algebraic equation (DAE) system. The well-posed index-1 system after index reduction is employed for the steady-state simulation and dynamic control in this study. Case studies with three DWC configurations to separate the mixture of ethanol (A), n-propanol (B), and n-butanol (C) show that the NMPC performs very well with small maximum deviations and short settling times. This demonstrates that the NMPC is a feasible and very effective scheme to control three-product DWCs.

The assay involves multiplex PCR amplification of six Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) loci, followed by capillary electrophoresis and data interpretation. A collection of 747 spatiotemporally diverse M. viscosa isolates from nine fish species was analysed, the majority from farmed Norwegian salmon. MLVA distributed 76% of the isolates across three major clonal complexes (CC1, CC2 and CC3), with the remaining forming minor clusters and singletons. While 90% of the salmon isolates belong to either CC1, CC2 or CC3, only 20% of the isolates recovered from other fish species do so, indicating a considerable degree of host specificity. We further highlight a series of 'clonal shifts' amongst Norwegian salmon isolates over the 35-year sampling period, with CC1 showing exclusive predominance prior to the emergence of CC2, which was later supplanted by CC3, before the recent re-emergence of CC1. Apparently, these shifts have rapidly swept the entire Norwegian coastline and conceivably, as suggested by typing of a small number of non-Norwegian isolates, the Northeast Atlantic region as a whole.

Organelles display characteristic structures and perform specialized functions related to their structures. Focusing on the Golgi apparatus, we provide an overview of recent theoretical studies to explain the mechanism of the architecture of the Golgi apparatus. These studies are classified into two categories: those that use equilibrium models to describe the robust Golgi morphology and those that use non-equilibrium models to explain the stationarity of the Golgi structures and the constant streaming of membrane traffic. A combinational model of both categories was used for computational reconstruction of the de novo Golgi formation process, which might provide an insight into the integrated understanding of the Golgi structure.

The art of the design principles of high-performance adhesives lies in the regulation of adhesion and cohesion strengths. Compared with permanent covalent bonds, dynamic bonds, including dynamic covalent and noncovalent bonds, are vulnerable under mechanical stimuli but rebuildable, making them promising candidates to manipulate the internal and interfacial energy. In this review, we mainly discuss how dynamic bonds can be applied to adhesive materials to regulate adhesion and cohesion, simultaneously. Representative samples are rationally selected to elaborate on the engineering designs for improving the adhesive performance via incorporating dynamic bonds. We also offer a perspective on future research directions on the engineered construction of advanced adhesive materials.

RESULTSAdministration of SWP, FBTP, STA or CF restored the levels of body weight, immune organ index, immune organ morphology, cytokines and immunoglobulins in CTX immunosuppressed mice. Interestingly, CF improved all the mentioned parameters more effective than administration of SWP, FBTP or STA alone. In addition, CF was more effective to increase the levels of intestinal immune-related gene expression than FBTP, SWP or STA alone in immunosuppressed mice, suggesting that CF exhibited excellent intestinal immune regulation function. CF also significantly improved cecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids of CTX-treated mice. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis demonstrated that CF recovered the levels of 28 metabolites associated with the CTX treatment to the levels of normal mice. CONCLUSIONConclusively, these findings suggested that CF as a functional food combination of SWP, FBTP and STA could promote the immune function against human diseases, which providing theoretical support for the co-ingestion of SWP and functional sugars as a feasible strategy for improving the body immunity in the future.

The index measures anti-establishment attitudes cross-nationally. Methods: Using survey data from 25 countries, we test the reliability of the system is broken index and then demonstrate its convergent and divergent validity. Results: The results reveal that the system is broken index is a reliable and valid measure capturing perceptions that the political system, in any given country, is broken and is not working for the average person. The index predicts related attitudes (nativism and populism) and provides stable estimates of anti-establishment attitudes over time. Conclusions: The system is broken index helps to predict the conditions that give rise to anti-establishment candidates and populist movements. Tracking the measure across three decades provides unique insights into the challenges confronting contemporary politics, including the rise of populism movements.

The data-driven solvers bypass the construction of a constitutive equation for the hyperelastic materials by considering a dataset of Green-Lagrange strain-second Piola-Kirchhoff stress pairs. They recast the boundary-value problems into the distance minimization problems with basic kinematical and mechanical constraints. Moreover, the deviatoric/volumetric split of stress and the additional incompressible constraint are further introduced into the solver for the nearly incompressible hyperelastic materials. Several representative three-dimensional examples are presented and the results demonstrate the good capability and robustness of the proposed data-driven solvers.

MethodsWe searched all published RCTs on SSc indexed in PubMed. We retrieved information on main features of RCTs published from 2000 onward and recorded for each study whether race/ethnicity was reported; how ethnicity/race was defined and assigned; and the number of patients included for each racial/ethnic group. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with race/ethnicity reporting. Proportion of races/ethnicities included in US-based RCTs on SSc was examined and compared with US demographic data. ResultsWe included 106 studies, mostly conducted in Europe (42%) or North America (25%), published after 2010 (74%), and enrolling a total of 6,693 patients. About one-third of studies provided information about race/ethnicity, with no improved reporting over time. Only 2 papers reported patient's socioeconomic status. Study location (US or intercontinental) was the only significant factor associated with a better reporting of race/ethnicity in multivariable analysis. In studies where race/ethnicity was reported, White patients were mostly represented (79%), followed by Asian (7%), and African American (6%). In the sensitivity analysis limited to studies from the US, underrepresentation of African American patients was observed in the 2000-2010 time period, but not later. ConclusionDocumentation of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status is poor in RCTs on SSc. More effort should be made to document race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status and to promote diversity in SSc RCTs.

Phase 1 evaluation of an elastomeric nucleus pulposus device as an option to augment disc at microdiscectomy: Experimental results from biomechanical and biocompatibility testing and first in human	JOR SPINE			English	Article						biomaterials; biomechanics	LUMBAR-DISK; REPLACEMENT; PDN; DISKECTOMY; PEPTIDES; HYDROGEL; GELATION; DESIGN	Objective Whilst microdiscectomy is an excellent reliever of pain for recalcitrant lumbar disc herniation (LDH), it has a high failure rate over time due to the ensuing reduction in mechanical stabilization and support of the spine. One option is to clear the disc and replace it with a nonhygroscopic elastomer. Here, we present the evaluation of biomechanical and biological behavior of a novel elastomeric nucleus device (Kunovus disc device [KDD]), consisting of a silicone jacket and a two-part in situ curing silicone polymer filler.Materials and Methods ISO 10993 and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards were used to evaluate the biocompatibility and mechanics of KDD. Sensitization, intracutaneous reactivity, acute systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, muscle implantation study, direct contact matrix toxicity assay, and cell growth inhibition assay were performed. Fatigue test, static compression creep testing, expulsion testing, swell testing, shock testing, and aged fatigue testing were conducted to characterize the mechanical and wear behavior of the device. Cadaveric studies to develop a surgical manual and evaluate feasibility were conducted. Finally, a first-in-human implantation was conducted to complete the proof of principle.Results The KDD demonstrated exceptional biocompatibility and biodurability. Mechanical tests showed no Barium-containing particles in fatigue test, no fracture of nucleus in static compression creep testing, no extrusion and swelling, and no material failure in shock and aged fatigue testing. Cadaver training sessions showed that KDD was deemed implantable during microdiscectomy procedures in a minimally invasive manner. Following IRB approval, the first implantation in a human showed no intraoperative vascular and neurological complications and demonstrated feasibility. This successfully completed Phase 1 development of the device.Conclusion The elastomeric nucleus device may mimic native disc behavior in mechanical tests, offering an effective way for treating LDH by way of Phase 2 and subsequent clinical trials or postmarket surveillance in the future.

Intramolecular 1,2 C-H Addition of <i>o</i>-Methyl Groups to Form Unique Ruthenium Pincer Tuck-in Complexes	CHEMCATCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						agostic interactions; ligand non-innocence; metallacycles; PNP ligands; ruthenium	CATALYTIC-HYDROGENATION; COORDINATION CHEMISTRY; PNP; ALCOHOLS; LIGANDS; DEHYDROGENATION; METHANOL; ESTERS; AMINE; IMINE	New (RPNP)-P-H ligands containing 2,4-xylyl (4mXPN(H)P) and mesityl (MesPN(H)P) groups on the phosphorus atoms were synthesized. 4mXPN(H)P reacts with [(cymene)RuCl2](2) followed by PMe3 to produce kappa(3)-4mXPN(H)PRu(PMe3)Cl-2. MesPN(H)P reacts with [(cymene)RuCl2](2) to produce monomeric kappa(3)-MesPN(H)PRuCl(2) that reacts with CO forming kappa(3)-MesPN(H)PRu(CO)Cl-2. Surprisingly, dehydrohalogenation of these complexes results in the activation of ortho methyl groups of the pincer ligands, rather than formation of kappa(3)-RPNPRuLCl complexes. This results from transient kappa(3)-RPNPRuLCl formation followed by 1,2-addition of an ortho C-H bond across the Ru-amide bond. The transient amide complex of kappa(4)-4mXPN(H)PRu(PMe3)Cl was trapped with CO forming kappa(3)-4mXPNPRu(PMe3)(CO)Cl. In contrast, kappa(4)-MesPN(H)PRu(CO)Cl does not react with ligands to trap the expected amide complex of reverse C-H addition. Instead, CO and PMe3 displace the chloride ligand forming cationic complexes. In both cases, hemi-lability of the pincer ligand was observed spectroscopically. The new complexes serve as precursors to moderately active catalysts for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of n-butanol.

Also, the commercial polyolefin separator will undergo severe thermal shrinkage when the internal temperature of the battery increases to 130-160 degrees C, which increases the risk. Therefore, the development of a high thermal stability and high-safety separator is an effective strategy to improve battery safety. Herein, we design a green, cellulose-based separator (Cel@DBDPE) with a unique encapsulation structure for lithium-ion batteries, in which functional flame retardants (DBDPE) are wrapped in microscrolls formed by the self-rolling of 2D cellulose nanosheets upon freeze-drying. This structure can firmly anchor DBDPE particles in the separator to prevent them from undergoing exfoliation and does not affect the properties of the separator, such as the thickness and the pore structure. Compared with commercial polypropylene, Cel@DBDPE has excellent thermal stability and flame retardancy. The former makes it less prone to thermal shrinkage and the latter can effectively prevent the combustion of the electrolyte, showing an efficient self-extinguishing ability. Moreover, the Cel@DBDPE is only 15 mu m in size and has competitive properties comparable to polypropylene. Thus, there is no sacrifice in the electrochemical performance of battery when the Cel@DBDPE is used as separator. This study provides a new structural design for the construction of a high-safety separator.

J	Jie, X; Zhaofeng, W; Dongdong, C; Jinsheng, C				Jie, Xi; Zhaofeng, Wang; Dongdong, Chen; Jinsheng, Chen			Study on time-space characteristics of gas drainage in advanced self-pressure-relief area of the stope	ENERGY SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						advanced self-pressure-relief zone; COMSOL simulation; drainage before mining; drainage while mining; gas drainage	PERMEABILITY EVOLUTION; COAL; OPTIMIZATION; EXTRACTION; BEHAVIOR; SEAM	Gas drainage is an important measure to ensure energy safety in coal mines. However, for mines with high gas content and low permeability, the critical question is how to enhance the drainage effect of drilling. By using the self-unloading pressure effect on the coal body in front of the mine, the permeability of the coal body can be improved, which facilitates gas drainage. Therefore, establishing the fluid-solid model of gas-bearing coal mass under the influence of mining, this paper simulates the advanced self-pressure-relief range in front of the coal working face and the permeability of coal seam at different heights. Through simulations and field tests, the reasonableness of the advanced self-pressure-relief gas drainage was verified, and the spatial and temporal characteristics of the gas drainage from the borehole were quantified and analyzed. The results show that the width of the advanced self-pressure-relief zone after simulated mining is 25 m, the vertical permeability of the coal seam increases first and then decreases with the increase of the height from the floor, and the maximum permeability of the layer is 2.6 m from the floor, which is 8.62 times higher than the initial permeability; the gas drainage effect of test boreholes has a periodic law with the coal seam recovery, which, divided into the initial drainage stage, the scalar volume of gas drainage increase stage, and the scalar volume of gas drainage decay stage. At a distance from the working face 20-40 m, the boreholes' scalar volume of gas drainage increased by 3.89 times compared with the initial drainage stage, and the scalar drainage volume of the boreholes through the seam increased by 8.01 times compared with the initial drainage stage; in the section of increasing scalar volume of drainage, the gas drainage volume of the boreholes at different heights of the coal seam had obvious "stratification" phenomenon. The test boreholes were optimally placed in the middle of the seam at the lower end. The study provides a reference for self-pressure-relief gas drainage technology and optimization of borehole placement.

Neoadjuvant pazopanib in nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (ARST1321): A report of major wound complications from the Children's Oncology Group and NRG Oncology	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						neoadjuvant; pazopanib; sarcoma; wound complications; wound healing	SURGICAL COMPLICATIONS; RADIATION-THERAPY; RADIOTHERAPY; CLASSIFICATION; PHASE; CHEMORADIATION; CHEMOTHERAPY; RESECTION; OUTCOMES; GRADE	Background and ObjectivesThe impact upon wound healing of targeted molecular therapies, when incorporated into neoadjuvant therapy of soft tissue sarcoma, is largely unknown. Here, we describe wound complications following addition of pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), to neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) +/- chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma. MethodsWound complications were evaluated on dose-finding and randomized arms of ARST1321, a phase II/III study incorporating neoadjuvant RT, +/- pazopanib, +/- ifosfamide/doxorubicin (ID) for sarcoma therapy. ResultsOf 85 evaluable patients, 35 (41%) experienced postoperative wound complications. Most (57%) were grade III. Randomization to pazopanib + RT + ID carried a 50% wound complication rate (17/34, with 47% grade III), compared to 22% (5/23) with ID + RT alone. In nonchemotherapy study arms, pazopanib + RT resulted in a 59% wound complication rate versus 25% for those receiving RT alone. Grade III wound complications occurred among 26% (15/58) of all patients receiving pazopanib. Wound complications occurred a median of 35 days postoperatively. Some occurred following diagnostic biopsies and at remote surgical sites. ConclusionThe addition of pazopanib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and RT resulted in a higher wound complication rate following therapy of soft tissue sarcoma. The rate of grade III complications remained comparable to that reported in contemporary literature.

We investigated the relationship between increased dopamine levels and mental abnormalities using bile duct ligation (BDL) rats and the mechanism by which liver failure increased dopamine levels in SH-SY5Y cells.Behavioural tests were carried out on day 13 and 27 following BDL, along with measurements of dopamine and metabolites, expressions of enzymes and transporters related to dopamine metabolism, and its transport into the cortex and the hippocampus. SH-SY5Y cells were used to investigate whether NH4Cl, bile acids and bilirubin affected expression of tyrosine hydroxylase or not. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in SH-SY5Y cells co-incubated with bilirubin and signal pathway inhibitors was measured. Key ResultsOpen-field test results demonstrated BDL rats showed anxiety-like behaviour, accompanied by increased dopamine levels and expression of TH protein in the cortex. Membrane bound long form (MB)-COMT, slightly but significantly decreased. SH-SY5Y cells indicated that increased bilirubin levels was a factor in inducing TH expression. Both inhibitor of NF-kappa B pathway BAY 11-7082 and silencing NF-kappa B p65 reversed bilirubin-induced upregulation of TH protein. NF-kappa B activator TNF-alpha increased expression of TH protein. Roles of bilirubin in increases of TH protein expressions and dopamine levels were measured using hyperbilirubinemia rats. Anxiety-like behaviour, was associated with increased dopamine levels and TH protein expressions in hyperbilirubinemia rats. Conclusion and ImplicationsBDL significantly increased dopamine levels in rat cortex partly due to bilirubin-mediated TH induction. Increased bilirubin induced TH expression via activating NF-kappa B signalling pathway.

This study aimed to develop a model with which to predict burns inpatient mortality and admission duration. MethodsMultiple logistic and linear regression were used to investigate mortality and admission duration by age, total body surface area, sex, delay to presentation, the use of surgery, discharge distance and period. ResultsOne thousand four hundred and seventy nine patients (747 pre-COVID and 732 during COVID) were admitted between the study dates. Using multiple logistic regression, age and total body surface area predicted mortality LR X-2 (5), P < 0.001, pseudo R-2 = 0.57. Using multiple linear regression, age, total body surface area and the use of surgery predicted admission duration F (7, 1455) = 161.42, P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.44. Sex, delay to presentation, period and discharge distance did not predict mortality or admission duration. ConclusionsIn our institution, mortality was increased by 8.6% for each additional year of age and by 11.3% for each additional percentage total body surface area. Likewise, admission duration was prolonged by 1 day for every 7 years of increased age, by 1 day for each additional percentage total body surface area or by 7 days if surgery was required. These models have been incorporated into a set of prediction tables for mortality and admission duration for use in our institute that can guide patient and family discussions.

Triflic acid remained unaffected by any plasma condition while >75% decomposition of formate and PFOA could be achieved. In situ hydroxyl (OH)-laser-induced fluorescence measurements near the droplets confirmed that the conversion was independent of the OH flux to the droplet. A series of control experiments suggest that the contribution of vacuum UV photons in such decomposition of aqueous compounds can be significant for He and He + 17% Ar plasmas and can also explain unexpected decomposition trends as a function of droplet residence time in the plasma.

MethodsThis multicenter observational cohort study included 4328 patients with type 2 diabetes. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of sex for ESKD and death were estimated using Cox proportional regression with adjustment for baseline covariates. For assessing risk modification, HRs and incidence rates for ESKD and death were compared between sexes across patient characteristics using Cox proportional and Poisson regression models. ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 7 years, 276 patients (70% men) developed ESKD, and 241 patients (68% men) died. Men had higher risks of ESKD (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.02-1.75; p = .034) and death (HR 1.64; 95% CI 1.24-2.16; p = .001) versus women after adjusting for multiple covariates. Among patients with microalbuminuria, men had a substantially higher risk of ESKD versus women, compared to those with normo- and macroalbuminuria (p for interaction .04). Incidence rates were also increased in men versus women with albuminuria of around 300 mg/g. No differences were detected in the association of sex and death across baseline patient subgroups. ConclusionsIn type 2 diabetes, men had an increased risk of ESKD and death versus women. Moderately increased albuminuria was strongly associated with sex difference in developing ESKD.

In this study, we investigated the impact of any amount of ST growth on tumour characteristics and patient outcomes. Furthermore, we evaluated whether ST growth per se affected patients' prognosis in the absence of aggressive features, namely vascular invasion. DesignWe analysed 222 PTC patients followed up for more than 5 years in the Department of Endocrinology of the Instituto Portugues de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil from 2002 to 2020. All PTC cases with any percentage of ST growth were included and compared with PTC without ST growth (1:2). Carcinomas with high-grade features were excluded. ResultsThere were 74 PTC cases with ST growth and 148 without ST growth (median follow-up of 9.3 years). PTC-ST was associated with larger tumour size (p = 0.001) and increased frequency of vascular invasion (p < 0.001) compared with PTC. However, PTC-ST did not exhibit a higher incidence of extrathyroidal extension (p = 1.000) or lymph node metastasis (p = 0.433). Despite the significantly higher prevalence of distant metastasis in PTC-ST compared with PTC (p = 0.043), the significance is lost when the cases with vascular invasion were excluded (p = 0.347). The total radioiodine activity was higher in PTC-ST than in PTC (p = 0.008). Recurrence rates were similar between groups (p = 0.755). The 10-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates for PTC-ST were 94.6% and 98.6%, respectively, similar to the PCT without ST growth (p = 0.097 and p = 0.333, respectively). There was no evidence of an association between the presence of an ST component (p = 0.201) with the risk of death or recurrence, whereas the presence of distant metastasis significantly increased the risk of these events (hazard ratio 10.14, p < 0.001). ConclusionsThe presence of ST growth was associated with several aggressive clinicopathological features. However, the risk of cancer recurrence and death for PTC-ST were similar to PTC. In the absence of vascular invasion, the clinical impact of ST growth alone is negligible.

Climate change and wetland configuration predict sex ratios of a freshwater species	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive capacity; agriculture; climate change; land use; landscape structure; temperature; turtle; wetland configuration	CLEMMYS-GUTTATA; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; NESTING SITES; UNITED-STATES; MOVEMENTS; REPTILE; PATTERNS; REQUIREMENTS	Climate change and land-use change are leading drivers of biodiversity decline, affecting demographic parameters that are important for population persistence. For example, scientists have speculated for decades that climate change may skew adult sex ratios in taxa that express temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), but limited evidence exists that this phenomenon is occurring in natural settings. For species that are vulnerable to anthropogenic land-use practices, differential mortality among sexes may also skew sex ratios. We sampled the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), a freshwater species with TSD, across a large portion of its geographic range (Florida to Maine), to assess the environmental factors influencing adult sex ratios. We present evidence that suggests recent climate change has potentially skewed the adult sex ratio of spotted turtles, with samples following a pattern of increased proportions of females concomitant with warming trends, but only within the warmer areas sampled. At intermediate temperatures, there was no relationship with climate, while in the cooler areas we found the opposite pattern, with samples becoming more male biased with increasing temperatures. These patterns might be explained in part by variation in relative adaptive capacity via phenotypic plasticity in nest site selection. Our findings also suggest that spotted turtles have a context-dependent and multi-scale relationship with land use. We observed a negative relationship between male proportion and the amount of crop cover (within 300 m) when wetlands were less spatially aggregated. However, when wetlands were aggregated, sex ratios remained consistent. This pattern may reflect sex-specific patterns in movement that render males more vulnerable to mortality from agricultural machinery and other threats. Our findings highlight the complexity of species' responses to both climate change and land use, and emphasize the role that landscape structure can play in shaping wildlife population demographics.

In vitro maturation of oocytes as a laboratory approach to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS): From oocyte to embryo	WIRES MECHANISMS OF DISEASE			English	Article; Early Access						in vitro maturation; ovarian stimulation; polycystic ovary syndrome	IVM; FERTILIZATION; WOMEN; DETERMINANTS; FOLLICLES; PREGNANCY; HEALTH; FUTURE	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, which in some case leads to infertility. This disorder is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. Infertile PCOS women that need in vitro fertilization (IVF) have greater risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) if conventional ovarian stimulation is used. In vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) is an alternative technique that prevents OHSS in infertile PCOS women. In the last decade, IVM protocols have improved, particularly with the development of biphasic IVM culture accounting for better pregnancy and live birth rates. This technique has been extended to other treatments like, fertility preservation, when patients have no time, or a contra-indication for ovarian stimulation, and poor responders. In this review, we will discuss IVM as a viable option for PCOS infertile patients.This article is categorized under:Reproductive System Diseases > Molecular and Cellular PhysiologyReproductive System Diseases > Environmental FactorsReproductive System Diseases > Genetics/Genomics/Epigenetics	[Rodrigues, Patricia; Marques, Monica; Manero, Juan Aibar; Marujo, Maria D.

Additionally, we designate reasonable directions for the identification of potent and probably selective LC3/GABARAP inhibitors for alternative therapeutic applications.

J	Soares, S; Gonçalves, M; Jerónimo, R; Kolinsky, R				Soares, Sara; Goncalves, Matilde; Jeronimo, Rita; Kolinsky, Regine			Narrating science: Can it benefit science learning, and how? A theoretical review	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING			English	Review; Early Access						learner features; narrative effects; science learning; science narrative texts; text comprehension	TEXT GENRE; SCIENTISTS STRUGGLES; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; ACADEMIC LANGUAGE; SEDUCTIVE DETAILS; WRITING STORIES; SCHOOL SCIENCE; COMPREHENSION; STUDENTS; EDUCATION	Narrative texts have been advocated as tools to tackle science learning challenges, and there is even the proposal of a "narrative effect " on learning. We believe it is necessary to examine previous evidence on this effect, as well as to characterize the process of learning through science narrative texts more broadly. In this article, we offer a theoretical review drawing on three frameworks, namely on pedagogical aspects of text learning, linguistic features of texts, and cognitive aspects of text comprehension. Based on that, we analyzed two complementary questions. First, we reviewed 36 studies to ask if science narrative texts can benefit learning and memory outcomes at different educational levels (i.e., the "If " question). We found encouraging evidence for the use of science narrative texts at various educational levels, especially in delayed assessments and longer-lasting interventions. Second, we gathered and linked ideas, hints, and evidence on how the process of learning with science narrative texts takes place, namely on conditions and underlying processes (i.e., the "How " question). There are many features from conditions (texts, learners, activities, wider context) and underlying processes (integration with prior knowledge, affective dispositions, and cognitive abilities) that can help to account for variability in outcomes; yet, ideas and evidence are not always tightly connected. We suggest that education and research should focus on specific narrative effects, that specify with what (texts), with whom (learners), when and where (activities and wider context) these effects occur, as well as "why " (underlying processes). We believe the proposed framing can help both make sense of previous evidence and inform future educational practices and research and provide some recommendations in this regard.

J	Tsuji, S; Kohama, T				Tsuji, Satoshi; Kohama, Teruhiko			Proximity and Tactile Sensor Combining Multiple ToF Sensors and a Self-Capacitance Proximity and Tactile Sensor	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						ToF sensor; capacitance sensor; proximity and tactile sensor; collaborative robots	SKIN SENSOR; IMPLEMENTATION	Future labor forces are anticipated to include collaborative robots that work alongside humans in the same environment. Proximity and tactile sensors are among the most important devices for collaborative robots to operate safely. In this paper, we propose a proximity and tactile sensor for a collaborative robot that combines multiple time-of-flight (ToF) sensors and a self-capacitating proximity and tactile sensor. ToF sensors can detect the distance to an object and have a long measurement range. However, at close distances, their detection accuracy deteriorates, and blind spots may likely not be detected. Conversely, the self-capacitance proximity and tactile sensor detect objects within the blind spots of ToF sensors and contact conditions because the sensor can detect an object before and after contact, being highly sensitive in the proximity range. In the proposed sensor, the electrodes of the self-capacitance are enlarged, and multiple ToF sensors are used to expand the measurement range and reduce blind spots. A prototype sensor was seamlessly able to measure objects from approximately 400 mm to contact conditions. In addition, the robot arm with the prototype sensor could be controlled in real time using the measured data of the sensor. Therefore, we believe that the proposed sensor can be potentially used as a proximity and tactile sensor for collaborative robots. (c) 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Insulin decreases epileptiform activity in rat layer 5/6 prefrontal cortex in vitro	SYNAPSE			English	Article						GABA(A) receptors; insulin; prefrontal cortex; seizure-like activity; tonic currents	GABA(A) RECEPTOR SUBUNITS; OVARIAN CYCLE; DELTA-SUBUNIT; MOUSE MODEL; SEIZURES; NMDA; HIPPOCAMPUS; ACTIVATION; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION	Accumulating evidence indicates that insulin-mediated signaling in the brain may play important roles in regulating neuronal function. Alterations to insulin signaling are associated with the development of neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Also, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have been associated with seizure activity and brain injury. In recent work, we found that insulin increased inhibitory GABA(A)-mediated tonic currents in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In this work, we used local field potential recordings and calcium imaging to investigate the effect of insulin on seizure-like activity in PFC slices. Seizure-like events (SLEs) were induced by perfusing the slices with magnesium-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the proconvulsive compound 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). We found that insulin decreased the frequency, amplitude, and duration of SLEs as well as the synchronic activity of PFC neurons evoked by 4-AP. These insulin effects were mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and mimicked by gaboxadol (THIP), a delta GABA(A) receptor agonist. The effect of insulin on the number of SLEs was partially blocked by L-655,708, an inverse agonist with high selectivity for GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha 5 subunit. Our results suggest that insulin reduces neuronal excitability by an increase of GABAergic tonic currents. The physiological relevance of these findings is discussed.

Comorbid eating, depressive, and anxiety psychopathology is associated with elevated shame in women with food insecurity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS			English	Article						anxiety; depression; EDs; food insecurity; shame	GUILT-PRONENESS; MENTAL-HEALTH; DISORDER; VALIDITY; STANDARDIZATION; INDIVIDUALS; PREDICTORS; EXPERIENCE; SYMPTOMS; GENDER	ObjectiveTo compare participants with current food insecurity and different psychopathology profiles on shame, guilt, anxiety, and depression using a cross-sectional design. MethodWomen with current food insecurity (n = 99; 54% White) were placed into four groups based on their endorsement of symptoms of psychopathology: eating disorder with depression/anxiety comorbidity (ED-C group; n = 17), depression/anxiety only (Depression/anxiety group; n = 34), eating disorder only (ED group; n = 12), and No-diagnosis group (n = 36). Groups were compared on self-report measures of shame, guilt, depression, and anxiety using analysis of covariance. ResultsThe presence of an eating disorder was associated with quadruple the risk of screening positive for comorbid depression and anxiety. The ED-C group reported elevated shame relative to the ED and No-diagnosis groups. The ED-C group reported the highest levels of anxiety, followed by the Depression/anxiety group, and the ED and No-diagnosis groups. DiscussionThe presence of an eating disorder with comorbidity among women with food insecurity is associated with heightened shame. Given shame's status as a transdiagnostic predictor of psychopathology, it may serve as a putative mechanism underlying the relationship between food insecurity and eating disorder comorbidity. Public Significance StatementWomen with food insecurity and an ED were more likely to also screen positive for depression and/or anxiety than women with food insecurity and no ED. Overlap between ED, depression, and anxiety was associated with elevated shame, a harmful, maladaptive emotion with negative psychosocial consequences.

In this study, the use of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is shown beyond the conventional practice of use in self-powered electronics, to the production of green hydrogen from renewable mechanical energy. For the first time the use of a magnetic covalent organic framework composite as positive triboelectric material for a contact-separation mode TENG (CS-TENG) in which MXene incorporated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film serves as negative triboelectric material, is demonstrated. A facile way of incorporating micropatterns on the surface of PDMS/MXene film is shown utilizing the advantages of 3D printing technology. The CS-TENG harvests energy from simple mechanical actions such as human handclapping and toe-tapping. The energy from such low-scale mechanical actions is applied for water electrolysis. Scanning electrochemical microscopy is employed to confirm the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen by the harvested electrical energy from mechanical actions. This research is expected to pave the way for producing green hydrogen anywhere, by utilizing the mechanical energy from nature such as raindrops, wind, and the movement of vehicles.

Herein, the first example of NIR-II-absorbing small organic molecule (N1) derived from perylene monoamide (PMI) and its bio-application after nano-encapsulation of N1 to function as a nano-agent for phototheranostics of deep orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) is reported. By adopting a dual modification strategy of introducing a donor-acceptor unit and extending pi-conjugation, the obtained N1 can absorb in 1000-1400 nm region and exhibit high photothermal conversation due to the apparent intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). A choline analogue, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine, capable of interacting specifically with receptors on the surface of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is used to fabricate the amphiphilic copolymer for the nano-encapsulation of N1. The obtained nanoparticles demonstrate efficient BBB-crossing due to the receptor-mediated transcytosis as well as the small nanoparticle size of approximately 26 nm. The prepared nanoparticles exhibit excellent photoacoustic imaging and significant growth inhibition of deep orthotopic GBM. The current study demonstrates the enormous potential of PMI-based NIR-II PTAs and provides an efficient phototheranostic paradigm for deep orthotopic GBM.

Incident SSc patients with no history of HF were identified, and non-SSc comparison groups were selected and matched to the SSc groups by age, sex, and cohort entry time. The cumulative HF incidence was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for HF hospitalization. ResultsA total of 1,830 SSc patients and 27,981 controls were identified. The cumulative incidence of hospitalized HF at 3, 5, and 10 years among patients with SSc were 3.5%, 5.3%, and 9.7%, respectively. Compared with non-SSc individuals, SSc patients had an increased risk of HF (adjusted HR 3.26 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.49-4.28]). Subgroup analyses revealed that the impact of SSc on the occurrence of HF was greater among patients ages <50 years than those ages >= 50 years (HR 7.8 [95% CI 4.03-15.1] versus HR 2.78 [95% CI 2.06-3.76]). ConclusionSSc is associated with a markedly higher risk of clinically evident HF and not asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction alone. These findings provide real-world evidence suggesting the use of appropriate screening strategies to detect these lethal complications early in SSc.

This study examined racial and ethnic differences in sickle cell disease prevalence, comorbidities, and outcomes.Methods: Using the National Inpatient Sample database from 2016 to 2018, we identified patients' records with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. The overall study population was further stratified by race into Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics. Using logistic regression, comorbidities and outcomes among sickle cell disease patients were compared between the three races/ethnicities.Results: Of the 74 817 hospitalized for sickle cell disease, 69 889 (93.4%) were Blacks, 3603 (4.8%) were Hispanics, and 1325 (1.8%) were Whites. Compared to Whites, Blacks were more likely to have significantly higher odds of sickle cell crisis (odds ratio [OR]: 3.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.66-4.14) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.37-2.02). There was no difference in mortality between Blacks and Whites. Compared to Hispanics, Blacks had significantly higher odds of sickle cell crisis (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.19-1.53) and blindness (OR: 2.94; 95% CI: 1.22-7.11), lower odds of asplenia (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.45-0.71) and gallstones (OR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58-0.95). However, Blacks had statistically significantly lower odds of mortality of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38-0.93) than Hispanics.Conclusion: Prevalent sickle cell type, severity, complications, and comorbidities vary in different races. Physicians need to be aware of these differences to manage sickle cell patients efficiently. This study hopes to inform further research regarding the reasons for varying disease characteristics among racial groups and bridge a gap in tailored management protocols.

Radial Alignment of Carbon Nanotubes via Dead-End Filtration	SMALL			English	Article						1D crystals; hot-embossing; membranes; optical limiters; polarizers; terahertz spectroscopy; thin films	THIN-FILMS; SINGLE; BIREFRINGENCE; ARRAYS	Dead-end filtration is a facile method to globally align single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in large area films with a 2D order parameter, S-2D, approaching unity. Uniaxial alignment has been achieved using pristine and hot-embossed membranes but more sophisticated geometries have yet to be investigated. In this work, three different patterns with radial symmetry and an area of 3.8 cm(2) are created. Two of these patterns are replicated by the filtered SWCNTs and S-2D values of approximate to 0.85 are obtained. Each of the radially aligned SWCNT films is characterized by scanning cross-polarized microscopy in reflectance and laser imaging in transmittance with linear, radial, and azimuthal polarized light fields. The former is used to define a novel indicator akin to the 2D order parameter using Malu's law, yielding 0.82 for the respective film. The films are then transferred to a flexible printed circuit board and terminal two-probe electrical measurements are conducted to explore the potential of those new alignment geometries.

Despite their promise, the challenges associated with their operational stability have drawn increasing attention over the past decade. Owing to their unique structure and fascinating properties such as high charge mobility, excellent conductivity, tunable bandgap, good optical transparency, and optimal surface functionalization, nanostructured materials, in particular monoelemental 2D materials, have recently been demonstrated to play versatile functions in suppressing the degradation of PSCs and enhancing the PV performance of the devices. In this review, recent advances in perovskite solar cells employing monoelemental 2D materials are presented. A brief overview of perovskite light absorbers based PV devices is first introduced, followed by critical discussions on the use of various elemental 2D materials including graphene, phosphorene, antimonene, borophene, bismuthene, and their derivatives for different components of the perovskite solar cells. Finally, the challenges in this cutting-edge research area are highlighted, and the authors express their own perspectives on addressing these key issues.

Postharvest commercial quality improvement of broccoli (<i>Brassica oleracea</i> L.) after foliar biofortification with selenium	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							SENESCENCE; ANTIOXIDANT; STORAGE; TEMPERATURE; EXPRESSION; SELENATE; GLUCOSINOLATE; ACCUMULATION; SPECIATION; ETHYLENE	Broccoli heads (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica Plenck) are one of the most valuable vegetable crops parts due to their high nutritional content. Nevertheless, they are quickly decomposed during postharvest, with the consequent loss of commercial quality. Several postharvest treatments have been analyzed to delay this process, but the influence of preharvest treatments has been little studied. Previously, we have examined the effect of foliar application of sodium selenate and selenite (50 and 100 g ha(-1)) on selenium accumulation and commercial quality of broccoli at harvest time. Here, we analyze the effect of these preharvest treatments on postharvest shelf-life of broccoli grown under field and pot conditions, in "Belstar" and "Legend" cultivars. Examination of the external appearance of the heads, quantified by Hue and L parameters, showed a marked delay in yellowing in treated samples compared to controls. In addition, selenium treatments mostly maintained the firmness and diameter of the heads. Similar results were obtained for both growing conditions and cultivars. Noticeably, the nutritional composition of broccoli heads was maintained or even improved after several foliar treatments with selenium compared with the control ones. Finally, the same analysis was performed in broccoli heads stored at low temperature, also showing different parameters improvement in the selenium-treated groups compared to control. So, we can conclude that foliar selenium treatment, besides being an overcoming strategy to obtain selenium-enriched broccoli, also contributes to improving the quality of heads during postharvest.

However, the strong electrostatic interaction between Al3+ and host lattice leads to discontented cycling life and inferior rate capability. Herein, a new strategy of employing water molecules contained VOPO4 center dot H2O to boost Al3+ migration via the charge shielding effect of water is reported. It is revealed that VOPO4 center dot H2O with water lubrication effect and smaller steric hindrance owns high capacity and fast Al3+ diffusion, while the loss of unstable water upon cycling leads to a rapid performance degradation. To address this problem, ultrathin VOPO4 center dot H2O@MXene nanosheets are fabricated via the formed Ti-O-V bond between VOPO4 center dot H2O and MXene. The MXene aided exfoliation results in enhanced V-O-water bond strength between H2O and VOPO4 that endows the obtained composite with strong water holding ability, contributing to the extraordinary cycling stability. Consequently, the VOPO4 center dot H2O@MXene delivers a high discharge potential of 1.8 V and maintains discharge capacities of 410 and 374.8 mAh g(-1) after 420 and 2000 cycles at the current densities of 0.5 and 1.0 A g(-1), respectively. This work provides a new understanding of water-contained AIBs cathodes and vital guidance for developing high-performance AIBs.

A Bayesian change point modeling approach to identify local temperature changes related to urbanization	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian model selection; climate change; DIC; urban heat islands	URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; RECORDS; TRENDS	Changes to the environment surrounding a temperature measuring station can cause local changes to the recorded temperature that deviate from regional temperature behavior. This phenomenon-often caused by construction or urbanization-occurs at a local level. If these local changes are assumed to represent regional or global processes it can have significant impacts on historical data analyses. These changes or deviations are generally gradual, but can be abrupt, and arise as construction or other environmental changes occur near a recording station. We propose a methodology to examine if changes in temperature behavior at a point in time exist at a local level at various locations in a region assuming that regional or global processes are correlated among nearby stations. Specifically, we propose a Bayesian change point model for spatio-temporally dependent data where we select the number of change points at each location using a "forward" selection process using deviance information criterion. We then fit the selected version of the model and examine the linear slopes across time to quantify the local changes in long-term temperature behavior. We show the utility of this model and method using both synthetic data and observed temperature measurements from eight stations in Utah consisting of daily temperature data for 60 years.

Changes in trabecular architecture, which can be detected with non-destructive high-resolution CT imaging, may reveal OA progression before apparent articular surface damage. Here, we analysed the tibial epiphyses of STR/Ort (OA-prone) and CBA (healthy, parental control) mice at different ages to characterise the effects of mouse age and strain on multiple bony parameters. We isolated epiphyseal components using a semi-automated method, and measured the total epiphyseal volume; cortical bone, trabecular bone and marrow space volumes; mean trabecular and cortical bone thicknesses; trabecular volume relative to cortical volume; trabecular volume relative to epiphyseal interior (trabecular BV/TV); and the trabecular degree of anisotropy. Using two-way ANOVA (significance level <= 0.05), we confirmed that all of these parameters change significantly with age, and that the two strains were significantly different in cortical and trabecular bone volumes, and trabecular degree of anisotropy. STR/Ort mice had higher cortical and trabecular volumes and a lower degree of anisotropy. As the two mouse strains reflect markedly divergent OA predispositions, these parameters have potential as bioimaging markers to monitor OA susceptibility and progression. Additionally, significant age/strain interaction effects were identified for total epiphyseal volume, marrow space volume and trabecular BV/TV. These interactions confirm that the two mouse strains have different epiphyseal growth patterns throughout life, some of which emerge prior to OA onset. Our findings not only propose valuable imaging biomarkers of OA, but also provide insight into ageing 3D epiphyseal architecture bone profiles and skeletal biology underlying the onset and development of age-related OA in STR/Ort mice.

In many of these regions, rice is the predominant staple food. Here, we present a validated maximum allowable concentration of total As in paddy soil and provide the first derivation of a maximum allowable soil concentration for bioavailable As. We have previously used meta-analysis to predict the maximum allowable total As in soil based on decision tree (DT) and logistic regression (LR) models. The models were defined using the maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) of As in rice grains as per the codex recommendation. In the present study, we validated these models using three test data sets derived from purposely collected field data. The DT model performed better than the LR in terms of accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Therefore, the DT estimated maximum allowable total As in paddy soil of 14 mg kg(-1) could confidently be used as an appropriate guideline value. We further used the purposely collected field data to predict the concentration of bioavailable As in the paddy soil with the help of random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and LR models. The category of grain As (MTC) was considered as the dependent variable; bioavailable As (BAs), total As (TAs), pH, organic carbon (OC), available phosphorus (AvP), and available iron (AvFe) were the predictor variables. LR performed better than RF and GBM in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, precision, log loss, F1score, and MCC. From the better-performing LR model, bioavailable As (BAs), TAs, AvFe, and OC were significant variables for grain As. From the partial dependence plots (PDP) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) of the LR model, 5.70 mg kg(-1) was estimated to be the limit for BAs in soil.

The THz devices for practical use should operate at room temperature, be small in size, and have high output power. Therefore, this study was focused on gallium nitride (GaN), which possesses excellent material properties, such as wide bandgap characteristics and heteroepitaxy on Si substrates. The GaN-based oscillators and receivers are expected to be compact, operate at room-temperature, and act as a high-power device for the THz-band devices. However, GaN has crystal defects, which can cause instability in device operations. A double dielectric structure patch antenna composed of Silicon Nitride (SiN) and Benzo Cyclo Butene (BCB) with different dielectric constants was proposed to realize a GaN-based THz transmitter and receiver. The antenna characteristics were investigated using the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method. The results showed that the SiN has little effect on the radiation, whereas the BCB is strongly responsible for the radiation. Comparing the absolute gain between the double dielectric structure and the conventional structure using the SiN, it was confirmed that the double dielectric structure can improve the absolute gain.

Herein, a dual-functional carbon nanotube/hygroscopic salt (DFCNT/HS) film with effective passive cooling performance and fire insulation for the safe usage of practical LIBs under extremely fast discharging conditions is reported. The DFCNT/HS film based on the cooling mechanism of self-adaptive moisture absorption/desorption delivers a high cooling power of 32.9 W m(-2) K-1, which can reduce the maximum temperature of a 18650-3.6 V/2.0 Ah LIB by 11.2 and 17.4 degrees C at discharging rates of 10 and 15 C, respectively. Covering the cooling film, the battery discharges 23.6 Ah more total capacity at 10 within 500 cycles. What is challenging, almost three-fold extended lifetime of 425 cycles is achieved at 15 C with an extra total capacity of 467.2 Ah. Meanwhile, the developed film also shows an excellent high-temperature resistance up to 540 degrees C, which can alleviate the devastating fire propagation. The fast heat dissipation and excellent fire insulation as well as the mechanical flexibility and manufacturing scalability make this new material promising for safe usage of high-rate LIBs with zero energy consumption.

Flue gas desulphurization gypsum (FGDG) is commonly used for reclaiming of saline soils due to its high efficiency and cost-effectiveness. However, the responses of soil and root-associated fungi after FGDG amendment and the keystone fungal taxa in determining soil reclamation effect remain elusive. In this study, a long-term field experiment was conducted to explore the effect of different levels of one-time FGDG application on the soil reclamation and the herbage (Leymus chinensis) growth. Our results showed that the FGDG application greatly reduced soil salinity level, increased soil fertility and fungal diversity, and promoted aboveground biomass of L. chinensis, whereas reduced FGDG dose to 60% of gypsum requirement (GR) exhibited non-significant difference on these characters compared with 100% GR treatment. We further discovered that both soil and root fungal communities were greatly changed after FGDG application, with root fungal community more sensitive than soil fungi. Through applying the Random Forest model, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomeromycota was identified as the keystone taxa in predicting the soil salinity, soil fertility, and plant growth trait. Intriguingly, some Glomeromycota-affiliated ZOTUs were consistently enriched in the FGDG application treatments, and acted as keystone hubs in the co-occurrence network of fungal communities. Together, our study provides new insights that the enrichment of keystone Glomeromycota after FGDG application determines the reclamation of the saline-sodic soil, which would guide the microbial-based strategy for the development of degraded ecosystems.

Hair follicles express vitamin D receptors. Therefore, vitamin D3 may be promising for AA treatment through immunomodulatory mechanisms. The efficacy of bimatoprost in scalp AA treatment was reported by few studies. ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of microneedling (MN) with topical vitamin D3 versus MN with bimatoprost in comparison with MN alone in the treatment of localized AA. Patients and MethodsSeventy-five patients with localized AA were divided into three groups. The first group: 25 patients were treated with MN alone. The second group: 25 patients treated with MN combined with topical vitamin D3. The third group: 25 patients treated with MN combined with bimatoprost solution. The response was evaluated clinically and dermoscopically. ResultsAt the end of the study, all groups showed a statistically significant decrease in the SALT score compared to the baseline. The clinical response (regrowth scale): vitamin D and bimatoprost groups showed a statistically significant higher regrowth scale compared to MN alone group (p-value = 0.000). After treatment, hair regrowth was significantly higher in MN combined with bimatoprost than in MN combined with topical vitamin D3. However, after 3 months of follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference between both groups. Side effects were mild and transient in all groups. ConclusionTopical vitamin D3 and bimatoprost combined with MN are safe and effective therapeutic options for localized AA.	[Ali, Mona S. S.; Hafiz, Hala S. A.; Ahmed, Naglaa A.

By introducing "monofunctional impurity" or "stoichiometric imbalance," this methodology can afford well-defined end-functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non-activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring-opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.

Information sharing to support care transitions for patients with complex mental health and social needs	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article						care transitions; information sharing; serious mental illness; skilled nursing facility	SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES; HOSPITAL READMISSIONS; ILLNESS; PERSPECTIVES; EXCHANGE; OUTCOMES; QUALITY; ADULTS	Background Patients with complex behavioral and mental health conditions require significant transitional care coordination. It is unclear how skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) that serve these patients engage in care transfer with hospitals, specifically whether they experience discrepancies in the type of information shared by hospital partners and/or use different approaches to secure needed information.Methods Cross-sectional analysis of a national 2019-2020 SNF survey that collected information on transitional care practices with referring hospitals; respondents were directors of nursing services. We used chi-squared tests and descriptive statistics to characterize hospital information sharing practices experienced by facilities that accept complex patients (e.g., serious mental illness, substance use disorder, and/or medication assisted treatment), and to compare them to facilities that treat a less complex population.Results A total of 215 SNFs had sufficiently complete responses for inclusion in the analysis. Of these respondents, 57% accepted two or more types of patients with complex conditions of interest; these SNFs were more likely to be urban, for-profit, and serve more dual-eligible patients. SNFs accepting complex patients experience information sharing on par with other facilities, and are more likely to receive information on behavioral, social, mental, and functional status (25.41% vs. 12.90%; p = 0.023). These facilities are also more likely to consistently use electronic methods (e.g., an online portal, shared electronic health record [EHR] access) to retrieve information from partner hospitals.Conclusions SNFs accepting complex patients demonstrate some evidence of enhanced information retrieval via electronically mediated pathways. Overall, information sharing remains underdeveloped in this care context. Policymakers should continue to prioritize widespread digital infrastructure that supports post-acute care delivery.

On the other hand, since grit-containing cleansers (GC) show a higher washing power that minimizes washing time, their usage is generally preferred in specific occupational fields.Objectives: To compare whether a shorter, intense washing period might cause less skin damage than a longer washing period with an MC.Methods: Differences in cleaning time were first verified in a pilot study using standardized model dirt. In the main study, the forearms of 35 healthy volunteers were washed with three standardized procedures over a period of 3 days, either using 2 min of MC with/without hand brush or 1-min GC. Clinical scoring, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), corneometry, colourimetry and scaliness/roughness (Visioscan) were used to evaluate the epidermal barrier, topography and irritation.Results: The pre-study showed that washing time doubled when using MC vs. GC. Using GC resulted in stronger barrier disruption, even after a shorter washing period - median delta T4-T1 TEWL 0.96 g/m(2)/h vs. 4.91 g/m(2)/h respectively, p < 0.0001. The most harmful procedure for the skin was the additional application of a hand brush (18.86 g/m(2)/h).Conclusions: Short-time washing with GC damages the skin barrier more significantly in comparison to a longer application of an MC. When washing with MC, the strongest irritant reaction occurred when accompanied with hand brushing.

The detection of the virus with high sensitivity and accuracy holds great importance. Nowadays, the most commonly employed technique is the Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction test (qRT-PCR) and antigen test. While RT-PCR technique is time consuming, expensive and labour intensive, antigen tests though simple, can often give false positive and false negatives. In this context, electrochemical biosensors developed in recent times have been identified as a potential strategy to overcome the limitations of these common techniques. This review article summarizes the current advancements in the field of voltammetric sensors for the detection of COVID-19 virus and various biomarkers associated with it.

Material and methodsThree-unit frameworks supported by two implants were additively manufactured (Atlantis; Dentsply Sirona) using Ti and Co-Cr dental alloys. Two implants (OsseoSpeed EV, Astra Tech; Dentsply Sirona) were torqued on each non-engaging framework. The assembled implant-frameworks were secured into polyurethane foam blocks. Groups were created based on the material and surface assessed: framework (Ti-framework and Co-Cr-framework groups) and implant (Ti-implant group). Two subgroups were created depending on the location: premolar (PM) and molar (M). Computed tomography images were obtained pre- (as manufactured) and post-simulated mastication procedures. The pre- and post-simulated mastication files of each specimen were aligned using the best-fit algorithm using a metrology program. Wear was measured by calculating the volumetric discrepancies at the implant interface on 64 measurement points per area analyzed. Three-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were used to analyze the data (alpha = 0.05). ResultsThe mean volumetric discrepancy values ranged from 0.8 to 3.1 mu m among all the subgroups tested. The group (framework vs. implant) (p < 0.001) and tooth location (p < 0.001) were significant factors of the mean volumetric discrepancy values obtained. The framework group presented with significantly lower volumetric discrepancy mean values (1 mu m) compared with the implant group (3 mu m), whereas the premolar area obtained significantly lower mean volumetric discrepancy values (1.9 mu m) compared with the molar location (2.3 mu m). ConclusionsVolumetric discrepancies were found at the implant-framework interface tested between the pre- and post-artificial aging measurements ranging from 1 to 3 mu m after 1,200,000 cyclic loading that simulated approximately 12 months of function.

Our model network is comprised of Potts units, which represent patches of cortex, interacting through long-range connections. The critical assumption is that a memory, for example of a spatial view, is composed of a limited number of items, each of which has a pre-established representation: storing a new memory only involves acquiring the connections, if novel, among the participating items. The model is shown to have a much lower storage capacity than when it stores simple unitary representations. It is also shown that an input from the hippocampus facilitates associative retrieval. When it is absent, it is advantageous to cue rare rather than frequent items. The implications of these results for emerging trends in empirical research are discussed.

However, the HALP score in hepatocellular carcinoma has not been reported. MethodsData were analyzed retrospectively from Child-Pugh A patients undergoing hepatic resection for single hepatocellular carcinoma <= 5 cm. For cross-validation, patients were divided into the training (332 patients) and validation cohort (210 patients). In the training cohort, we divided patients into two groups by appropriate cut-off value of the HALP score, and univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted for disease-free and overall survival (OS) between two groups. In the validation cohort, we examined OS by Kaplan-Meier analysis in the same cut-off value of the HALP score in the training cohort. ResultsThe HALP-low group was significantly older (p = 0.0003), had fewer hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients (p = 0.0369), higher prothrombin time (p = 0.0141), lower fibrosis-4 index (p = 0.0206), bigger maximum tumor size (p = 0.0196), and less histological liver fibrosis (p = 0.0077). Multivariate analysis showed that the independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival were fibrosis-4 index >= 2.67 (p = 0.0008), simple nodular type with extranodular growth or confluent multinodular type (p = 0.0221), and intrahepatic metastasis (p = 0.0233), and that for OS were fibrosis-4 index >= 2.67 (p = 0.0020), HALP <= 45.6 (p = 0.0228), and poor differentiation (p = 0.0305). In the validation cohort, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed the trend toward significantly impaired OS (p = 0.0220) in the HALP-low group. ConclusionWe showed that a low HALP score is the independent prognostic factor for Child-Pugh A patients undergoing curative hepatic resection for single and small hepatocellular carcinoma.

The complex formation of EDTA with Zn and cyanide (CN-) with Zn surface and morphology of the DMC catalyst were confirmed by PXRD, FTIR, SEM, and UV-Vis. Furthermore, the C-13-CP MAS spectroscopy showed an integral ratio of 3.2 : 1 for the bound and free carboxyl group of EDTA in the catalyst, respectively. The maximum yield (>98 %) of PPG with turnover frequency (TOF) of 9625 h(-1) was obtained with controlled PDI (1.1) in only 1 h with 1330 g mol(-1) M-w, 0.009 meq g(-1) unsaturation number, and 8.1 mg-KOH g(-1) OH value at optimized reaction condition (Catalyst amount=0.015 g, Time=1 h, Temperature=105 degrees C, Pressure=5 bar, PO : PEG-600=40 : 1). The ROP showed first-order kinetics behavior by H-1 NMR spectroscopy with proposed coordination mechanism.

The inference of drug sensitivities for individual cells can provide new insights to understand the mechanism of anti-cancer response heterogeneity and drug resistance at the cellular resolution. However, pharmacogenomic information related to their corresponding scRNA-Seq is often limited. Therefore, a transfer learning model is proposed to infer the drug sensitivities at single-cell level. This framework learns bulk transcriptome profiles and pharmacogenomics information from population cell lines in a large public dataset and transfers the knowledge to infer drug efficacy of individual cells. The results suggest that it is suitable to learn knowledge from pre-clinical cell lines to infer pre-existing cell subpopulations with different drug sensitivities prior to drug exposure. In addition, the model offers a new perspective on drug combinations. It is observed that drug-resistant subpopulation can be sensitive to other drugs (e.g., a subset of JHU006 is Vorinostat-resistant while Gefitinib-sensitive); such finding corroborates the previously reported drug combination (Gefitinib + Vorinostat) strategy in several cancer types. The identified drug sensitivity biomarkers reveal insights into the tumor heterogeneity and treatment at cellular resolution.

However, engineering a nanoplatform that integrates with efficient biocatalytic ROS generation, ultrasound-amplified ROS production, and simultaneous relief of tumor hypoxia is still a great challenge. Here, we create new semiconducting titanate-supported Ru clusterzymes (RuNC/BTO) for ultrasound-amplified biocatalytic tumor nanotherapies. The morphology and chemical/electronic structure analysis prove that the biocatalyst consists of Ru nanoclusters that are tightly stabilized by Ru-O coordination on BaTiO3. The peroxidase (POD)- and halogenperoxidase-like biocatalysis reveals that the RuNC/BTO can produce abundant center dot O-2(-) radicals. Notably, the RuNC/BTO exhibits the highest turnover number (63.29 x 10(-3) s(-1)) among the state-of-the-art POD-mimics. Moreover, the catalase-like activity of the RuNC/BTO facilitates the decomposition of H2O2 to produce O-2 for relieving the hypoxia of the tumor and amplifying the ROS level via ultrasound irradiation. Finally, the systematic cellular and animal experiments have validated that the multi-modal strategy presents superior tumor cell-killing effects and suppression abilities. We believe that this work will offer an effective clusterzyme that can adapt to the tumor microenvironment-specific catalytic therapy and also provide a new pathway for engineering high-performance ROS production materials across broad therapeutics and biomedical fields.

The underlying molecular defects affecting mitochondrial CIII assembly factors are few and yet to be identified. LYRM7 assembly factor is required for proper CIII assembly where it acts as a chaperone for the Rieske iron-sulfur (UQCRFS1) protein in the mitochondrial matrix and stabilizing it. We present here the seventeenth individual with LYRM7-associated mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy harboring a previously reported rare pathogenic homozygous LYRM 7 variant, c.2T>C, (p.Met1?). Like previously reported individuals, our 5-year-old male proband presented with recurrent metabolic and lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, and fatigue. Further, he has additional, previously unreported features, including an acute stroke like episode with bilateral central blindness and optic neuropathy, recurrent hyperglycemia and hypertension associated with metabolic crisis. However, he has no signs of psychomotor regression. He has been stable clinically with residual left-sided reduced visual acuity and amblyopia, and no more metabolic crises for 2-year-period while on the mitochondrial cocktail. Although the reported brain MRI findings in other affected individuals are homogenous, it is slightly different in our index, revealing evidence of bilateral almost symmetric multifocal periventricular T2 hyperintensities with hyperintensities of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and corona radiata but with no cavitation or cystic changes. This report describes new clinical and radiological findings of LYRM7-associated disease. The report also summarizes the clinical and molecular data of previously reported individuals describing the full phenotypic spectrum.

The support program included a short lecture and three moral case delibera-tion sessions for nurses working in an acute care hospital. The Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) and the Euro-MCD (Moral Case Deliberation) 2.0 scale were used for pre/post-comparison, using the Wilcoxons signed-rank test. Furthermore, post-intervention interviews were conducted with consenting participants to determine the reasons for changes in pre/post-intervention quantitative data. Of the 34 participants, 29 completed the post-questionnaire and were included in the quantitative data analysis, and 27 were included in the qualitative data analysis.Results: The mean MMD-HP total scores increased from 147.5 +/- 61.0 to 159.3 +/- 66.7, but not significantly (p = .375). The mean score of moral compe-tence, a sub-scale of the Euro-MCD 2.0, increased significantly from 15.4 +/- 2.4 to 16.4 +/- 2.8 after the intervention (p = .036). A qualitative analysis revealed increased moral sensitivity to ethically difficult situations and improved ana-lytical skills as the reasons for change in scores pre/post-intervention.Conclusion: The results of the qualitative analysis suggested the effectiveness of the intervention. The moral distress score increased, although not signifi-cantly, and moral competence also increased, suggesting the participants' values changed after the intervention. It was found that the support program using MCD is expected to improve participants' moral competence.

MethodsPubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched for RCTs reporting targeted therapies in patients with PsO/PsA published until 28 October 2021. The primary and secondary outcomes included the relationship between targeted therapies and all cardiovascular events (CVEs), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and stroke in PsO/PsA. The outcome risk ratios (RRs) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. ResultsA total of 81 articles involving 88 RCTs were included. There was no statistically significant difference regarding the occurrence of all CVEs for all targeted therapies (RR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.74-1.43, P = .85) compared to placebo in PsO/PsA. No statistically significant difference existed between drugs and placebo in patients with PsA on all CVEs (RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.48-1.36, P = .43). Surprisingly, the incidence of all CVEs was higher in the low dosage group compared to the high dosage group of all targeted therapies (RR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.19-3.27, P = .008) and prominently anti-interleukin-17 agent (RR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.05-4.58, P = .04). ConclusionCurrent targeted therapies are not associated with the risk of CVEs. Based on the existing evidence, we reported here that a dosage reduction of targeted therapies was not recommended.

We show that if natural capital is scarce enough, a WTR increases the long-term levels of the hourly wage and employment. A numerical analysis of the transitory impacts of a WTR confirms that when natural capital is scarcer, a WTR increases employment more and the hourly wage less, with a less negative initial impact on output.

The study uses a critical race perspective to help understand contextual influences on school climate. Data were collected through eight focus group interviews comprised of students conducted in middle and high schools in a large Midwest urban school district. Themes emerged within each school climate domain: teacher support, teacher expectations, safety, and peer social and emotional competence. The study results describe how students experience and understand school climate-perception of safety in schools with a mix of safe and unsafe home-community climate-and demonstrate how students acknowledge the relationship between school climate and academic achievement. Urban secondary students are observant of the social-emotional learning of their peers and maintain awareness of group differences as expressed in their counter-stories. The findings advanced our understanding of school climate in urban contexts where social-contextual-struggles experienced by people of color affect their school experiences. The discussion includes practical implications for educators and administrators and directions for future research.

Despite political efforts to achieve policy coherence, apparent trade-offs and goal conflicts have emerged - even in a proclaimed 'front-runner' country like Sweden. This paper examines the role of ideas in proposing and legitimising policy options and achieving policy coherence in the light of the Swedish recovery debate in 2020 following the COVID-19 pandemic. Ideas of a green economic recovery put forward in the public debate are examined through thematic text and frame analysis. We show that ideas of a green transition, boosted by economic recovery spending, draw on a synergistic frame in combining social, environmental, and economic policy options, carrying a potential for coherency. However, the absence of a discussion on power, as in who stands to gain what under which circumstances, coupled with an inherent understanding of a temporal hierarchy of policy priorities does not only impact the ability to design coherent policies but may have considerable impacts on the prospects of achieving sustainability transformations.

This unprecedented control over the spatial terahertz light distribution can profoundly impact multiple terahertz applications such as signal multiplexing, imaging, and displays. This work demonstrates this multi-degree-of-freedom control in structures fabricated through 3D printing employing low-loss materials. The designs are validated through 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and experimental measurements, showing that, in all cases, the desired diffraction patterns are generated.

The grain size modifications have been achieved by a series of thermal and thermo-mechanical processing. The potentiodynamic polarization study has revealed that the coarse-grained specimens exhibit higher corrosion and pitting resistance than the fine-grained ones. This has been attributed to the greater extent of random high-angle grain boundary (RHAGB) surface area in the fine-grained specimens, which acted as favorable locations for pit initiation. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) result has indicated the formation of more imperfect (nonstoichiometric) passive layers in fine-grained specimens due to the predominant presence of high energy and defective RHAGBs surface. Moreover, the Mott-Schottky analysis has revealed that the fine-grained specimens generate higher defect densities at the interfaces, which leads to passive film instability due to increased mobility of cation interstitial and cation vacancies at the interfaces.

Their prevalence and impact in India is high, in terms of total numbers of people affected. Due to diverse climate and lifestyle, the Indian population is exposed to a rich and varied range of aerobiological particles. In the last two decades in India, 83 pollens, 34 fungi, six dust mite and 19 insect species were reported as allergenic, often contributing to heavy allergenic exposure in indoor and outdoor environments. There are currently few practitioners who offer allergy diagnosis and treatment in India, but there is active basic and molecular research aiming to improve the health of allergic patients. This review explores the field of aero-allergy in India during the last two decades, with special emphasis on prevalence across various centres and relevant scientific advances such as genetic associations and new therapeutics. This review will be helpful for clinicians to select aero-allergens for sensitisation testing in patients suffering from symptoms in different regions of India, and to support patients undertaking prophylaxis of allergic symptoms in India according to local environmental conditions. This study also helps to define patient selection for allergy testing and the role of test results in guiding allergic disease management in the Indian context. Finally, we summarize genetic findings relevant to aero-allergy in India and discuss the development of novel therapeutics for investigation and management of aero-allergy in India.

Thus, it may be hypothesized that the phytochemicals of C. pectinata seed could modulate testicular steroidogenesis. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of C. Pectinata seed extract (CPE) on testicular steroidogenesis by using in vivo and in vitro approaches. We have also performed the molecular docking of phytochemicals with some steroidogenic markers based on the identified phytochemicals from our previous study. The in vivo treatment of CPE increased the circulating estrogen and decreased circulating testosterone. The in vitro treatment of CPE also showed increased secretion of estrogen which can be suggested due to an increase in the aromatase (CYP19A1) activity. Our results also showed that the expression and localization of CYP19A1 were elevated by the CPE. The treatment of CPE also showed an accumulation of cholesterol in the testis, which could enhance testicular steroidogenesis. The other steroidogenic markers like 3 beta HSD, StAR, and LHR were upregulated by the CPE. Twelve compounds exhibited binding energy in the range of -10.0 to -8.0 kcal/mol with CYP19A1. Our data from in vitro, in vivo, and docking studies, showed that phytochemicals of CPE could modulate testicular steroidogenesis.

A series of novel nickel(II) complexes of the type [Ni(L)(CH3CN)(2)](BPh4)(2) 1-5, where L=N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N ', N '-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine (L1), N,N-dimethyl-N '-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)-N '-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl) propane-1,3-diamine (L2), N,N-bis((4-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyridin-2-ylmethyl)-N ',N '-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine (L3), N-(2-(dimethylamino) benzyl)-N ',N '-dimethyl-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl) propane-1,3-diamine (L4) and N,N-bis(2-(dimethylamino)benzyl)-N ', N '-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine (L5) have been synthesized and characterized as the catalysts for the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into organic cyclic carbonates. The single-crystal X-ray structure of 2 was determined and exhibited distorted octahedral coordination geometry with cis-alpha configuration. The complexes have been used as a catalyst for converting CO2 and epoxides into five-membered cyclic carbonates under 1 atmospheric (atm) pressure at room temperature in the presence of Bu4NBr. The catalyst containing electron-releasing -Me and -OMe groups afforded the maximum yield of cyclic carbonates, 34% (TON, 680) under 1 atm air. It was drastically enhanced to 89% (TON, 1780) under pure CO2 gas at 1 atm. It is the highest catalytic efficiency known for CO2 fixation using nickel-based catalysts at room temperature and 1 atm pressure. The electronic and steric factors of the ligands strongly influence the catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, all the catalysts can convert a wide range of epoxides (ten examples) into corresponding cyclic carbonate with excellent selectivity (>99%) under this mild condition.

C.; Durner, Wolfgang			Rock fragments influence the water retention and hydraulic conductivity of soils	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							SIMPLIFIED EVAPORATION METHOD; SIMPLE CONSISTENT MODELS; STONY-SOILS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES	Rock fragments (RFs) influence soil hydraulic properties (SHPs), and knowledge about the SHPs of stony soils is important in vadose zone hydrology. However, experimental evidence on effective SHPs of stony soils is still scarce and mostly restricted to water-saturated conditions and low volumetric contents of RFs. We examined the influence of RFs on SHPs through a series of measurements. Stony soils were prepared by packing 250-cm(3) cylinders with soils of two textures (sandy loam and silt loam) and with different volumes of RFs (up to 50% v/v) with a diameter of 8-16 mm. Samples were prepared in a way that the background soils (diameter smaller than 2 mm) had identical bulk density. The simplified evaporation method was used to determine the effective SHPs of stony soils. We used the obtained SHP data to evaluate the performance of models, which predict the effective SHPs of stony soils from SHPs of the background soil. The results highlight the systematic dependency of SHPs on volumetric content of RFs. The difference between modeled and measured SHPs was substantial for cases in which the soil contained a high amount of RFs. Accounting for the moisture content of RFs improved the prediction of the effective water retention curve of stony soils compared with a simple scaling that used only the content of RFs. Among the evaluated models for the effective hydraulic conductivity, the model based on the general effective medium theory showed the best performance, particularly for low RF contents.

However, most studies have only focused on one of these potential drivers and we know little about the relative importance of the different mechanisms (changes in nutrient availability, in plant diversity or functional composition or in consumer abundance) by which nitrogen enrichment affects soil functioning. In addition, soil functions could vary dramatically between seasons; however, they are typically measured only once during the peak growing season. We therefore know little about the drivers of intra-annual stability in soil functioning.In this study, we measured activities of beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase, two extracellular enzymes that indicate soil functioning. We did so in a large grassland experiment which tested the effects, and relative importance, of nitrogen enrichment, plant functional composition and diversity, and foliar pathogen presence (controlled by fungicide) on soil functioning. We measured the activity of the two enzymes across seasons and years to assess the stability and temporal dynamics of soil functioning.Overall beta-glucosidase activity was slightly increased by nitrogen enrichment over time but did not respond to the other experimental treatments. Conversely, plant functional diversity and interactions between plant attributes and fungicide application were important drivers of mean acid phosphatase activity. The temporal stability of both soil enzymes was differently affected by two facets of plant diversity: species richness increased temporal stability and functional diversity decreased it; however, these effects were dampened when nitrogen and fungicide were added.The fungicide effects on soil enzyme activities suggest that foliar pathogens can also affect below-ground processes and the interacting effect of fungicide and plant diversity suggests that these plant enemies can modulate the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. The contrasting effects of our treatments on the mean versus stability of soil enzyme activities clearly show the need to consider temporal dynamics in below-ground processes, to better understand the responses of soil microbes to environmental changes such as nutrient enrichment.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial organelle in lipid metabolism and ER stress is closely correlated with lipid metabolism dysfunction. The aim of this study is to elucidate whether the inhibition of ER stress could alleviate hypoxia-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) lipolysis and liver lipid accumulation-mediated hepatic injury. A rat model of high-altitude hypoxia (5500 m) was established using hypobaric chamber. The response of ER stress and lipolysis-related pathways were analyzed in WAT under hypoxia exposure with or without 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA) treatment. Liver lipid accumulation, liver injury, and apoptosis were evaluated. Hypoxia evoked significant ER stress in WAT, evidenced by increased GRP78, CHOP, and phosphorylation of IRE1 alpha, PERK. Moreover, Lipolysis in perirenal WAT significantly increased under hypoxia, accompanied with increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin. Treatment with 4-PBA, inhibitor of ER stress, effectively attenuated hypoxia-induced lipolysis via cAMP-PKA-HSL/perilipin pathway. In addition, 4-PBA treatment significantly inhibited the increase in fatty acid transporters (CD36, FABP1, FABP4) and ameliorated liver FFA accumulation. 4-PBA treatment significantly attenuated liver injury and apoptosis, which is likely resulting from decreased liver lipid accumulation. Our results highlight the importance of ER stress in hypoxia-induced WAT lipolysis and liver lipid accumulation.

The early pioneer species relied on root-fungal symbiosis, developing densely branched roots with high mycorrhizal colonisation rates for foraging mobile soil nitrate. The late pioneer species invested in roots themselves and allocated effort towards improving uptake efficiency of less-mobile ammonium. Within the root economics space, the covariation of axes with soil phosphorus availability also distinguished the strategy preference of the two successional groups.These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating physiological uptake efficiency into root economics space, and reveal a trade-off between expanding soil physical space exploration and improving physiological uptake efficiency for successional species coexistence in forests.

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalisation, and the secondary outcomes were cardiogenic shock, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrioventricular block and new stroke.Results: The mean age of participants was 65 years and 78.6% were male. Of the 2412 patients, all-cause mortality occurred in 236 patients (9.8%) during hospitalisation. In multivariate-adjusted models that corrected for variable weights, the risk of all-cause mortality increased with an increase in random glucose levels at admission; specifically, the risk of all-cause mortality increased per 1 mg/dL (odds ratio [OR] 1.006, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.004-1.008), per 9 mg/dL (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.08), and per 18 mg/dL (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.16) increases in admission glucose levels. When admission glucose levels were expressed as a categorical variable, increased levels of glucose (relative to the reference glucose value < 140 mg/dL) led to an increased risk of all-cause mortality; specifically, the OR of all-cause mortality for 140-200 mg/dL glucose was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.09-2.17) and the OR for glucose > 200 mg/dL was 3.08 (95% CI: 2.00-4.62) (P for trend < 0.001). The risk of cardiogenic shock also increased with glucose levels with an OR of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.21-2.31) for 140-200 mg/dL glucose and an OR of 3.72 (95% CI: 2.50-5.46) for > 200 mg/dL, compared with that of glucose < 140 mg/dL. In multivariate-adjusted spline regression models, an increased risk of all-cause mortality was observed in patients with glucose >= 122 mg/dL (OR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.38- 2.38, p < 0.001) compared with the reference cohort. Furthermore, patients with glucose >= 111 mg/dL (OR: 2.36, 95% CI: 1.80-3.12) had a higher risk of cardiogenic shock than patients with glucose < 111 mg/dL.Conclusions: Patients with AMI and without diabetes who had elevated random glucose levels at admission had a higher risk of all-cause mortality and cardiogenic shock during hospitalisation. In particular, patients with glucose >= 122 mg/dL had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, and those with glucose >= 111 mg/dL had an increased risk of cardiogenic shock.

Herein, the mm-wave microstrip patch antenna (MPA) and its multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration based on the metasurfaces for 5G system applications are proposed and investigated by the simulation method. To improve performance and keep the low-profile and low-cost MPA antenna, square ring resonator (SQRR) metasurface and radiating patch are printed on a single dielectric layer. With the presence of the metasurfaces that acting as a secondary radiator, the performance of the designed antenna is significantly improved with a wide operating band in the range of 23.9-30.7 GHz, high peak gain of 9.4 dBic, and radiation efficiency of above 87%. Based on this design, four-port MIMO antenna configuration is performed for evaluating a MIMO system that realizes the advantage features such as compact size, wide bandwidth covering the entire global mm-wave 5G spectrum band of 24.25-29.5 GHz, and excellent diversity performance characterized by good isolation between the adjacent elements and low envelope correlation coefficient. Thus, the MIMO antenna design is a very promising candidate for 5G MIMO mm-wave applications, specifically in cellular systems.

Redesigning the appearance of recycled containers for packaging applications: The effect of paper waste physicochemical properties on the performance of paperboards with obvious recycled content	PACKAGING TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE			English	Article						cationic starch; cellulose microfibrils; mixed office waste; multi-ply paperboards; packaging appearance; PLA paper cups; recycled packaging	NANOFIBRILLATED CELLULOSE; ECO-LABELS; PULP; STRENGTH; PRODUCTS; STARCH; OCC	Significant efforts have been made over the past decade to facilitate the recognition of environmentally friendly packaging and promote sustainability. Yet, consumers remain confused by the excess of labels and claims used to communicate sustainability. In our previous work, we modified the appearance of recycled fibre-based packaging by incorporating visible particles of fibre-based waste. This strategy enabled consumers to better identify packages with a high recyclability level, enhancing their environmental perception towards sustainable products. However, the incorporation of such large waste particles proved to be detrimental to the mechanical properties of the paperboards. In this study, we further investigate the influence of the physicochemical properties of the added fibre-based waste on packaging performance. Using a similar strategy to enhance the environmental perception, we herein studied the effect of mixed office waste (MOW), old magazines (OMG), and polylactic acid (PLA) paper cups. The presence of hydrophobic and difficult-to-process and difficult-to-disperse waste, such as the PLA paper cups, significantly altered the mechanical performance of the paperboards, whereas more hydrophilic and easy-to-disintegrate waste (MOW and OMG) had a lesser effect regardless of the size of the particles. Strength agents such as cationic starch (CS) and cellulose microfibrils (CMFs) successfully restored the properties of the paperboards containing MOW and OMG but were less effective for PLA paper cups. A multi-ply strategy overcame the limitations of CS and CMFs using the redesigned paperboard as an outer ply for aesthetic purposes and a 100% recycled inner ply for restoring strength.

To meet the needs of efficient, secure, concealed and stable transmission of confidential information, the transaction data structure of Bitcoin and the location and capacity of potential covert channels are analysed. The data transmission model for covert storage channels based on Bitcoin blockchain is also proposed.

Although the DfE collects data relating to the demographics of all teachers, the 2022 SEND Review Green Paper does not draw on this to support or inform the changes being proposed. A Freedom of Information request was made to the DfE, from which actual data could be acquired, with breakdowns by age, gender, qualifications and leadership status. The data describe a teacher who is still more likely to be female and approaching the middle of their career. Most SENCos are still on the class teacher pay scale rather than the leadership scale, with a minority holding a Master's-level qualification. The DfE does not have an accurate overview of how many teachers hold the current SENCo qualification. The article provides a number of recommendations to policymakers based on the data provided.

In this work, we investigated HTL with 4.5 g of Chlorella and 45 ml of water/ethanol (1:1 vol. ratio) in a 100 ml reactor. Bio-oils produced are characterized via elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). HTL of Chlorella was investigated at 240 and 250? for 0 and 15 min under an air or H-2 atmosphere and with and without 5% zeolite Y. Temperature increased the bio-oil yield from 38.75% at 240? to 43.04% at 250? for 15 min reaction time. Longer reaction time increased the bio-oil yield at 250? from 39.14% for 0 min to 43.04% for 15 min. The H-2 atmosphere had a significant effect for HTL at 240?. Zeolite Y increased the bio-oil yield significantly from 32.03% to 43.06% at 250? for 0 min. The carbon content of bio-oil increased with the temperature while the oxygen content decreased. The boiling point distribution of bio-oils in the range of 110-300? varies with temperature, and atmosphere. At 240? for 15 min, the 110-300? range increased from 31.19% in air (240-15-air) to 39.25% in H-2 (240-15-H-2). The H-2 atmosphere increased the content of hydrocarbons, alcohols, and esters from 69.61% in air (240-0-air) to 82.83% in H-2 (240-0-H-2). Overall, temperature, reaction time, atmosphere, and catalyst all significantly influenced the yield and/or quality of bio-oils from HTL of Chlorella.	[Haque, Tarek Md.

Structural equation modeling was used to examine the mediating effects of workplace social capital on the relationship between nurse managers' authentic leadership and the three dimensions of organizational commitment.Results Six hundred and fifty-nine data points were analyzed (valid response rate = 54.0%). Participants' average age was 28.6 years (standard deviation: 6.6), and 93.3% were female. The mediation indirect effect of workplace social capital between authentic leadership and organizational commitment was statistically significant in the models of affective organizational commitment and normative organizational commitment, but not in the model of continuance organizational commitment.Conclusions The effects of authentic leadership and workplace social capital had different impacts on each of the three dimensions of organizational commitment. Nurse managers' authentic leadership and workplace social capital can enhance nurses' positive commitment to the organization.

High-throughput capillary electrophoresis analysis of biopharmaceuticals utilizing sequential injections	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article; Early Access						capillary electrophoresis; charge variants; high-throughput; monoclonal antibodies; sequential injections	MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; QUALITY ATTRIBUTES	The complexity of biotherapeutic products implies an ever-increasing list of product quality attributes that need to be monitored and characterized. In addition, the growing interest in implementing process analytical technology in biopharmaceutical production has further increased the testing burden, together with the need for rapid testing that can facilitate real-time or near-real-time decision-making. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has made a place in biopharmaceutical analysis but is regarded as a low-throughput method, with the instrument dead time constituting more than 80% of the total time of analysis. In this study, the dead time of CE was utilized to analyse 3 mAb samples in a single-CE run. This approach resulted in an up to 77% reduction in the total analysis time and increased the productivity by up to 300%, compared to traditional single CE-ultraviolet runs, without compromising resolution or relative peak areas. Additionally, good method reproducibility was observed. The compatibility of the method has been demonstrated with protein A eluate and cation exchange chromatography fractions. We, thus, propose that sequential injections can be applied for fast and robust CE analysis of biopharmaceuticals.	[Kumar, Ramesh; Sarin, Deepika; Rathore, Anurag S.

Testing the context dependence of ant nutrient preference across habitat strata and trophic levels in Neotropical biomes	ECOLOGY			English	Article						foraging activity; foraging behavior; habitat strata; niche partitioning; nutritional ecology; trophic ecology	ELAIOSOMES; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; SODIUM	Animals are integrated into the wider ecosystem via their foraging and behavior. The compensation hypothesis predicts that animals target their foraging efforts (i) toward nutrients that are scarce in the environment and (ii) toward nutrients that are not present in the usual diet of species, which varies across trophic levels. Understanding how foraging for resources varies locally, such as across habitat strata, and trophic levels will help to elucidate the links between the local environment and communities to the ecological functions that animals mediate. We examined whether the relative resource use of ants varies consistently along a habitat strata gradient and across trophic levels across Neotropical biomes. We placed 4500 baited tubes, each containing one of five liquid resources (sugar, amino acid, lipid, sodium, and distilled water) in one of three habitat strata (subterranean, epigaeic, and arboreal) across 60 transects in Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal biomes. We assessed the relative resource use of all ants across the habitat strata and among two different trophic groups across biomes. The relative preference for sugar increased from subterranean to arboreal strata in all biomes, while the relative preference for lipids decreased at this gradient in five biomes. We also found that in general sugar-consuming ants foraged more for sugar and less for lipids than predatory ants across biomes. Conversely, we found no consistency across biomes in nutrient preference of amino acid and sodium across habitat strata or trophic levels. Overall, our results indicate sugar limitation in the arboreal stratum and lipid limitation on the ground across biomes and that the trophic level of ants strongly determines their foraging efforts-possibly because ants try to fix their dietary nutrient imbalances. Hence, our findings suggest strong local niche partitioning of sugar and lipid use across habitat strata and trophic levels and that other large spatial scale processes influence the local amino acid and sodium dynamics.

Controlling nanosheet size and reducing its potential toxicity are key issues in the photothermal therapy of tumors. Herein, a multifunctional nanoplatform based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is developed using a green solvent with antitumor activity, ionic liquid (IL) exfoliation, and surface modification to prepare a few layers of IL-MoS2 nanosheets, with a lateral dimension of approximate to 96 nm and thickness of 4 nm. The PEG-b-PIL polymer improves the biocompatibility, physiological stability, and biodegradability of the nanosheet, and IL-MoS2-PEG-b-PIL exhibits good photothermal stability and photothermal effects. The in vitro and in vivo results show that IL-MoS2-PEG-b-PIL nanosheets synergistically inhibit tumor cell growth in combination with photothermal therapy and chemotherapy under 808 nm laser irradiation. The steady increase in the weight of mice during the treatment indicates that the nanosheets are safe. Therefore, the results confirm that IL-MoS2-PEG-b-PIL nanosheets exhibit good antitumor effects and provide a promising strategy for clinical cancer treatments.

Meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials comparing incretin-based glucose-lowering medications and basal insulin: An update including recently developed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide	DIABETES OBESITY & METABOLISM			English	Article						body weight; fasting plasma glucose; GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonists; basal insulin; GLP-1 receptor agonists; glycaemic control; HbA(1c); type 2 diabetes	OPEN-LABEL; WEEKLY EXENATIDE; GLYCEMIC CONTROL; TYPE-2; GLARGINE; SAFETY; METFORMIN; EFFICACY; PREVALENCE; OUTCOMES	Objective: To assess comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of injectable incretin-based glucose-lowering medications (IBGLMs) versus basal insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Research Design and Methods: We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of head-to-head comparisons of IBGLMs (short- and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide) versus basal insulin using a PubMed database search (April 2022). The primary endpoint was difference in reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) versus baseline between pooled IBGLMs (fixed-effects meta-analysis) and their subgroups (random-effects meta-analysis) versus basal insulin treatment (mean differences). Secondary endpoints were fasting plasma glucose, body weight, HbA(1c) target achievement, hypoglycaemia, blood pressure and lipids. Risk of bias assessment was performed using Jadad scores and the Risk of Bias tool 2.0. Results: In all, 20 studies, representing 47 study arms and 11 843 patients, were eligible. Compared with basal insulin, IGBLMs lowered HbA(1c) by 0.48 (0.45-0.52)% more than did basal insulin treatment. This effect was driven by pooled long-acting GLP-1RAs (Delta HbA(1c) -0.25 [-0.38; -0.11]%) and the only GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, tirzepatide (pooled doses; Delta HbA(1c) -0.90 [-1.06; -0.75]%), while short-acting GLP-1RAs were equally effective compared with basal insulin (P = 0.90). All IBGLM subgroups achieved significantly lower body weight versus insulin treatment (-4.6 [-4.7; -4.4] kg), in particular tirzepatide (-12.0 [-13.8; -10.1] kg). IBGLMs significantly reduced hypoglycaemia and blood pressure and improved lipid variables. Risk of bias was low. IBGLM treatment was associated with more nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and study medication discontinuation. Conclusions: Recently introduced, highly effective IBGLMs were superior to basal insulin treatment, reinforcing the recommendation that IBGLMs should be considered as the first injectable treatment for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

But in hyper-diverse systems, which often display high species richness and low species abundance, these sorts of community comparisons are especially challenging. The classic view for Amazonian birds posits that riverine barriers and habitat specialization determine local and regional community composition. We test the tacit, complementary assumption that similar bird communities should therefore permeate uniform habitat between major rivers, regardless of distance. Location: Upland (terra firme) rainforests of central Amazonia. Methods: We conducted intensive whole-community surveys of birds in three pairs of 100-ha plots, separated by 40-60 km. We then used dissimilarity indices, cluster analysis, and ordination to characterize differences among the six avian communities. Results: In all, we detected 244 forest-dependent birds, with an average of 190 species (78%) per plot. Species turnover was negligible, no unique indicator species were found among plot pairs, and all documented species were already known from a complete inventory at one of the three sites. Main Conclusions: Our study corroborates the classic biogeographical pattern and suggests that turnover contributes little to regional avian diversity within upland forests. Using a grain size of 100 ha, this implies that upland birds perceive the environment as uniform, at least over distances of similar to 60 km. Therefore, to maximize both local species richness and population persistence, our findings support the conservation of very large tracts of upland rainforest. Our analyses also revealed that the avifauna at Reserva Ducke, encroached by urban sprawl from the city of Manaus, shows the hallmarks of a disturbed community, with fewer vulnerable insectivores. This defaunation signals that even an enormous preserve (10 x 10 km) in lowland Amazonia is not insulated from anthropogenic degradation within the surrounding landscape.	[Rutt, Cameron L.

J	Sperber, E; Hern, E				Sperber, Elizabeth; Hern, Erin			Comparing Pentecostal and Charismatic Christians' Religious and Political Beliefs Across Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa	JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION			English	Article						Renewalist Christianity; Pentecostal; Charismatic; Catholic; religious beliefs; political attitudes; Latin America; sub-Saharan Africa	CIVIL-SOCIETY; MOBILIZATION; ENGAGEMENT; CHURCHES	This article compares the political correlates of Renewalist Christianity in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa (N = 44,832). Renewalists include Pentecostals and Charismatic members of Mainline Protestant and Catholic churches. Though rarely studied comparatively, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa boast the largest Renewalist populations worldwide. Scholars have noted that the religious and political beliefs of Renewalists differ from other Christians, but existing studies either treat Renewalists as a single category or focus on Pentecostals while pooling Charismatic and non-Charismatic Catholics and Protestants as denominational blocks. Using multilevel mixed-effects models, this article first confirms that Renewalists' religious and political beliefs differ from those of non-Renewalist Christians. Importantly, this cautions against the ubiquitous aggregation of Charismatic and non-Charismatic Catholics (and Protestants) in statistical analyses. Additionally, we theorize and evaluate differences between Renewalists and the role of regional context. Religious differences between Pentecostals and Charismatics, we show, are much larger in Latin America than in Sub-Saharan Africa.

This study aimed to adapt and translate the Arthritis Helplessness Index scale into a Chinese version of an LH scale for maintenance hemodialysis patients in China (LHS-MHD-C), and to validate its psychometric properties. Data collected included LHS-MHD-C, as well as the Hospital Depression Scale (HADS-D), and the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) for assessing LHS-MHD-C's criterion validity (predictive and concurrent, respectively). The expert consultation and the pilot study demonstrated semantic and conceptual equivalence and content validity (except for Item 3, the item content validity ranged from 0.82 to 1, and the scale content validity was 0.95). An exploratory factor analysis (n = 146) eliminated three items and accepted 11 items for the two factors, explaining 63.87% of the total variance. A CFA (n = 218) showed that the two-factors structure was consistent with the LH theory. The LHS-MHD-C can distinguish between maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients of different ages, education, working status, monthly income, and MHD duration. The scale had good concurrent validity with the BHS (r = .78, p < 0.01). Using the HADS-D as a criterion, the LHS-MHD-C showed a sensitivity of 86.2% and a specificity of 96.8%. A total score of 36.5 may be the best cut-off value for predicting MHD patients' depression. The scale showed good reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha value of .759, test-retest reliability of 0.772, and split-half reliability of 0.774). This study found that the LHS-MHD-C is a reliable and valid scale for assessing Chinese MHD patients' helplessness.

J	Zhang, YA; Zhu, SY				Zhang, Yi-Ang; Zhu, Songye			Novel Model-free Optimal Active Vibration Control Strategy Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning	STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING			English	Article							QUADRATIC TRACKING CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK	Neural networks (NNs) can provide a simple solution to complex structural vibration control problems. However, most past NN-based control strategies cannot guarantee an optimal policy in structural vibration control. In this study, a novel active vibration control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed, which utilizes the learning ability of NN controllers and simultaneously provides control performance comparable to traditional model-based optimal controllers. The proposed learning algorithm can determine the control policy through interaction with the environment without knowing dynamic system models. This study shows that the proposed model-free strategy can provide optimal control performance to various systems and excitations. The proposed control strategy is first verified on a single-degree-of-freedom model and subsequently extended to a multi-degree-of-freedom shear-building model. Its control performance with full-state feedback is nearly the same as that of a classical linear quadratic regulator. Moreover, the learned policy can outperform a traditional output feedback controller in a partially observed system. The robustness of the proposed control strategy against measurement noise is also tested.

J	Zhou, SH; Van Bortle, K				Zhou, Sihang; Van Bortle, Kevin			The Pol III transcriptome: Basic features, recurrent patterns, and emerging roles in cancer	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-RNA			English	Review						RNA polymerase III; small RNA; noncoding RNA; cancer biology; transcription	LONG NONCODING RNA; 5S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; SMALL NUCLEAR-RNA; SIGNAL RECOGNITION PARTICLE; POLYMERASE-III; CELL-PROLIFERATION; VAULT RNA; U6 SNRNA; ALU RNA; Y-RNAS	The RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcriptome is universally comprised of short, highly structured noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Through RNA-protein interactions, the Pol III transcriptome actuates functional activities ranging from nuclear gene regulation (7SK), splicing (U6, U6atac), and RNA maturation and stability (RMRP, RPPH1, Y RNA), to cytoplasmic protein targeting (7SL) and translation (tRNA, 5S rRNA). In higher eukaryotes, the Pol III transcriptome has expanded to include additional, recently evolved ncRNA species that effectively broaden the footprint of Pol III transcription to additional cellular activities. Newly evolved ncRNAs function as riboregulators of autophagy (vault), immune signaling cascades (nc886), and translation (Alu, BC200, snaR). Notably, upregulation of Pol III transcription is frequently observed in cancer, and multiple ncRNA species are linked to both cancer progression and poor survival outcomes among cancer patients. In this review, we outline the basic features and functions of the Pol III transcriptome, and the evidence for dysregulation and dysfunction for each ncRNA in cancer. When taken together, recurrent patterns emerge, ranging from shared functional motifs that include molecular scaffolding and protein sequestration, overlapping protein interactions, and immunostimulatory activities, to the biogenesis of analogous small RNA fragments and noncanonical miRNAs, augmenting the function of the Pol III transcriptome and further broadening its role in cancer.This article is categorized under:RNA in Disease and Development > RNA in DiseaseRNA Processing > Processing of Small RNAsRNA Interactions with Proteins and Other Molecules > Protein-RNA Interactions: Functional Implications	[Zhou, Sihang; Van Bortle, Kevin] Univ Illinois, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Urbana, IL USA; [Van Bortle, Kevin] Univ Illinois, Canc Ctr Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Van Bortle, Kevin] Univ Illinois, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA	University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign	Van Bortle, K (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.	kvbortle@illinois.edu		Zhou, Sihang/0000-0002-7132-1560; Van Bortle, Kevin/0000-0003-0733-0830	National Human Genome Research Institute [R00HG010362]	National Human Genome Research Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI))	National Human Genome Research Institute, Grant/Award Number: R00HG010362		270	2	2	7	8	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1757-7004	1757-7012		WIRES RNA	Wiley Interdiscip.

Our study focuses on using the precise source positions obtained via improved astrometry based on Chandra and HST observations to search for and identify optical counterparts for these ULXs. Unique optical counterparts are identified for X2 and X6; two potential counterparts were determined for X1, X5, and X7 within the respective error radii while no optical counterparts were found for the remaining four sources. Based on spectral energy distributions, X-ray, and optical temporal analyses, some evidences about the nature of X1 and X2 were obtained.

Easy electrochemical reduction of nitro groups can be used for their voltammetric determination using mercury based electrodes. However, requirements of green analytical chemistry prompted us to investigate a novel type of silver porous electrode (AgPE) prepared by powder metallurgy compatible with both "green" and "white" analytical chemistry requirements. In this paper, AgPE was for the first time successfully used for differential pulse voltammetric determination of micromolar concentrations of 2-nitrophenol (NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) in aqueous media. The main advantage of the novel method is the possibility to use small sample volume (down to 25 mu L) and to work in the presence of oxygen when using supporting electrolyte of pH 3. This advantage partially compensates the fact that the obtained sensitivity and limit of detection are not better than with the previously investigated electrodes.

In this work, hydrophobic 2,2'-methylene-bis-(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) organic phosphate (MBP) with multiple methyl groups was firstly used for HNT compatibilization modification. The hydrophobicity transition of modified HNT (HNT-M) and the dispersibility difference in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) matrix were distinguished by water contact angle and SEM analyses, respectively. In addition, the binding energy evaluated the interfacial interaction and compatibility with matrix before and after modification by molecular dynamic simulation. Correspondingly, the iPP performance was optimized after addition of HNT-M. The onset decomposition temperature of system at 5% and 10% weight loss was increased by 7 and 11? compared with neat iPP, respectively. Moreover, the flexural modulus and impact strength of iPP/HNT-M system were 18.9% and 9.6% higher than neat iPP showing simultaneous enhancement. In addition, iPP/HNT-M system crystallized begin at higher temperature showing enhanced crystallization ability. Furthermore, the faster crystallization process and more uniform spherulite size were obtained. As a result, the enhancement for iPP performance was obtained when the compatibility between HNT and matrix was improved through surface modification.

This study aims to investigate the association between uric acid levels and risk of new-onset AF. Methods and ResultsA total of 339 604 individuals 30 to 60 years of age and free from cardiovascular disease at baseline (1985-1996) in the Swedish AMORIS (Apolipoprotein-Mortality Risk) cohort were followed until December 31, 2019 for incident AF. Cox regression models were used to examine the association between uric acid and AF, adjusting for potential confounders and stratifying by incident cardiovascular disease. Over a mean follow-up of 25.9 years, 46 516 incident AF cases occurred. Compared with the lowest uric acid quartile, each of the upper 3 quartiles were associated with an increased risk of AF in a dose-response manner. Adjusted hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% CI, 1.06-1.12) for second quartile, 1.19 (95% CI, 1.16-1.23) for third quartile, and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.41-1.49) for fourth quartile. The association was similar among individuals with and without incident hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, or coronary heart disease. The dose-response pattern was further supported in a subsample of individuals with repeated measurements of uric acid. ConclusionsElevated uric acid was associated with an increased risk of AF, not only among people with cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors but also among those without. Future investigations are needed to examine whether lowering uric acid is relevant for AF prevention.

Shell-less culture system for chick embryos from the blastoderm stage to hatching	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						blastoderm; calcium; chick embryo; shell-less culture; turntable	ION-TRANSPORT; MINERAL-CONTENT; QUAIL EMBRYOS; FLUID; EGG; SODIUM; GROWTH; CULTIVATION; EXPRESSION; TABLES	Since 2014, methods have been described to hatch chick embryos from shell-less culture after egg contents are first incubated within shells for 55-70 h. The present report describes for the first time a shell-less culture system for chick embryos from the blastoderm stage to hatching. For the first 69-70 h, egg contents suspended in polymethylpentene kitchen wrap (F.O.R. Wrap, Riken Fabro, Tokyo, Japan) supported in 6.35 or 6.67 cm inside diameter tripods and covered with a disc of immobilized Milli-Wrap, were rotated back and forth through 90 degrees at 16 or 22 cycles per minute (CPM). Subsequently, the Milli-Wrap disc was removed and culture tripods were transferred to environmental chambers, which were rocked +/- 20 degrees through incubation day 8.5 (E8.5). From E9, environmental chambers were maintained in the horizontal position through to hatching with controlled O-2 and CO2. To provide supplemental calcium, an aqueous solution containing 100 mg/mL of calciuml-lactate hydrate was injected through the plastic wrap into the albumen at E9 (2.5 mL) and at E13 (1.0 mL) or E15 (1.0 mL). After incubation for 69-70 h at 16 or 22 CPM, 80%-83% of previously unincubated egg contents yielded apparently normal embryos. Hatch rate of normal embryos resulting from turntable incubation at 16 or 22 CPM was approximately 43%. Of note, egg contents remained in the same culture tripod from blastoderm stage to hatching. This technique may find use as an educational tool and in basic investigations of early embryogenesis, teratogenesis, and gene transfer experiments.	[Dunn, Bruce E.

Materials and Methods: The study cohort included 26 patients with SUI between October 2019 and November 2020. Patients were treated with two sessions of FemTouch vaginal fractional CO2 laser with a one-month interval. Three subjective assessments were administered to all patients: female sexual function index (FSFI), vaginal health index score (VHIS), and international consultation on incontinence questionnaire-short form (ICIQ-SF). Vaginal tissue biopsies were taken from 6 patients before treatment and one-month after the final treatment. Vaginal tactile imaging (VTI) measurements, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed before treatment and 10-12-months after treatment in 10, 9, and 6 patients, respectively. Results: The average age of the cohort was 39.5 +/- 12.0 years. The overall scores for FSFI, VHIS, and ICIQ-SF significantly improved in patients after each treatment sessions as compared with baseline scores. VTI showed significantly increased pressure resistance of both the anterior and posterior vaginal walls after treatment. Ultrasonography showed significant decreases in bladder neck mobility and urethrovesical angle during the Valsalva maneuver after treatment. MRI scans showed significant decreases in the length of the vaginal anterior wall after treatment. Histological examination confirmed that the laser treatment led to a thicker stratified squamous epithelium layer as compared to the baseline. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that vaginal fractional CO2 laser treatment can restore vaginal biomechanical and physiological properties by increasing vaginal tightening and improving pelvic floor structures.

The objective of this study was to investigate sexual dimorphism in the growth performance of aquaculture-produced PBT and develop techniques for its sex manipulation, for the first time in tuna. A comparison of the body size between sexes revealed that male-cultured PBTs were larger than females at harvest. We also confirmed that cyp19a1a (encoding a gonadal aromatase) expression increased specifically in the genotypic female PBT gonads during sex differentiation. This suggested that aromatase plays an important role in ovarian differentiation and that the suppression of aromatase activity may effectively induce masculinization in genotypic females. Therefore, we administered letrozole-an aromatase inhibitor (AI)-into sexually undifferentiated PBT through the oral route. AI administration resulted in a 100% sex reversal of genotypic females into phenotypic males at the molecular level. Our results provide the basis for future studies on the establishment of mono-sex male production technology in PBT, which would help improve the productivity of closed-cycle PBT aquaculture. Furthermore, this study offers important insights into the understanding of the sex-wise growth of tuna species in aquacultural settings, and developing sex manipulation techniques.

Garlic essential oil contains a variety of organosulfur compounds, such as the most representative diallyl disulfides (DADS) and diallyl trisulfides (DATS), which have attracted great interest in medicine, food, and agriculture because of their rich biological activities. This paper reviews the research progress on the composition and bioactivities of garlic essential oil mixtures and the bioactivity of some typical monomeric sulfides in garlic essential oil. The active mechanisms of representative sulfides in garlic essential oil were analyzed, and the applications of garlic essential oil in functional food, food additives, and clinical treatment were discussed. Combined with the current research status, the limitations and development direction of garlic essential oil in the study of molecular mechanism were discussed, which is of great significance to the development of garlic essential oil as a natural and safe alternative medicine for treatment.

The purpose of this science advisory is to (1) describe the burden of developmental disorders, disabilities, and delays for infants with complex congenital heart disease, (2) define the potential health and neurodevelopmental benefits of developmental care for infants with complex congenital heart disease, and (3) identify critical gaps in research aimed at evaluating developmental care interventions to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in complex congenital heart disease. This call to action targets research scientists, clinicians, policymakers, government agencies, advocacy groups, and health care organization leadership to support funding and hospital-based infrastructure for developmental care in the complex congenital heart disease population. Prioritization of research on and implementation of developmental care interventions in this population should be a major focus in the next decade.

We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the coordination of the turgor loss point and associated traits with net CO2 assimilation (A(n)) and leaf mass per area (LMA). We measured gas exchange, pressure-volume curves and leaf structure in 45 ferns and angiosperms, and explored the anatomical and chemical basis of the key traits. We propose that the coordination observed between mass-based A(n), capacitance and the turgor loss point (pi(tlp)) emerges from their shared link with leaf density (one of the components of LMA) and, specially, leaf saturated water content (LSWC), which in turn relates to cell size and nitrogen and carbon content. Thus, considering the components of LMA and LSWC in ecophysiological studies can provide a broader perspective on leaf structure and function.

Over 6000 machine log files from delivered IMPT treatment plans were included in this study. From these log files, over 4.1 x$ \times \ $10(6) delivered proton spots were used to train the ML model. The presented model was tested and used to predict the spot position as well as the monitor units (MU) per spot, based on the original planning parameters. Two patient plans (one accelerated partial breast irradiation [APBI] and one ependymoma) were recalculated with the predicted spot position/MUs by the ML model and then were re-analyzed for robustness. Plans with ML predicted spots were less robust than the original clinical plans. In the APBI plan, dosimetric changes to the left lung and heart were not clinically relevant. In the ependymoma plan, the hot spot in the brainstem decreased and the hot spot in the cervical cord increased. Despite these differences, after robustness analysis, both ML spot delivery error plans resulted in >95% of the CTV receiving >95% of the prescription dose. The presented workflow has the potential benefit of including realistic spots information for plan quality checks in IMPT. This work demonstrates that in the two example plans, the plans were still robust when accounting for spot delivery errors as predicted by the ML model.

Due to the lack of precise information on DMDA computation in earlier studies, this work proposes DMDA including fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag as a viable way to improve the long-term performance of green concrete. To encourage the use of DMDA, this study offers a detailed description of the DMDA mix design, as well as a step-by-step standard operating procedure and an empirical example of the computation. Assessments of the long-term performance of green mixtures (self-consolidating concrete and high-performance concrete) and ordinary Portland cement concrete (designed using the conventional method of American Concrete Institute, ACI) were made. Performances of the ACI (O6000 mixture) and DMDA concretes (S6000 and H6000 mixtures) were then compared in terms of compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage, and creep strain. As a result, all of the concrete samples attained the target strength of above 41 MPa (6000 psi) after only 28 days. Moreover, compressive strength, elastic modulus, shrinkage, and creep strain increased significantly in all of the concretes over curing time. Importantly, the experimental results confirmed that both types of DMDA concrete exhibited higher compressive strength and better long-term performance than the ACI concrete under elastic modulus, creep, and shrinkage aspects.

J	Reischke, R				Reischke, Robert			Copolymerization Reactivity Ratio Inference: Determining Confidence Contours in Parameter Space via a Bayesian Hierarchical Approach	MACROMOLECULAR THEORY AND SIMULATIONS			English	Article						confidence contours; confidence ellipse; copolymerization kinetics; parameter estimation; parameter space; polymer reaction engineering; reactivity ratios	METHYL-METHACRYLATE	Confidence contours in parameter space are a helpful tool to compare and classify determined estimators. For more intricate parameter estimations of nonlinear nature or complex error structures, the procedure of determining confidence contours is a statistically complex task. For polymer chemists, such particular cases are encountered in determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization. Hereby, determination of reactivity ratios in copolymerization requires nonlinear parameter estimation. Additionally, data may possess (possibly correlated) errors in both dependent and independent variables. A common approach for such nonlinear estimations is the error-in-variables model yielding statistically unbiased estimators. Regarding reactivity ratios, to date published procedures neglect the non-Gaussian structure of the error estimates that is a consequence of the nonlinearity of the model. In this publication, this issue is addressed by employing a Bayesian hierarchical model, which correctly propagates the errors of all variables. The statistical procedure is discussed in chemist friendly language to encourage confident usage of the tool. The approach is based on a Python program requiring minimal installation effort. A detailed manual of the code is included in the appendix of this work, in an effort to make this procedure available to all interested polymer chemists.

J	Sahoo, SK; Vathsan, R; Qureshi, T				Sahoo, Sourav Kesharee; Vathsan, Radhika; Qureshi, Tabish			Emergence of Classicality in Stern-Gerlach Experiment via Self-Gravity	ANNALEN DER PHYSIK			English	Article						Stern-Gerlach experiment; Schrodinger-Newton equation; self-gravitational interaction; semi-classical gravity; emergence of classicality	QUANTUM; LOCALIZATION	Emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics, a hotly debated topic, has had no satisfactory resolution so far. Various approaches including decoherence and gravitational interactions have been suggested. In the present work, the Schrodinger-Newton model is used to study the role of semi-classical self-gravity in the evolution of massive spin-1/2 particles in a Stern-Gerlach experiment. For small mass, evolution of the initial wavepacket in a spin superposition shows a splitting in the magnetic field gradient into two trajectories as in the standard Stern-Gerlach experiment. For larger mass, the deviations from the central path are less than in the standard Stern-Gerlach case, while for high enough mass, the wavepacket does not split, and instead follows the classical trajectory for a magnetic moment in inhomogeneous magnetic field. This indicates the emergence of classicality due to self-gravitational interaction when the mass is increased. In contrast, decoherence which is a strong contender for emergence of classicality, leads to a mixed state of two trajectories corresponding to the spin-up and spin-down states, and not the classically expected path. The classically expected path of the particle probably cannot be explained even in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Stern-Gerlach experiments in the macroscopic domain are needed to settle this question.

Data are lacking regarding recent oral anticoagulant (OAC) usage trends among US patients with cirrhosis and NVAF. Methods and ResultsUsing MarketScan claims data (2012-2019), we identified patients with cirrhosis and NVAF eligible for OACs (CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score >= 2 [men] or >= 3 [women]). We calculated the yearly proportion of patients prescribed a direct OAC (DOAC), warfarin, or no OAC. We stratified by high-risk features (decompensated cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease). Among 32 487 patients (mean age=71.6 years, 38.5% women, 15.1% with decompensated cirrhosis, mean CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc=4.2), 44.6% used OACs within 180 days of NVAF diagnosis, including DOACs (20.2%) or warfarin (24.4%). Compared with OAC nonusers, OAC users were less likely to have decompensated cirrhosis (18.6% versus 10.7%), thrombocytopenia (19.5% versus 12.5%), or chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease (15.5% versus 14.0%). Between 2012 and 2019, warfarin use decreased by 21.0% (32.0% to 11.0%), whereas DOAC use increased by 30.6% (7.4% to 38.0%), and among all DOACs between 2012 and 2019, apixaban was the most commonly prescribed (46.1%). Warfarin use decreased and DOAC use increased in all subgroups, including in compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease/end-stage renal disease, and across CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc categories. Among OAC users (2012-2019), DOAC use increased by 58.9% (18.7% to 77.6%). Among DOAC users, the greatest proportional increase was with apixaban (61.2%; P < 0.001). ConclusionsAmong US patients with cirrhosis and NVAF, DOAC use has increased substantially and surpassed warfarin, including in decompensated cirrhosis. Nevertheless, > 55% of patients remain untreated, underscoring the need for clearer treatment guidance.

Any conflict and its resolution can therefore benefit from insights into trust dynamics. The deployment of computational trust management methods and agent technologies provide promising options. They have already been successfully applied in many domains, while in conflict research (and possible resolution policies) they are rather unexplored. This research paper therefore presents an approach that is based on a formalized, anthropocentric trust management method. It deploys it accordingly in agents' simulations to obtain new insights into the dynamics of trust in cooperation-conflict interplay, and to enable derivation of strategies for managing societies to drive them toward desired states.

In this study, we aim to raise awareness of CMS to paediatricians.Methods: We performed a retrospective case study of infants and preschool children treated in the past 5 years in Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands for respiratory insufficiency as presenting symptom of CMS.Results: Five children aged 2 weeks to 5 years experienced severe to life-threatening episodes of respiratory insufficiency, especially during viral infections, due to respiratory muscle weakness. During infections, they often also had progression of their otherwise mild ocular, facial, and limb muscle weakness. They were eventually diagnosed with genetically proven CMS. In these five children, treatment with pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, resulted in clinical improvement.Conclusion: CMS should be considered in every patient with unexplained recurrent respiratory insufficiency, or with an unusually severe course of a normally mild respiratory infection, especially in combination with mild muscle weakness outside periods of illness. Early diagnosis of CMS is crucial for early treatment, which may help avoiding sudden infant death, severe respiratory insufficiency and further deterioration of the muscle strength.

Here, we show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae trm9 Delta, distinct DNA repair and spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) mutants are differentially sensitive to the aminoglycosides tobramycin, gentamicin and amikacin, indicating DDR and SAC activation might rely on translation fidelity, under aminoglycoside stress. Further, we report that the DNA damage induced by aminoglycosides in the base excision repair mutants ogg1 Delta and apn1 Delta is mediated by reactive oxygen species, which induce the DNA adduct 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine. Finally, the synergistic effect of tobramycin and the DNA-damaging agent bleomycin to sensitize trm9 Delta and the DDR mutants mlh1 Delta, rad51 Delta, mre11 Delta and sgs1 Delta at significantly lower concentrations compared with wild-type suggests that cells with tRNA modification dysregulation and DNA repair gene defects can be selectively sensitized using a combination of translation inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents.

The existing polymer membranes that mimic human skin functions are limited to secreting, either apolar or polar, liquid. However, the development of membranes that grant exchange liquid with different polarities remains a grand challenge. This process is prohibited by the mismatch of the polarity between the carrier polymer and the loaded liquid. To conquer this limitation, an innovative strategy is reported to dynamically switch the polarity of the porous membrane, thereby empowering the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid and vice versa. This approach incorporates a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. The benzoic acid dimerizes and forms hydrogen bonds, which supports the molecular alignment, but can be broken into the ionic state when subjected to alkaline treatment, changing the polarity of themembrane. Consequently, the apolar liquid can be replaced with a more polar one. This polar liquid is ejected upon safe-dose UV illumination from the membrane. Reabsorption occurs on demand by illumination of visible light or when left in contact with the membrane, spontaneously in the dark. Based on this, the consumed membrane is replenished with the same or different exchanging liquid.	[Zhan, Yuanyuan; Broer, Dirk J.

JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						emulsion; oil droplets; interface membrane; proteins	LIPID EXTRACTION; CREAM EMULSION; DEMULSIFICATION; MICROALGAE; BODIES; RICH	BACKGROUNDThe interaction between emulsified substances and lipids generates an emulsification system during the extraction of microalgae edible oil by aqueous enzymatic method. This study aimed to resolve the dynamics of interfacial protein adsorption during the extraction of microalgae oil at different enzymatic times and the effect on the stability of the interfacial membrane formed by the proteins based on interfacial effects. RESULTSAt 1.5 h of enzymatic hydrolysis, the molecular weights of the proteins/peptides were all below 35 kD. In addition, the protein-peptide structure was loose, with the lowest number of disulfide bonds, peak surface hydrophobicity, the highest number of residues, and disordered lipid acyl arrangement. At the same time, the physical stability of the emulsion was the lowest, and the interfacial membrane rupture was distinct. On excessive enzymatic hydrolysis (at 3.0 h), a more uniform interfacial membrane was re-formed on the lipid surface. CONCLUSIONProtein is the main emulsifying substance in the emulsification system. The addition of protease affects the stability of the interfacial membrane formed by proteins. In addition, sufficient enzymatic hydrolysis (1.5 h) inhibited emulsification, while excessive enzymatic hydrolysis (3.0 h) promoted emulsification. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Diagnostic imaging revealed unilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. In addition, it showed thickening of the distal ureteric wall and focal thickening of the mucosa of the bladder trigone between the ureters. No mass was identified. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, and biopsies of the bladder mucosal thickening and right ureteral thickening were obtained. Histopathology of the ureteral thickening was suggestive of a ureteral rhabdomyosarcoma. A right ureteroneocystostomy was performed, and histopathology confirmed the suspected ureteral rhabdomyosarcoma, which was fully excised. Six months later, the patient remains asymptomatic with no evidence of recurrence or metastases on abdominal ultrasonography.	[Bras, Ines; Hall, E.

Firstly, the QVNNs are decomposed into four equivalent real-valued systems, and based on the geometrical configuration of the AFs, the state space Hn is divided into 34n disjoint regions. Considering the properties of AFs, several sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the coexistence of 34n equilibria, out of which 24n are locally mu-stable. Moreover, some sufficient conditions for multiple exponential stability, multiple power stability, andmultiple log stability are also derived in this article. Finally, two numerical examples are presented. The first example validates the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results while the second example illustrates the application of QVNNs on the associative memory, which shows that QVNNs have the ability to reliably retrieve true- color image patterns.

J	Huwang, L; Liao, YM				Huwang, Longcheen; Liao, Yen-Ming			A new non-parametric control chart for monitoring general linear profiles based on log-linear modelling	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						ARL; CUSUM; log-linear modelling; profile monitoring; Wilcoxon rank estimators	STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; CHANGE-POINT METHOD; PHASE-I ANALYSIS; PRODUCT	Profile monitoring has received much attention from the applications in statistical process control. It is a method for monitoring the stability of a functional relationship between a response variable and one or more explanatory variables over the time axis. General linear profiles monitoring is very important since the linear relationship between a response variable and explanatory variables is easy to characterize besides it is simple and flexible. In addition, most of general linear profiles monitoring techniques assume normality of random error variables. However, the normality of random error variables is not satisfied in certain applications. This causes the existing monitoring methods for general linear profiles both inadequate and inefficient. Based on the log-linear modelling, in this paper, we develop a non-parametric control chart for Phase II monitoring of general linear profiles where normality of random error variables is not assumed. The proposed charting method applies the CUSUM (cumulative sum) to the Pearson chi-square test for the Wilcoxon-type rank-based estimators of coefficient parameters and an estimator of random error variance. Effectiveness of the developed control chart is assessed and compared with that of two existing control charts based on the criterion of ARL (average run length). An industrial production process example is also applied to illustrate how the proposed control chart can be used in practice.

The flow equations for the problem are developed and converted into dimensionless form with the help of dimensionless variables and then finally simplified by a well-known lubrication approximation theory (LAT). To eliminate the pressure gradient from the governed equations, stream function is introduced. The final equations are solved numerically using Matlab built-in procedure "bvp4c" to get the stream function and pressure gradient. The pressure and engineering quantities such as power input function and roll-separating force are calculated by Runge-Kutta fourth order method. The impact of the Johnson-Segalman parameter and slip parameter on pressure, velocity and engineering quantities are presented with the help of various graphs. The Newtonian model predicts higher pressure in the nip zone than the Johnson-Segalman fluid model, according to our findings. In the presence of the slip parameter, the force and power functions exhibit 37% and 61.71% decreases from Newtonian values, respectively. As the slip parameter is increased, the pressure distribution diminishes.

The V3C++N-2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion-trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C-1-symmetry. N-2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end-on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N equivalent to N triple bond and subsequent C-N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)](+) exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530 cm(-1)) and V-N single bond (770, 541 and 522 cm(-1)) stretching bands.

Four wetland types (Riparian lower-beach wetland [RLW], Riparian higher-beach wetland [RHW], Cultivated wetland [CW] and Mesophytic wetland [MW]) were selected in the lower Yellow River area to investigate the consequence of wetland type conversion on soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry. The results demonstrated that wetland conversion induced significant spatio-temporal variations in soil C, N and P stoichiometry and physicochemical characteristics in soil. Frequent agricultural activities (fertilizer input) raised the nutrient content of natural wetland, particularly in surface soil (0-30 cm). Soil volumetric water content (VWC), soil bulk density (SBD), pH and soil enzyme activity varied significantly in different wetlands. Total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents in MW decreased with increasing soil depth (<40 cm layers), as did TN and total phosphorus (TP) contents in CW. On the other hand, TC, TN and TP contents in RLW and RHW did not change significantly with soil depth. However, the contents of TOC, NO3--N and Fe/Al-P, etc., varied among soil layers and among wetland types. Furthermore, the stoichiometric characteristics changed significantly in some soil layers, with mean values being less than the Chinese average. Statistically, significant positive correlations were determined between TC and TN (r = .56), TDC and TP (r = .62), N:P and pH (r = .57) (p < .05) and NO3--N and pH (r = .66, p < .01). VWC was negatively correlated with pH (r = -.56, p < .05), while C/P was negatively associated with soil temperature (ST) and SBD (r = -.55, r = -.64, p < .05). TDC, IP, TN, Fe/Al-P and ST were identified as the dominant factors, with the percentage of variance 41%, 20%, 12%, 9% and 6% respectively. These findings have a great scientific significance for the ecological conservation of wetlands in the lower Yellow River area.

An actin remodeling role for <i>Arabidopsis</i> processing bodies revealed by their proximity interactome	EMBO JOURNAL			English	Article						ARP2-ARP3; condensates; LLPS; plasma membrane domains; SCAR-WAVE	MESSENGER-RNA DECAY; LIQUID-LIKE; PLANT; PROTEINS; GRANULES; PATHWAY; COMPLEX; SCAR; COLOCALIZATION; POLYMERIZATION	Cellular condensates can comprise membrane-less ribonucleoprotein assemblies with liquid-like properties. These cellular condensates influence various biological outcomes, but their liquidity hampers their isolation and characterization. Here, we investigated the composition of the condensates known as processing bodies (PBs) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana through a proximity-biotinylation proteomics approach. Using in situ protein-protein interaction approaches, genetics and high-resolution dynamic imaging, we show that processing bodies comprise networks that interface with membranes. Surprisingly, the conserved component of PBs, DECAPPING PROTEIN 1 (DCP1), can localize to unique plasma membrane subdomains including cell edges and vertices. We characterized these plasma membrane interfaces and discovered a developmental module that can control cell shape. This module is regulated by DCP1, independently from its role in decapping, and the actin-nucleating SCAR-WAVE complex, whereby the DCP1-SCAR-WAVE interaction confines and enhances actin nucleation. This study reveals an unexpected function for a conserved condensate at unique membrane interfaces.

Expanding growers' choice of plant disease management options can promote suboptimal social outcomes	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						behavioural model; epidemiological model; Gini coefficient; Pareto optimization; tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV)	LEAF CURL VIRUS; RESISTANCE; TOMATO; RISK; BACTERIAL; FLORIDA; SPREAD	Previous models of growers' decision-making during epidemics have unrealistically limited disease management choices to just two options. Here, we expand previous game-theoretic models of grower decision-making to include three control options: a crop that is tolerant, resistant or susceptible to disease. Using tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) as a case study, we investigate how growers can be incentivized to use different control options to achieve socially optimal outcomes. To do this, we consider the efforts of a 'social planner' who moderates the price of crops. We find that subsidizing a tolerant crop costs the social planner more in subsidies, as its use encourages selfishness and widespread adoption. Subsidizing a resistant crop, however, provides widespread benefits by reducing the prevalence of disease across the community of growers, including those that do not control, reducing the number of subsidies required from the social planner. We then use Gini coefficients to measure equitability of each subsidization scheme. This study highlights how grower behaviour can be altered using crop subsidies to promote socially optimal outcomes during epidemics.

J	Wong, KP				Pong Wong, Kit			A smooth ambiguity model of investment timing under asymmetric information	MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; UNCERTAINTY; RISK	This paper incorporates ambiguity into a principal-agent framework wherein an owner delegates the investment decision of a project in continuous time to a manager. Information is asymmetric in that the owner faces ambiguity regarding the uncertain investment cost of the project (low or high) but the manager privately observes the true value. Ambiguity aversion is shown to induce the owner to act in a pessimistic manner with a perception that the probability of having the low investment cost is smaller than what the objective beliefs suggest, resulting in a distortion on the equilibrium tradeoff between investment efficiency and information rent.

Seasonal Alterations in Testicular Hemodynamics and Echotexture in Relation to Semen Quality in Buffalo Bulls	ANDROLOGIA			English	Article							COLOR DOPPLER ULTRASONOGRAPHY; BLOOD-FLOW; STEROID-HORMONES; PIXEL INTENSITY; NITRIC-OXIDE; BOS-INDICUS; PLASMA; PARAMETERS; INCREASES; MELATONIN	The present study is aimed at investigating the usefulness of the pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography for the characterization of testicular blood flow in buffaloes during the nonbreeding and breeding seasons. Ten Egyptian buffalo bulls were evaluated for changes in the blood flow (Doppler's indices: resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI)) at the levels of supratesticular (STA) during the breeding (winter) and nonbreeding season (summer). The alterations in testicular parenchyma echotexture (pixel intensity (PIX) and echotexture heterogeneity (EH)) were assessed by computer analysis software. Circulating testosterone and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were measured colorimetrically. Sperm parameters including total and progressive motility %, viability %, morphology %, and concentrations were assessed. Results revealed lower values (p < 0.05) of RI (0.55 +/- 0.02) and PI (0.82 +/- 0.03) within the STA in the breeding period compared to the nonbreeding period (RI: 0.67 +/- 0.03; PI: 0.99 +/- 0.01). Higher (p < 0.05) PIX and EH were found in the nonbreeding season (PIX: 72.09 +/- 1.81; EH: 14.99 +/- 1.37) compared to the breeding season (PIX: 60.95 +/- 1.51; EH: 11.75 +/- 0.63). Concentrations of testosterone and TAC were not significantly changed. However, the concentrations of NO were greater (p < 0.05) during the breeding season (78.21 +/- 0.87) compared to those of the nonbreeding one (59.74 +/- 2.97). Total motility %, progressive motility %, viability %, and sperm concentrations were higher during the breeding season compared to that during the nonbreeding season (p < 0.05). In conclusion, seasonality alters testicular hemodynamics and echotexture, NO concentrations, and sperm quality in buffaloes without alterations in the testosterone and TAC levels.

Two concepts-fairness and partner choice-emerged as particularly relevant, and related behaviors were examined in the context of ongoing debates regarding cooperation in human societies. Children consistently invoked fairness as an important moral value, and they showed evidence of undergoing a developmental shift from equality-based to equity-based fairness by around seven years old. Children mediated disagreements primarily through partner choice strategies (avoidance and disengagement) rather than partner conflict (punishment). Local social values and child-rearing practices that promote personal autonomy and independence make punishment undesirable and rare in this context. The observed aversion to punishment in Helsinki differs from typical characterizations of so-called WEIRD societies and demonstrates the value that nuanced ethnographic studies in diverse societies can bring to understandings of human cooperation.

The valence state of Au-I and H- was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NMR, UV/Vis and XPS. The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2 % selectivity for H-2, whereas Au-8(2+) was selective for CO (73.5 %). Further DFT calculations showed that the H- ligand inhibited the CO2RR process compared with the electron-donor H.

J	Vandenbroucke, S				Vandenbroucke, Sarah			The portrayal of effectiveness of supplier codes of conduct in improving labor conditions in global supply chains: A systematic review of the literature	REGULATION & GOVERNANCE			English	Review; Early Access						code of conduct; labor conditions; supply chain; systematic review	GOAL DISPLACEMENT; WORK ORGANIZATION; CORPORATE CODES; STANDARDS; SAFETY; COMMITMENT; GOVERNMENT; BUSINESS; LESSONS; BENEFIT	Even though workplace conditions worldwide are subject to local and international laws, labor conditions in global supply chains have continuously raised human rights concerns. In response to societal pressure, multinationals have taken on a certain degree of responsibility regarding workplace conditions in supplier factories, notably by adopting codes of conduct. Investigating the impact of this self-regulatory policy, scholars have examined whether and how codes shape labor conditions at the production level, but the results of their empirical studies diverge and sometimes contradict. To bring clarity to the field and gain an overarching understanding of the impact of codes, this literature review analyzes the question of their effectiveness as examined in 33 scientific papers gathered via a systematic selection of empirical studies. The review shows that supplier codes are not deemed unanimously and evenly effective by scholars and often fail to improve labor conditions. However, a range of factors are identified that facilitate the implementation of codes and ensure its effectiveness. This article develops a taxonomy of these factors and intends to contribute to understanding codes' decoupling and recoupling processes by investigating the gap between codes provisions and their intended outcome: the improvement of labor practices in global supply chains.

For this reason, herein, we conducted an experimental method with the self-designed clamp to evaluate the influence of low-velocity impact (LVI) at the compressed area nearby the bolt hole on the residual tensile properties of bolt joint GFRP laminates with various stacking sequences. After comparing the displacement-force curves and failure modes of different bolt joints in tensile tests after LVI loading, the effect of LVI and the failure mechanism subjected to post-impact loading are discussed in depth. Tensile properties show that the damage caused by impact has a significant effect on the performance of the composite. Under the condition of incident energy of 9 J and distance of 6 mm from the center of the bolt hole to the impact point, the ultimate tensile value of Ply-A, Ply-B, and Ply-C samples are reduced by 32.3%, 34.6%, and 50%, respectively. This influence can also be confirmed by observing the failure morphology, describing the interlaminar behavior of the specimens varying stacking sequence, where a more serious interlaminar damage was identified at Ply-C specimens. In addition, we also utilized the VIC-2D device to record and analyze the strain of different ply stacking sequence specimens in the failure process. The result shows that all types of cases have the same initial failure mode of bearing, but various final failure modes.

We present herein a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for the direct nitration of aromatic compounds and terminal aryl-substituted olefins in the presence of a dual-functional small molecule (DFSM). Site-directed mutations of key active-site residues allowed the efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease in monooxygenation activity and increase in peroxidase activity. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho- and para-nitration products with moderate-to-high total turnover numbers. Besides direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent, we also demonstrated the use of the DFSM-facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.

If repeatable GE patterns are identified, then the target region must be divided into subregions or MEs. Breeding and utilizing ME-specific cultivars will convert the repeatable GE into genotypic main effect (G) within ME, thereby improving heritability (selection reliability) and selection gain and maximize regional and overall productivity. If no repeatable GE is found, then the target region must be treated as a single ME and the GE must be accommodated by testing adequately, that is, at a sufficient number of locations in a sufficient number of years. This paper presents a theoretical framework of ME analysis, describes graphical tools to reveal the which-won-where patterns in a genotype-by-environment dataset, and demonstrates LG (location-grouping) biplot analysis for revealing repeatable GE patterns and delineating MEs. The concept of G + GE or GGE, that is, GE relative to G, is emphasized. It is the relative GE that is the basis for ME analysis and breeding for specific adaptation; absolute magnitude of GE has little relevance for these purposes. Breeding ME-specific oat cultivars in Canada is demonstrated with a real-world example.

Three toes and three modes: Dynamics of terrestrial, suspensory, and vertical locomotion in brown-throated three-toed sloths (<i>Bradypodidae, Xenarthra</i>)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						arb; biomechanics; gait; inverted quadrupedalism; orealPilosa	LIMB WEIGHT SUPPORT; CHOLOEPUS-HOFFMANNI; 2-TOED SLOTHS; BRADYPUS-VARIEGATUS; ARBOREAL GAITS; TREE SLOTHS; MECHANICS; EVOLUTION; PRIMATES; FORCES	Living sloths exhibit numerous anatomical specializations towards inverted quadrupedalism, however, previous studies have noted a more varied locomotor repertoire than previously anticipated. In this study, we present spatiotemporal gait characteristics and triaxial kinetic data from the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) across three locomotor modes: terrestrial quadrupedal "crawling," suspensory walking, and vertical climbing. Compared to quadrupedal crawling and suspensory walking, B. variegatus adopted longer contact times and stride durations, larger duty factors, and greater speed during vertical climbing. Net fore-aft impulses were significantly greater during vertical climbing in both limb pairs than in quadrupedal crawling and suspensory walking. Functionally, during quadrupedal crawling and vertical climbing, both limb pairs served propulsive roles, while differentiation between a propulsive forelimb and braking hindlimb was observed during suspension. Net tangential forces differentiated vertical climbing kinetics from the other modes of locomotion, with the introduction of bidirectional pulling and pushing forces in the forelimb and hindlimb, respectively. The net mediolateral impulses were similar in vertical climbing and quadrupedal crawling as both limb pairs directed forces in one direction, whereas during suspensory walking, the laterally dominant forelimb was opposed by the medially dominant hindlimb. In total, this study provides novel data on the diverse locomotor dynamics in a slow-moving arboreal tetrapod and posits new testable hypotheses about the neuroplasticity and ease of transitioning between locomotor behaviors. The strikingly similar kinetic profiles of quadrupedal crawling and suspensory walking compared to vertical climbing suggest shared neuromuscular and mechanical demands between these mirrored locomotor modes.

However, such architectures are difficult to grow to a size suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD); the lack of single-crystal structures of these architectures leads to challenges in gaining deeper comprehension about that. This study reports a hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso-tetra(4-sulfonato-phenyl)-porphyrin (TSPP4-) and N, N '-diethyl-viologen (DEV2+), wherein wave-like and saddle-like TSPP4- ions co-aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1 : 2 to form unique porphyrin arrays; the spectrum characteristics and calculated coulombic exciton coupling energy show that these porphyrin arrays are J-aggregates. We prove that the distortion of porphyrin ring of TSPP4- strongly correlates with the deflection of its phenyl groups. The crystal comprises six different ionic conformations, and the multiplicity of ionic conformation leads to intricate supramolecular interactions.

Data on functional motor disorder (FMD) are currently poor and conflicting. We aimed to examine the rate of failure on three different PVTs of nonlitigant, non-compensation-seeking FMD patients, and we compared their performance to that of healthy controls and controls asked to simulate malingering (healthy simulators).Methods We enrolled 29 nonlitigant, non-compensation-seeking patients with a clinical diagnosis of FMD, 29 healthy controls, and 29 healthy simulators. Three PVTs, the Coin in the Hand Test (CIH), the Rey 15-Item Test (REY), and the Finger Tapping Test (FTT), were employed.Results Functional motor disorder patients showed low rates of failure on the CIH and REY (7% and 10%, respectively) and slightly higher rates on the FTT (15%, n = 26), which implies a motor task. Their performance was statistically comparable to that of healthy controls but statistically different from that of healthy simulators (p < 0.001). Ninety-three percent of FMD patients, 7% of healthy simulators, and 100% of healthy controls passed at least two of the three tests.Conclusions Performance validity test performance of nonlitigant, non-compensation-seeking patients with FMD ranged from 7% to 15%. Patients' performance was comparable to that of controls and significantly differed from that of simulators. This simple battery of three PVTs could be of practical utility and routinely used in clinical practice.

Here, an exchange field gradient is introduced into perpendicularly magnetized synthetic ferro- and antiferromagnets (SFs and SAFs) through the insertion of a slightly wedged Ru between two thin ferromagnetic layers, which induces field-free switching of perpendicular SFs and SAFs with a switching ratio up to 81% regardless of the nature of the coupling. Temperature-dependent measurement shows a robust field-free switching even at low temperature. The experimental results show that the field-free switching ratio and the effective SOT field are directly related to the exchange field gradient. The theoretical model and numerical simulation indicate that the dynamic noncollinear spin textures induced by the exchange field gradient lead to the field-free switching, while the sign of the exchange field gradient determines the field-free switching polarity. It is further revealed that the SOT efficiency is positively correlated with the antiferromagnetic exchange field for both Ru wedged and non-wedged samples. These results provide a new avenue for simultaneously achieving field-free switching and high SOT efficiency of perpendicularly magnetized SAFs for highly stable, high-density, low-stray-field, and low-power magnetic memory devices.

The main objective of the present study was to better resolve the deep phylogenetic relationships among the main lineages within the family, particularly the relationships between the eight currently recognized subfamilies. We also aimed to confirm the phylogenetic position of the enigmatic genus Calla in relation to the long-debated evolutionary transition between bisexual and unisexual flowers in the family. MethodsNuclear DNA sequence data were generated for 128 species across 111 genera (78%) of Araceae using target sequence capture and the Angiosperms 353 universal probe set. ResultsThe phylogenomic data confirmed the monophyly of the eight Araceae subfamilies, but the phylogenetic position of subfamily Lasioideae remains uncertain. The genus Calla is included in subfamily Aroideae, which has also been expanded to include Zamioculcadoideae. The tribe Aglaonemateae is newly defined to include the genera Aglaonema and Boycea. ConclusionsOur results strongly suggest that new research on African genera (Callopsis, Nephthytis, and Anubias) and Calla will be important for understanding the early evolution of the Aroideae. Also of particular interest are the phylogenetic positions of the isolated genera Montrichardia, Zantedeschia, and Anchomanes, which remain only moderately supported here.

Previous studies indicated that some feature selection methods could improve the performance of Classification-Based Defect Prediction (CBDP) models, and the Correlation-based feature subset selection method with the Best First strategy (CorBF) performed the best. However, the practical benefits of feature selection methods on EADP performance are still unknown, and blindly employing the best-performing CorBF method in CBDP to pre-process the defect datasets may not improve the performance of EADP models but possibly result in performance degradation. To assess the impact of the feature selection techniques on EADP, a total of 24 feature selection methods with 10 classifiers embedded in a state-of-the-art EADP model (CBS+) on the 41 PROMISE defect datasets were examined. We employ six evaluation metrics to assess the performance of EADP models comprehensively. The results show that (1) The impact of the feature selection methods varies in classifiers and datasets. (2) The four wrapper-based feature subset selection methods with forwards search, that is, AdaBoost with Forwards Search, Deep Forest with Forwards Search, Random Forest with Forwards Search, and XGBoost with Forwards Search (XGBF) are better than other methods across the studied classifiers and the used datasets. And XGBF with XGBoost as the embedded classifier in CBS+ performs the best on the datasets. (3) The best-performing CorBF method in CBDP does not perform well on the EADP task. (4) The selected features vary with different feature selection methods and different datasets, and the features noc (number of children), ic (inheritance coupling), cbo (coupling between object classes), and cbm (coupling between methods) are frequently selected by the four wrapper-based feature subset selection methods with forwards search. (5) Using AdaBoost, deep forest, random forest, and XGBoost as the base classifiers embedded in CBS+ can achieve the best performance. In summary, we recommend the software testing team should employ XGBF with XGBoost as the embedded classifier in CBS+ to enhance the EADP performance.

However, the function and molecular mechanisms of SL on coronary artery no-reflow have not been fully elucidated. This study was designed to investigate the contribution of SL extract in repressing excessive mitochondrial autophagy to protect the mitochondrial function and prevent coronary artery no-reflow. The improvement of SL on coronary artery no-reflow was observed in vivo experiments and the molecular mechanisms were further explored through vitro experiments. First, a coronary artery no-reflow rat model was built by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 2 hr of ischemia, followed by 24 hr of reperfusion. Thioflavin S (6%, 1 ml/kg) was injected into the inferior vena cava to mark the no-reflow area. Transmission electron microscopy was performed to observe the cellular structure, mitochondrial structure, and mitochondrial autophagy of the endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the microvascular barrier function and microvascular inflammation. Cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) were isolated from rats. The CMECs were deprived of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 hr and reoxygenated for 4 hr to mimic the Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury-induced coronary artery no-reflow in vitro. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using JC-1 dye. Intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were determined using an ATP assay kit. The cell total reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cell apoptosis rate were analyzed by flow cytometry. Colocalization of mitochondria and lysosomes indirectly indicated mitophagy. The representative ultrastructural morphologies of the autophagosomes and autolysosomes were also observed under transmission electron microscopy. The mitochondrial autophagy-related proteins (LC3II/I, P62, PINK, and Parkin) were analyzed using Western blot analysis. In vivo, results showed that, compared with the model group, SL could reduce the no-reflow area from 37.04 +/- 9.67% to 18.31 +/- 4.01% (1.08 g center dot kg(-1) SL), 13.79 +/- 4.77% (2.16 g center dot kg(-1) SL), and 12.67 +/- 2.47% (4.32 g center dot kg(-1) SL). The extract also significantly increased the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The fluorescence intensities of VE-cadherin, which is a junctional protein that preserves the microvascular barrier function, decreased to similar to 74.05% of the baseline levels in the no-reflow rats and increased to 89.87%(1.08 g center dot kg(-1)SL), 82.23% (2.16 g center dot kg(-1) SL), and 89.69% (4.32 g center dot kg(-1) SL) of the baseline levels by SL treatment. SL administration repressed the neutrophil migration into the myocardium. The oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was induced in vitro to mimic microvascular ischemia-reperfusion injury. The impaired mitochondrial function after OGD/R injury led to decreased ATP production, calcium overload, the excessive opening of the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ROS scavenging ability (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The normal autophagosomes (double-membrane vacuoles with autophagic content) in the sham group were rarely found.The large morphology and autophagosomes were frequently observed in the model group. By contrast, SL inhibited the excessive activation of mitochondrial autophagy. The mitochondrial autophagy regulated by the PINK/Parkin pathway was excessively activated. However, administration of SL prevented the activation of the PINK/Parkin pathway and inhibited excessive mitochondrial autophagy to regulate mitochondrial dysfunction. Results also demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction stimulated endothelial cell barrier dysfunction, but Evans blue transmission was significantly decreased and transmembrane resistance was increased significantly by SL treatment (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Carbonylcyanide-3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) could activate the PINK/Parkin pathway. CCCP reversed the regulation of SL on mitochondrial autophagy and mitochondrial function. SL could alleviate coronary artery no-reflow by protecting the microvasculature by regulating mitochondrial function. The underlying mechanism was related to decreased mitochondrial autophagy by the PINK/Parkin pathway.

The role of the interface to the ferroelectric layer is investigated and discussed, with the main focus directed toward the reliability of the device for non-volatile memory applications. With this investigation, different degradation mechanisms determining electric field cycling and polarization retention are observed, and it is concluded that modifying the bottom interface between the electrode and the ferroelectric layer has the best potential to provide a benefit in device performance.

Taste arbor structural variability analyzed across taste regions	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						geniculate ganglion; morphology; neuron; taste; taste bud	NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; CELLS; BUDS; NEURON; SWEET; NEUROTRANSMISSION; ULTRASTRUCTURE; INNERVATION; SYNAPSES; PATTERNS	Taste ganglion neurons are functionally and molecularly diverse, but until recently morphological diversity was completely unexplored. Specifically, taste arbors (the portion of the neuron within the taste bud) vary in structure, but the reason for this variability is unclear. Here, we analyzed structural variability in taste arbors to determine which factors determine their morphological diversity. To characterize arbor morphology and its relationship to taste bud cells capable of transducing taste stimuli (taste-transducing cell) number and type, we utilized sparse cell genetic labeling of taste ganglion neurons in combination with whole-mount immunohistochemistry. Reconstruction of 151 taste arbors revealed variation in arbor size, complexity, and symmetry. Overall, taste arbors exist on a continuum of complexity, cannot be categorized into discrete morphological groups, and do not have stereotyped endings. Arbor size/complexity was not related to the size of the taste bud in which it was located or the type of taste-transducing cell contacted (membranes within 180 nm). Instead, arbors could be broadly categorized into three groups: large asymmetrical arbors contacting many taste-transducing cells, small symmetrical arbors contacting one or two taste-transducing cells, and unbranched arbors. Neurons with multiple arbors had arbors in more than one of these categories, indicating that this variability is not an intrinsic feature of neuron type. Instead, we speculate that arbor structure is determined primarily by nerve fiber remodeling in response to cell turnover and that large asymmetrical arbors represent a particularly plastic state.

Recent evidence has suggested this effect may be replicable across other conditions. However, it is still unclear whether cognitive reserve applies to alpha-synucleinopathies or to motor outcomes, or if medication confounds effects. This review protocol follows PRISMA-P guidelines and aims to investigate whether cognitive reserve can predict both cognitive and motor outcomes for alpha-synucleinopathy patients. MEDLINE (via PubMed), Scopus, psycINFO (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCO), and Web of Science have been searched. Cross-sectional, cohort, case-control, and longitudinal studies investigating the association between cognitive reserve and cognitive and/or motor outcomes for Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy will be included. Reviewers will independently perform screening, while also extracting data, assessing the risk of bias (using a version of the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool), and rating evidence quality (using GRADE). If possible, random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted for each unique outcome variable and alpha-synucleinopathy; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed. Depending on the number of studies, exploratory analyses may involve meta-regression to assess potential confounding effects. Understanding the broader protective effect of cognitive reserve has significant implications for preventive interventions in the wider population.

Inclusion creates complex classroom situations for mainstream teachers who need to have excellent decision-making skills and the ability to face and resolve ethical dilemmas. College students and pre and in-service teachers were asked about their attitudes towards SEC inclusion, as well as three open-ended dilemmas during vignettes depicting challenging situations in inclusive class forcing decision-making. An online closed and open-ended questionnaire was administered (n = 489). The analysis revealed significant differences in the type of solution to these dilemmas in the three groups. There was a significant interaction between high sensitivity to the feelings of the inclusive students and the participants' overall tendency to support the inclusion of the SECs, positive attitudes towards inclusion, low expression of stigma and a higher sense of self-efficacy. Implications and practical offers are discussed.

LAM's unique cyclic thermal history induces intrinsic heat treatment (IHT) on materials during deposition, which offers an opportunity to develop LAM-customized new materials. This work customized a novel Fe-Ni-Ti-Al maraging steel assisted by machine learning to leverage the IHT effect for in situ forming massive precipitates during LAM without PHT. Fast precipitation kinetics in steel, tailored intermittent deposition strategy, and the IHT effect facilitate the in situ Ni3Ti precipitation in the martensitic matrix via heterogeneous nucleation on high-density dislocations. The as-built steel achieves a tensile strength of 1538 MPa and a uniform elongation of 8.1%, which is superior to a wide range of as-LAM-processed high-strength steel. In the current mainstream ex situ 4D printing, the time-dependent evolutions (i.e., property or functionality changes) of a 3D printed structure occur after part formation. This work highlights in situ 4D printing via the synchronous integration of time-dependent precipitation hardening with 3D geometry shaping, which shows high energy efficiency and sustainability. The findings provide insight into developing LAM-customized materials by understanding and utilizing the IHT-materials interaction.

AimIn order to address this question, our goal was to determine the predictive power of previously taught operations on newly taught ones above general cognitive skills and basic numerical skills. SamplesMore than one hundred children in each school level from Grades 2 to 5 from various socio-cultural environments (N = 435, 229 girls) were tested. MethodsChildren were assessed on their abilities to solve the four basic arithmetic operations. They were also tested on their general cognitive abilities, including working memory, executive functions (i.e., inhibition and flexibility), visual attention and language. Finally, their basic numerical skills were measured through a matching task between symbolic and nonsymbolic numerosity representations. Additions and subtractions were presented to children from Grade 2, multiplications from Grade 3 and divisions from Grade 4. Results and ConclusionsWe show that addition predicts subtraction and multiplication performance in all grades. Moreover, multiplication predicts division performance in both Grades 4 and 5. Finally, addition predicts division in Grade 4 but not in Grade 5 and subtraction and division are not related whatever the school grade. These results are examined considering the existing literature, and their implications in terms of instruction are discussed.

Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after MI has been recognized as a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Thus, prevention of fibrosis or alleviation of fibrosis progression is important for cardiac repair. To this end, a biocompatible microneedle (MN) patch based on gelatin is fabricated to load exosomes containing microRNA-29b (miR-29b) mimics with antifibrotic activity to prevent excessive cardiac fibrosis after MI. Exosomes are isolated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and loaded with miR-29b mimics via electroporation, which can be internalized effectively in cardiac fibroblasts to upregulate the expression of miR-29b and downregulate the expression of fibrosis-related proteins. After being implanted in the infarcted heart of a mouse MI model, the MN patch can increase the retention of loaded exosomes in the infarcted myocardium, leading to alleviation of inflammation, reduction of the infarct size, inhibition of fibrosis, and improvement of cardiac function. This design explored the MN patch as a suitable platform to deliver exosomes containing antifibrotic biomolecules locally for the prevention of cardiac fibrosis, showing the potential for MI treatment in clinical applications.

In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in the low- and high-temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high-performance TE materials working in the mid-temperature range (400-700 K). Herein, p-type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co-doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zT(max)) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zT(ave)) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300-673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n-type Ag2Te, and ahighly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single-leg device with efficiencies up to 13.3% and a unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high-performance TE material in the mid-temperature range.

Previous research has described the high costs of college integration for underprivileged students, which in turn, negatively impact academic performance and general wellbeing. These studies tend to concentrate on cultural capital costs, such as catching up with assumed middle-class or elite capital and dealing with two worlds. Less has been said about social capital costs, the costs of making friends, especially more privileged friends. Through 61 in-depth interviews with various types of students as part of a broader ethnographic fieldwork, this article analyses the experiences of low-income scholarship holders in an elite institution in a very unequal society, Colombia. Rather than isolating themselves or resorting to safe homophilic relations, they faced their new elite environment engaging with the hidden relational cost of making friends with more affluent students. In so doing, they had to overcome fears and experiences of discrimination and micro-aggressions, as well as cultural and economic capital barriers, and employed either camouflaging or disclosure strategies, sometimes becoming culturally and socially omnivorous. Symbolic belonging to the institution and the acquisition of middle-class cultural capital were among the benefits that made overcoming the costs worthy. Our results shed light on what institutions can do to reduce the costs for underprivileged students and, theoretically, unveil an important mechanism and barrier for social mobility: building cross-class ties.

Solid-State Field-Assisted Ion Exchange (Ag → Na) in Soda-Lime Float Glass: Tin Versus Air Side	ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						electric field; glasses; ion exchange; silver nanoparticles	SILVER NANOPARTICLES; SILICATE GLASS; WAVE-GUIDES; RAMAN-SCATTERING; NANOCLUSTERS; CLUSTERS; FILMS; SIZE; DIFFUSION; RESONANCE	The application of a DC current allows fast (few minutes) Ag+ -> Na+ ion exchange in soda-lime-silicate (SLS) glass. The effect of processing parameters, electric current, and treating time is studied on both air and tin sides of SLS float glass, and non-Fickian diffusion is revealed. It is shown that ion exchange kinetics are similar on both sides and the tempering process results in similar mechanical properties (crack formation probability after Vickers indentation, hardness, and Young's modulus). However, the structure/microstructure of the tin and air sides is hugely different. In particular, clear silver nanoclustering takes place on the tin side, resulting in approximate to 8 nm metallic particles in the vicinity of the surface. The formation of nanoparticles is also coupled with a deep structural reorganization of the amorphous network and the Q(n) units. The nanoparticles' size decreases moving from the surface to the interior of the glass. Silver nanoparticles are also detected on the air side, although their density and size are largely reduced. Whereas the mechanical properties measured on the air and tin side are similar, significative differences are observed in terms of optical properties.

Nanovaccines Displaying the Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin in an Inverted Orientation Elicit an Enhanced Stalk-Directed Antibody Response	ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS			English	Article						hemagglutinin; influenza; vaccines	BROADLY NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; STEM; IMMUNODOMINANCE; PARTICLES; DOMAIN	Despite the availability of licensed vaccines, influenza causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current influenza vaccines elicit an immune response that primarily targets the head domain of the viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA). Influenza viruses, however, readily evade this response by acquiring mutations in the head domain. While vaccines that target the more conserved HA stalk may circumvent this problem, low levels of antistalk antibodies are elicited by vaccination, possibly due to the poor accessibility of the stalk domain to B cell receptors. In this work, it is demonstrated that nanoparticles presenting HA in an inverted orientation generate tenfold higher antistalk antibody titers after a prime immunization and fivefold higher antistalk titers after a boost than nanoparticles displaying HA in its regular orientation. Moreover, nanoparticles presenting HA in an inverted orientation elicit a broader antistalk response that reduces mouse weight loss and improves survival after challenge to a greater extent than nanoparticles displaying HA in a regular orientation. Refocusing the antibody response toward conserved epitopes by controlling antigen orientation may enable the design of broadly protective nanovaccines targeting influenza viruses and other pathogens with pandemic potential.

Herein, a dynamic membrane-active glycopeptide is developed by grafting with 25% maltotriose and 50% p-benzyl alcohol for the first time to effectively facilitate entry of membrane-impermeable trehalose in human RBCs with low hemolysis. Results of the mechanism acting on cell membranes suggest that reversible adsorption of such benzyl alcohol-grafted glycopeptide on cell surfaces upon weak perturbation with phospholipids and dynamic transition toward membrane stabilization are essential for keeping cellular biofunctions. Furthermore, the functionalized glycopeptide is indicative of typical alpha-helical/beta-sheet structure-driven regulations of ice crystals during freeze-thaw, thereby strongly promoting efficient cryopreservation. Such all-in-one glycopeptide enables achieving both high cell recovery post-thaw >85% and exceptional cryosurvival >95% in direct freezing protocols. The rationally designed benzyl alcohol-modified glycopeptide permits the development of a competent platform with high generality for protection of blood cells against freeze-stress.

Herein, an injectable sericin (SS)/silk fibroin (SF) recombinant hydrogel, termed SF-SS-SMC hydrogel, is developed to enable local delivery of anti-CD47 antibody (alpha CD47). The hydrogel displays self-reinforcement in high H2O2 concentration of tumor microenvironment (TME), as the SS/Fe2+ supramolecular nanocomplex (SS-SMC) inside the hydrogel converts H2O2 to reactive oxygen species (ROS), further triggering additional crosslinking among the SF polymers. Therefore, the SF-SS-SMC hydrogel has an in vivo retention time longer than 21 days and acts as a reservoir for the long-term sustained release of alpha CD47. More importantly, the SF-SS-SMC hydrogel itself efficiently regulates the remodeling of a protumor immunosuppressive TME to an antitumoral TME through switching of tumor-associated macrophages from an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype to a proinflammatory M1 phenotype without additional drugs. Based on the combined effect of sustained alpha CD47 release and TME reprogramming, the SF-SS-SMC hydrogel has satisfactory immunotherapeutic effects in the treatment of local, abscopal, remitting, and metastatic tumors. Further advantages, including low cost of production, simple fabrication, and ease of use, make it promising for commercial mass production.

The results show that the seasonal O-3 concentration variation is spring > summer > autumn > winter; relative humidity, temperature and wind speed are the main meteorological drivers of O-3 pollution; the cross-regional transport of high O-3 concentrations and precursors from the south and southwest has a strong influence on the local O-3 concentration; Pudong New Area is in the "VOCs control zone " during the O-3 pollution period in May. Therefore, it is important to control the production and emission of local VOCs and to strengthen the synergistic control of O-3 and its precursors between regions for the control of spring O-3 in Pudong New Area.

However, most studies of sexual minority adolescents analyze this population as a homogeneous group rather than attending to plausible differences between plurisexual and monosexual sexual minority youth. This study examined whether plurisexual Latinx youth differed from monosexual youth on three facets of sexual orientation identity (SOI) development (exploration, resolution, and affirmation). Further, we examined whether plurisexual (vs. monosexual) identity moderated the relationship between SOI development and depressive symptoms and self-esteem. MethodsThe sample included 365 Latinx sexual minority youth (14-24 years) living in the United States or US Territory. The majority of participants identified as monosexual (84.1%); 15.9% were plurisexual. The sample was 75.6% male, 19.5% female, and 2.0% transgender. Participants were asked to complete an online, cross-sectional survey that asked questions pertaining to ethnicity and sexual orientation. This data was collected in the fall of 2014. ResultsLatinx plurisexual youth had higher levels of SOI affirmation, exploration, and resolution than monosexual youth. SOI affirmation and exploration and were positively associated with self-esteem for all youth. SOI affirmation was significantly negatively associated with depressive symptoms for monosexual youth but not for plurisexual youth. SOI exploration and resolution were not significantly associated with depressive symptoms. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that there are significant differences between plurisexual and monosexual Latinx adolescent populations in reference to identity affirmation, exploration, and resolution, and that these sexual orientations should be treated distinctly in future research. In addition, all three aspects of identity development were significantly related to higher self-esteem for all youth regardless of identity, providing evidence for the importance of developing these three factors.

I demonstrate how capital taxation, if optimal, drives a wedge between the market costs of carbon (the net present value of marginal damages using the market interest rate) and the Pigouvian tax (the net present value of marginal damages using the consumption discount rate of successive OLGs). In contrast to deterministic infinitely lived representative agent models, at the optimum, the capital income tax is positive, the carbon price equals the market costs of carbon but it falls short of the Pigouvian tax when (i) preferences are not separable over consumption and leisure; and (ii) labor income taxes cannot be age-dependent. I also show that restrictions on climate change policy provide a novel rationale for positive capital income taxes.

However, the origin of such signals remains unknown, which hinders the widespread use of electrochemical methods for cellular research. In this study, the authors found that intracellular metabolic pathways that generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are the main contributors to extracellularly detectable electrochemical signals. This is achieved through the detection of living cells (4,706 cells/chip, linearity: 0.985) at a linear range of 7,466-48,866. Based on this discovery, the authors demonstrated that the cellular signals detected by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) can be rapidly amplified with a developed medium containing metabolic activator cocktails (MACs). The DPV approach combined with MAC treatment shows a remarkable performance to detect the effects of the anticancer drug CPI-613 on cervical cancer both at a low drug concentration (2 mu m) and an extremely short treatment time (1 hour). Furthermore, the senescence of mesenchymal stem cells could also be sensitively quantified using the DPV+MAC method even at a low passage number (P6). Collectively, their findings unveiled the origin of redox signals in living cells, which has important implications for the characterization of various cellular functions and behaviors using electrochemical approaches.

Most of intense RREs with the maximum rainfall intensity about 20-60 mm.h(-1) and the lifetime shorter than 24 h have the primary rainfall peak from noon to afternoon. Based on the rainfall pattern at 3 h prior to the events start, the intense RREs can be classified into two groups that one is southeastward propagation mode originating from the northwestern mountains of PRD and another is coastal mode from South China Sea (SCS). During the premonsoon-onset period, the first type of RREs is the main mode causing the heavy rain in the cities of the inland region owing to the anomalous cold air from north confronting the wet and warm air from south with the increased southwesterly winds resulting in the strengthening frontal zone and moisture convergence. After the summer monsoon onset, the main rainfall pattern changes to the coastal mode having the significant impact on the coastal cities. The obvious anomalous cyclonic circulation related with the increased moisture convergence in the coastal regions providing the favourable conditions of the convection initiation and development. The study of the characteristics and evolution process of preceding intense RREs can improve the forecasting skills and reduce the risk of urban inundation.

In continuation of this study, analogous nickel(II) and cobalt(III) complexes were synthesized and tested in HL-60 leukemia, and cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant A2780 ovarian cancer cell lines. The biological activity depended on the extent of cellular uptake and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inactive [(Ni(II)SAP] complexes (1-3) only marginally accumulated in tumor cells and did not induce ROS. The cellular uptake of [Co(III)SAP]Cl complexes (4-6) into the cells depended on the length of the ester alkyl chain (ethyl, 4 < propyl, 5 < butyl, 6). The cytotoxicity correlated with the presence of ROS. The low cytotoxic complex 4 induced only few ROS, while 5 and 6 caused a good to outstanding antiproliferative activity, exerted high ROS generation, and induced cell death after 48 h. Necrostatin-1 prevented the biological effects, proving necroptosis as part of the mode of action. Interestingly, the effects of 5 and 6 were not reversed by Ferrostatin-1, but even enhanced upon simultaneous application to the tumor cells.

Materials and MethodsTwenty subjects in need of an implant-borne restoration were randomly assigned to receive either a cement-retained (CRR) or a screw-retained (SRR) implant-supported monolithic lithium disilicate (LS2) reconstruction. Each patient received a titanium implant with in internal conic connection. After osseointegration and second-stage surgery, healing abutments were placed for about 10 days. The type of restoration (CRR vs. SRR) was randomly assigned, and the restorations were manufactured of monolithic LS2. Both types of restorations, CRR and SRR, were based on a titanium component (Ti-base) that was bonded to the abutment (CRR) or the crown (SRR). The follow-up period for all restoration was 36 months. Clinical outcome was evaluated according to Functional Implant Prosthetic Score (FIPS). Quality of live (OHIP) and patient's satisfaction were assessed using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Primary endpoint was loss of restoration for any reason. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed and log-rank testing was performed (p < .05). ResultsOne restoration of group CRR failed after 6 months due to loss of adhesion between Ti-base and individual abutment. No further biological or technical failures occurred. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference between both treatment options (p = .317). There was no statistically significant difference between both types of restoration, neither for FIPS, OHIP, treatment time nor patient satisfaction (p > .05). ConclusionMonolithic hybrid abutment crowns (screw-retained) and monolithic hybrid abutment with adhesively cemented monolithic crowns using lithium disilicate showed no statistically significant difference for implant-based reconstructions in this pilot RCT setting.

(topically to heal wounds). In this study, Pickering sponges containing HPO have been stabilized using beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) natural substance while Polyvinyl alcohol/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PVA/CMC) polymer matrices. The beta-CD/HPO inclusion complexes were added to the PVA/CMC sponges in various ratios (1 : 1, 1 : 4, and 1 : 8) and morphological, thermal and physical properties of sponges were investigated based on the ratios. SEM images revealed all Pickering PVA/CMC/HPO sponges has good porosity and PVA/CMC sponges containing (1 : 8 w/v) of beta-CD/HPO indicated the highest porosity. Furthermore, existence of HPO in the sponges were confirmed by FT-IR analysis. Similarly, thermal stability is increased as the beta-CD/HPO increased. Contact angle value rise from 12.7 degrees to 89.9 degrees as HPO concentration increased, and this value is the ideal hydrophobicity for the skin. Antibacterial efficiency showed good antibacterial activities of Pickering sponges containing the highest amount of HPO (1 : 8 w/v of beta-CD/HPO) against Gram (-) (Escherichia coli), and Gram (+) (Staphylococcus aureus, P. aeruginosa) bacteria with 13-17 mm zone inhibition diameter. All samples showed biocompatibility, and the material with the lowest amount of HPO (1 : 1 w/v of beta-CD/HPO) having the best biocompatibility. The increase in the HPO amount in Pickering sponges caused a decrease in mechanical properties. As a result, the resulting PVA/CMC/HPO Pickering sponges can be utilized in wound dressing applications owing to their imroved antibacterial activity results.

In order to understand the women and improve their quality of life, the aim of this study was to investigate life satisfaction, body image and associated factors among Swedish women with breast cancer after mastectomy. MethodsThis descriptive cross-sectional study enrolled 481 Swedish women with breast cancer after mastectomy who completed a questionnaire comprising socio-demographic characteristics, sources of information, and life satisfaction and body image (outcome variables). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate relationships between socio-demographic characteristics, information support, sources of information, treatment variables, and outcome variables. ResultsAll dimensions of life satisfaction were associated with body image. Treatment options were factors associated with life satisfaction, while sources of information were a factor that increased life satisfaction in the dimensions of physical symptoms, sickness impact and quality of close-friend relationship. Underlying disease, age 31-45 years, chemotherapy and breast reconstruction increased body image dissatisfaction. ConclusionThe finding that some socio-demographic characteristics, treatment options and sources of information were associated with life dissatisfaction and body image dissatisfaction can increase healthcare professionals' understanding of women with breast cancer after treatment. They should provide accurate and realistic information, focus attention on the women's needs, and prepare psychological intervention programs that make the women cope with their life situations during follow-up care.

Modelling potential biotope composition on a regional scale revealed that climate variables are stronger drivers than soil variables	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Bavaria; biotope distribution; distribution modelling; Maxent; species distribution model	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; NATURAL VEGETATION; PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE; FOREST COMMUNITIES; SAMPLE-SIZE; ACCURACY; HABITAT; PREVALENCE; IMPACTS	Aim: Environmental conditions define the suitability of an area for biotopes, and any area can be suitable for several biotopes. However, most previous studies modelled the distribution of single biotopes ignoring the potential co-occurrence of biotopes in one area, which limits the usefulness of such models for conservation and restoration planning. In this study, we described the potential biotope composition of an area in response to environmental conditions.Location: Bavaria, Federal State of Germany.Methods: Based on the Bavarian biotope mapping data, we modelled the distribution of 29 terrestrial biotopes based on six climate variables and six chemical and four physical soil properties using the species distribution modelling algorithm Maxent.Results: For most biotopes, we found that climate variables were more important than soil variables for the biotope distribution and that the area of the predicted biotope distribution was larger than the observed distribution. The potential biotope composition illustrated that while 8% of the area in Bavaria was not sufficiently suitable for any analysed biotope, 92% of the modelled area in Bavaria was suitable for at least one biotope, 84% for two and 77% for at least three biotopes. The difference in suitability between the most suitable biotopes in composition was minor. Further, over one-quarter of the modelled area was suitable for 6-8 different biotopes.Main Conclusions: Our study showed that considering a composition of potentially suitable biotopes in a raster cell, instead of only the most suitable biotope, provides valuable information to identify conservation priorities and restoration opportunities.

Identification of micrognathia by prenatal ultrasound may improve timely diagnosis and management of infants with Robin sequence	PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS			English	Article; Early Access							INTERVENTIONS; CHILDREN	Objective: Robin sequence (RS) is a craniofacial anomaly characterized by small jaw (micrognathia) with associated tongue base airway obstruction. With advances in fetal imaging, micrognathia may be detected prenatally. This study aims to determine if prenatal recognition of micrognathia offers any advantage over being unaware of the condition until after delivery and to assess if prenatal consultation for micrognathia adds benefits beyond merely noting the presence of the condition. Method: Retrospective chart review examining cases from 01/01/2010 to 12/31/ 2020 at an urban tertiary medical center. Results: Forty seven infants with RS were included. 40.4% (n = 19) had micrognathia/retrognathia noted on prenatal ultrasound. 47.4% (n = 9) of those 19 pregnancies saw a maternal fetal medicine (MFM) program with craniofacial consultation. Compared to 28 infants not diagnosed with micrognathia until after birth, the 19 infants identified prenatally required fewer transfers from birth hospital (p = 0.02). Additionally, those referred to MFM with craniofacial consultation had shorter lengths of stay when airway intervention was required (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Prenatal recognition of micrognathia may lead to early detection and management of RS. When RS is suspected, prenatal consultation with MFM and craniofacial team may further optimize care of the infant following delivery. Key points Robin sequence (RS) in newborns may require interventions and prolonged hospital stay to address airway concerns and failure to thrive To our knowledge, no study has assessed differences in outcomes between infants diagnosed with RS prenatally and those that were not This study suggests a possible relationship between early identification of RS and fewer hospital transfers as well as a shorter length of hospital stay after birth.

Inspired by the highway anti-glare panels, wind energy harvesting triboelectric nanogenerator (AG-TENG) arrays to properly capture energy from highway moving vehicles is developed. A single AG-TENG installation module can achieve a high power density of 0.2 Wm(-2) at a wind speed of 3 m s(-1). This wind speed is too low to drive conventional wind energy harvesting equipment. The performance of the AG-TENG shows no degradation after 80 h of continuous operation (1 440 000 times). Thus, with the rational consideration and features, the system can generate enough power to drive internet of things (IoT) devices and environmental sensors, as well as offer wireless alarming and radio frequency identification vehicle monitoring. This study provides a promising strategy to properly harvest wind energy on highways using existing infrastructures under the condition of even no natural wind, showing broad application prospects in distributed environmental monitoring, intelligent highways, and the IoT.

While large-scale data storage and random access have been achieved in DNA oligonucleotide pools, repeated data accessing requires constant data replenishment, and these implementations are confined in professional facilities. Here, a mobile data storage system in the genome of the extremophile Halomonas bluephagenesis, which enables dual-mode storage, dynamic data maintenance, rapid readout, and robust recovery. The system relies on two key components: A versatile genetic toolbox for the integration of 10-100 kb scale synthetic DNA into H. bluephagenesis genome and an efficient error correction coding scheme targeting noisy nanopore sequencing reads. The storage and repeated retrieval of 5 KB data under non-laboratory conditions are demonstrated. The work highlights the potential of DNA data storage in domestic and field scenarios, and expands its application domain from archival data to frequently accessed data.

The TLR9 activation prompted us to treat patients with corticosteroids in acute conditions. In patients with LPIN1 mutations, RM and at-risk situations that can trigger RM have been treated in a uniform manner. Since 2015, these patients have also received intravenous corticosteroids. We retrospectively compared data on hospital stays by corticosteroid-treated patients vs. patients not treated with corticosteroids. Nineteen patients were hospitalized. The median number of admissions per patient was 21 overall and did not differ when comparing the 10 corticosteroid-treated patients with the 9 patients not treated with corticosteroids. Four patients in the non-corticosteroid group died during a RM (mean age at death: 5.6 years). There were no deaths in the corticosteroid group. The two groups did not differ significantly in the number of RM episodes. However, for the six patients who had RM and occasionally been treated with corticosteroids, the median number of RM episodes was significantly lower when intravenous steroids had been administered. The peak plasma creatine kinase level and the area under the curve were or tended to be higher in patients treated with corticosteroids-even after the exclusion of deceased patients or focusing on the period after 2015. The median length of stay (10 days overall) was significantly longer for corticosteroid-treated patients but was similar after the exclusion of deceased patients. The absence of deaths and the higher severity of RM observed among corticosteroid-treated patients could suggest that corticotherapy is associated with greater survival.

ALR2 is part of the rate-limiting step, which is associated with diabetic complications in this process, and plays a role in regulating reactive oxygen species induced by growth factors and cytokines. Despite the fact that sulfides and sulfones have been discovered to have a variety of other biological functions, in the current study, we assessed the ALR2 inhibitory potential of the derivatives of bis-sulfide (5 a-i) and bis-sulfone (6 a-i) in order to further our interest in designing and discovering powerful ALR2 inhibitors. The results of the biological investigations showed that all of the derivatives exhibit activity against ALR2, with K-I values ranging from 0.53 +/- 0.03 to 4.20 +/- 0.06 mu M. Among these agents, 2,6-bis((4-chlorophenyl)(phenylthio)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one (5 h), 2,6-bis((3-nitrophenyl)(phenylthio)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one (5 c), and 2,6-bis((3-chlorophenyl)(phenylthio)methyl)cyclohexan-1-one (5 g) exhibited prominent inhibitory activity with K-I constants of 0.53 +/- 0.03 mu M, 0.65 +/- 0.04 mu M, and 0.71 +/- 0.05 mu M, respectively, against ALR2 and were found to be more potent than epalrestat (K-I=0.79 +/- 0.01 mu M) is currently, the only ALR2 inhibitor (ALR2I) utilized in treatment. Additionally, in silico molecular docking experiments were carried out to explain how these bis-sulfides (5 a-i) and bis-sulfones (6 a-i) interacted with the target enzyme ALR2 ' s binding site. According to the ADME-Tox study, these compounds are predicted to be ALR2Is with appropriate drug-like characteristics.

Current patterns of care in low-risk thyroid cancer-A national cross-sectional survey of Australian thyroid clinicians	ENDOCRINOLOGY DIABETES & METABOLISM			English	Article						thyroid cancer; health-related quality of life; thyroidectomy; cancer survivorship; fear of cancer recurrence; multi-disciplinary team	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES; FOLLOW-UP; MANAGEMENT; RECURRENCE; CARCINOMA; FEAR; SURVIVAL	Introduction: De-escalated treatment of hemithyroidectomy without radioactive iodine (RAI) is now accepted for patients with low-risk, well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC). The benefit of long-term follow-up care remains controversial. This study aims to describe parameters associated with less than total thyroidectomy, and discharge from specialist follow-up in patients with low-risk WDTC in Australia.Methods: An online survey was distributed to Australian members of Endocrine Society of Australia, Australian and New Zealand Endocrine Surgeons, and Australian Society of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery. Clinicians completed a survey of management and follow-up care preferences for four clinical vignettes (all low-risk WDTC).Results: 119 clinicians (48% endocrinologists, 55% male) answered at least one question. The majority (59%) of respondents recommended less than total thyroidectomy and omission of RAI in patients with WDTC < 2 cm. Most (62%) would discharge a patient with micropapillary thyroid cancer within 1 year following total thyroidectomy. In contrast, for WDTC 1-4 cm, > 90% of clinicians would continue specialist follow-up for at least 5 years. The majority of clinicians felt that patients experienced disproportionate fear of recurrence and were reassured by follow-up. After multivariable analysis, clinicians who participated in multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) were more likely to choose de-escalated care for both initial treatment (p = .005) and follow-up care (> 5 years, p = .05).Conclusion: Clinician attitudes captured by this survey reflect recent changes in guidelines towards hemithyroidectomy for low-risk WDTC, particularly amongst MDT attendees. There is a need to further examine the impact of de-escalated care on fear of recurrence and quality of life in thyroid cancer survivors.

ObjectiveWe aimed to explore the association between ICIs and hepatic failure and characterize the clinical features of ICI-associated hepatic failure in the pharmacovigilance database. MethodsData from the first quarter (Q1) of 2015 to the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021 in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database were retrieved for disproportionality and Bayesian analysis. Reporting odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to evaluate correlations between ICIs and hepatic failure. ResultsHepatic failure occurred in 0.19% (18,454/9,647,655) of all cases in the FAERS database, of which 654 cases were associated with ICIs. The overall median time from ICIs initiation to hepatic failure onset was 38 days, 72.3% of the adverse events occurred within the first 3 months, and 68.65% of the cases died after developing hepatic failure. In general, a strong signal was shown between ICIs and hepatic failure (ROR025 = 2.70, IC025 = 1.39). For the three categories of ICIs, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors (ROR025 = 3.09, IC025 = 1.57) had a higher risk signal than programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitors. For monotherapy, atezolizumab showed the strongest risk signal (ROR025 = 4.07, IC025 = 1.90). The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed stronger signals of hepatic failure compared with nivolumab or ipilimumab alone (nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab: ROR025 = 1.40, IC025 = 0.16; nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. nivolumab: ROR025 = 1.24, IC025 = 0.34). Considering the concomitant agents used with ICIs, the majority of these regimens showed stronger signals than ICI monotherapy, such as acetaminophen (ICIs + acetaminophen vs. ICIs: ROR025 = 1.06, IC025 = 0.32). ConclusionsICIs had possible strong signals associated with hepatic failure, and most cases of hepatic failure occurred within the first 3 months and had poor outcomes, which should attract clinical attention.

J	Al Abdulwahid, A				Al Abdulwahid, Abdulwahid			Software solution for text summarisation using machine learning based Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers algorithm	IET SOFTWARE			English	Article						learning (artificial intelligence); natural language processing; neural nets; software engineering; software maintenance; text analysis	ENSEMBLE; MODEL	The data science has evolved over the past 2 decades, allowing the technical norms to be built in a way that can handle the new issues. While various technical issues develop, the requirement for text summary has always been there. Nearly 10 years ago, the foundation of automatic text summarisation was created, and since then, technical improvements and refinements have been made for large-scale big data handling, crime investigation, and cybersecurity, to name a few. There are several text summarising techniques, and these influence the outcomes as well. Another difference from the last 20 years is the requirement for time for text summarising. To pursue acquiring the findings, machine learning methods are applied to the core set of text phrases as a data set. Neural networks are now being used to improve text summarisation. But because there is more data available as short text to summarise, there will also be a big need for short text summarising. Utilising a quick summarising technique, accuracy, precision, and memory are improved. The focus of the challenge in this work is on brief text summarisation and boosting accuracy using a cutting-edge algorithm called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with transformer produced outstanding results for Short Text Summarisation. The model receives the input and performs a sequence-to-sequence analysis of the data down to the word level. The model's implementation is then contrasted with Word2Vec + RNN and Word2Vec + long short-term memory (LSTM), two earlier works. The proposed strategy, which seeks to increase the training data duration and accuracy for short text summarisation, produced best results utilising BERT + LSTM and BERT + Transformer. Using a confusion matrix to monitor and analyse the improved findings, it was shown that BERT + Transformer had an accuracy of 97%. The suggested model also performs better than existing models in terms of precision (46%), and recall (30%).

The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents diagnostic and therapeutic drugs from penetrating and working in GBM. In traditional surgical treatment, it is difficult to completely distinguish the boundary between tumor and surrounding normal tissue, resulting in incomplete resection of tumor. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of GBM are very challenging. Several molecular probes and nanoprobes have been reported to successfully penetrate the BBB, selectively target and accumulate in GBM to achieve in situ imaging of brain tumors, thus achieving accurate diagnosis and treatment of orthotopic or non-orthotopic GBM. This paper reviews the advances of molecular probes and nanoprobes in image-guided diagnosis and treatment of GBM. The design principle, application, and advantages of each probe are enumerated in detail. Finally, the prospects and potential challenges of probes in the diagnosis and treatment of GBM are discussed with a view to further promote the study and application of novel imaging probes in GBM.

Great advancements have been achieved through manipulating intermolecular interactions for high-performance UOP materials in recent years. This review will discuss the influence of various intermolecular interactions, including pi-pi interactions, n-pi interactions, halogen bonding, hydrogen bonding, coordinative bonding, and ionic bonding on phosphorescent properties at room temperature, respectively. We summarize the rule of manipulating intermolecular interactions for UOP materials with superior phosphorescent properties. This review will provide a guideline for developing new UOP materials with superior phosphorescent properties for potential applications in organic electronics and bioelectronics.

They are characterized by enzyme-like, highly confined active site and high acidity, which underlie their wide-reaching applications as Bronsted acid catalysts and as precatalysts for silylium Lewis acids. Many carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation reactions that were deemed intractable could now be attained with spectacular reactivity and selectivity. Substrates that are small, unbiased and/or possess insufficient reactivity such as simple alkenes could now be engaged. The high structural confinement is particularly invaluable to control stereo- and chemoselectivity. The well-defined steric environment offers unique opportunity to control high-energy but structurally unbiased cation intermediates such as the norbonyl cations. Beyond practical appeals such as good scalability as well as ease and modularity of preparation, the extremely low pre-catalyst loadings required to achieve high turnover and stereoselectivity have also come to define a new frontier in organocatalysis.

Coherent Random Lasing in Subwavelength Quasi-2D Perovskites	LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS			English	Article; Early Access						coherent feedback; quasi-2D perovskite; random lasers	REPLICA SYMMETRY-BREAKING; RANDOM BIT GENERATION; RANDOM LASERS; LEVY STATISTICS; LIGHT; EMISSION	Quasi-2D lead halide perovskites have garnered increasing interest as lasing gain media. Relatively simple fabrication, high refractive index, and unique quantum well structure encourage their use in traditional cavity lasers and cavity-free systems called random lasers (RLs). Despite tremendous advances reported thus far, coherent random lasing in quasi-2D perovskite subwavelength films has not been reported. Consequently, coherent optical feedback mechanisms in quasi-2D perovskite systems are still unexplored. Here, this work reports the observation of coherent random lasing in subwavelength quasi-2D perovskite films. Statistical analysis of spectral measurements reveals Levy-like intensity fluctuations, replica symmetry breaking confirms random lasing, and the coherent modes are studied with spectral and spatial correlation techniques. The observed coherent lasing modes are found to be extended states that arise from the random crystal grain structure during fabrication and span the entire pump volume. These modes out-compete diffusive lasing due to their coherence.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) act as refuge for cancer cells in PDAC. Mechanisms of intracelluar communication between CAFs and cancer cells need to be explored. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the modulation of oncogenesis and tumor progression of PDAC; however, specific lncRNAs and their mechanism of action have not been clarified clearly in tumoral microenvironment. This work aims to identify novel lncRNAs involved in cellular interaction between cancer cells and CAFs in PDAC. To this end, differentially expressed lncRNAs between long-term and short-term survival PDAC patients are screened. Lnc-FSD2-31:1 is found to be significantly increased in long-term survival patients. This work then discovers that tumor-derived lnc-FSD2-31:1 restrains CAFs activation via miR-4736 transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, EVs-derived miR-4736 suppresses autophagy and contributes to CAFs activation by targeting ATG7. Furthermore, blocking miR-4736 suppresses tumor growth in genetically engineered KPC (LSL-KrasG12D/+, LSL-Trp53R172H/+, and Pdx-1-Cre) mouse model of PDAC. This study demonstrates that intratumoral lnc-FSD2-31:1 modulates autophagy in CAFs resulting in their activation through EVs-derived miR-4736. Targeting miR-4736 may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for PDAC.

Unlike the augmented Kalman filter (AKF), the proposed filter falls within the category of Bayesian filters in which unknown inputs are estimated without attributing any fictitious input model or statistics. Also, in contrast with the existing algorithms in the latter category, such as the Gillijns and De Moor Filters (GDFs), the developed filter applies to systems with and without direct feedthrough, in particular, systems with a rank-deficient feedforward matrix. Because of the latter features, the filter is referred to as universal filter (UF) for convenience. The numerical examples show that the UF performs better than the AKF. Due to its structure, the UF does not require the tuning of the hyperparameters for inputs, and therefore the problematic instability of the AKF is not encountered in the case of a large modeling error variance of the input. For systems with direct feedthrough, the error and covariance propagation terms differ due to the distinct state space. Consequently, the UF can enhance estimations due to the well-conditionedness of the relevant inversion problem. Moreover, the UF can deal with systems with rank-deficient feedforward matrix where these systems are not covered by GDFs.

Those with lymphovascular and distal metastasis were excluded before ESD. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed to obtain information regarding patient demographics, clinicopathological characteristics, tumor features, complete resection rate, and complications, etc. All patients underwent follow-up for at least 12 months to evaluate any local recurrence or distant metastasis.Results: A total of 15 patients with an average age of 56.9 +/- 10.7 years were recruited, including 11 men and 4 women. Lesions were found at the upper third (13 [86.7%]) or middle third (2 [13.3%]) of the stomach. The average lesion size was 9.1 +/- 4.8 mm. Macroscopically, lesions presented as a flat elevated type with reddish or erosion on top (n = 7, 46.7%), depressed type with pale color (n = 5, 33.3%), or submucosal tumor (SMT)-like appearance type (n = 3, 20.0%). En bloc resection, complete resection and curative resection were achieved in 14 (93.3%), 13 (86.7%), and 11 (73.3%) patients, respectively. Nine (60.0%) of the lesions had submucosal invasion. One patient underwent additional surgery. No local recurrence or metastasis was detected during the follow-up duration.Conclusions: GA-FGs present with various endoscopic features. ESD appears to be effective and safe for treating early-stage GA-FGs.

Watching with Argus eyes: Characterization of emotional and physiological responding in adults exposed to childhood maltreatment and/or recent adversity	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						affective startle modulation; childhood maltreatment; electromyographic startle responding; EMG; recent adversity; SCR; skin conductance response	POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; NEURAL DEVELOPMENT DEPRIVATION; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; IMPAIRED FEAR INHIBITION; LIFE EVENTS; RETROSPECTIVE REPORTS; ACOUSTIC STARTLE; BRAIN STRUCTURE; EXPERIENCES; REACTIVITY	Exposure to adverse experiences is a well-established major risk factor for affective psychopathology. The vulnerability of deleterious sequelae is assumed in maladaptive processes of the defensive system, particularly in emotional processing. More specifically, childhood maltreatment has been suggested to be associated with the recruitment of specific and distinct defensive response profiles. To date, it remains unclear whether these are specific or generalizable to recent adversity in adulthood. This pre-registered study aimed to investigate the impact of exposure to childhood and recent adversity on emotional processing in 685 healthy adults with the "Affective Startle Modulation" Paradigm (ASM). First, we replicated higher trait anxiety and depression levels in individuals exposed to both types of adversity. Second, we observed increased general skin conductance reactivity in individuals exposed to recent adversity. Third, individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment showed reduced, while individuals exposed to recent adversity showed increased discrimination between pictures of negative and neutral valence, compared with non-exposed individuals in SCR. No association between exposure to adversity and fear potentiated startle was observed. Furthermore, explorative analyses revealed moderate dimensional and categorical agreement between two childhood maltreatment questionnaires and provide insight into potential adversity-type specific effects. Our results support experience-dependent plasticity in sympathetic nervous system reactivity and suggest distinct response profiles in affective modulation in individuals exposed to early versus recent adversity. We emphasize the need to further explore distinct adversity profiles to further our understanding on specific psychophysiological profiles and their potential implication for prevention and intervention.

CO2 laser vaporisation and trichloroacetic acid (TAA) have been applied in treating several otological diseases, both with favourable therapeutic efficacy. However, long-term therapeutic efficacy of both CO2 laser vaporisation and TAA cauterisation against GM has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of CO2 laser vaporisation and TAA cauterisation in GM management.Study Design Prospective and randomised study.Participants A total of 88 GM patients who failed therapy with boric acid, alcohol and glycerin ear drop otic solution between July 2009 and January 2018 were included. Participants were randomly assigned to receive CO2 laser vaporisation (n = 39) or TAA cauterisation (n = 49).Main Outcome Measures Main outcomes were treatment success, complications after 4 months of treatment, and recurrence within 4-12 months after treatment.Results The success rate was significantly higher in the CO2 group than in the TAA group (94.9% vs. 77.6%, p = .023). After 4 months of treatment, the GM recurrence rate was comparable between the two groups (13.5% vs. 18.4%, p = .562). The CO2 laser group had one case of perforation and one case of severe vertigo, whereas one participant in the TAA cauterisation group experienced hearing loss.Conclusion Both TAA cauterisation and CO2 laser vaporisation are safe and effective treatments for GM. The success rate of CO2 laser vaporisation for treating GM is higher than that of TAA cauterisation. Recurrence rates are comparable within 1 year.

Here, we tried to explore the function of NT157, an IGF1R-IRS1/2 inhibitor, in ovarian cancer. We treated ovarian cancer cells with varying doses of NT157. The MTT assay was employed to evaluate cell proliferation and colony formation assay was used for detecting colony-forming ability. TUNEL assay was adopted to test cell apoptosis. Cell invasion was checked by the Transwell assay. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins, autophagy markers, IRS1/2, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was compared by Western blot, immunofluorescence, or qRT-PCR. As indicated by the data, NT157 abated the viability, proliferation, and induced autophagy of ovarian cancer cells. Overexpressing IRS1/2 attenuated the tumor-suppressive effect of NT157 and heightened the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway enhanced the tumor-suppressive effect of NT157 and facilitated NT157-mediated autophagy. However, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA partly reversed NT-157-mediated antitumor effects. In conclusion, this study disclosed that NT157 suppressed the malignant phenotypes of ovarian cancer cells by inducing autophagy and hampering the expression of IRS1/2 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

However, its diagnostic accuracy is hampered by its dependence on neuron length, with minimal consideration for other parameters, including the origin of these nerves, the corneal stromal-epithelial nerve penetration sites. This study sought to utilize high-resolution images of murine corneal nerves to analyze comprehensively the morphological changes associated with type 2 diabetes progression. Materials and Methods beta III-Tubulin immunostained corneas from prediabetic and type 2 diabetic mice and their respective controls were imaged by scanning confocal microscopy and analyzed automatically for nerve parameters. Additionally, the number and distribution of penetration sites was manually ascertained and the average length of the axons exiting them was computed. ResultsThe earliest detectable changes included a significant increase in nerve density (6.06 +/- 0.41% vs 8.98 +/- 1.99%, P = 0.03) and branching (2867.8 +/- 271.3/mm(2) vs 4912.1 +/- 1475.3/mm(2), P = 0.03), and in the number of penetration sites (258.80 +/- 20.87 vs 422.60 +/- 63.76, P = 0.0002) at 8 weeks of age. At 16 weeks, corneal innervation decreased, most notably in the periphery. The number of penetration sites remained significantly elevated relative to controls throughout the monitoring period. Similarly, prediabetic mice exhibited an increased number of penetration sites (242.2 +/- 13.55 vs 305.6 +/- 30.96, P = 0.003) without significant changes to the nerves. ConclusionsOur data suggest that diabetic peripheral neuropathy may be preceded by a phase of neuron growth rather than regression, and that the peripheral cornea is more sensitive than the center for detecting changes in innervation.

Many novel statistical methods that aim to efficiently capture potential long-term survival improvements have been proposed in recent years. However, the vast majority do not consider stratification, which is a major limitation considering that most large confirmatory studies currently employ a stratified primary analysis. In this article, we combine recently proposed weighted log-rank tests that have been designed to work well under a delayed separation of survival curves, with stratification by a baseline variable. The aim is to increase the efficiency of the test when the stratifying variable is highly prognostic for survival. As there are many potential ways to combine the two techniques, we compare several possibilities in an extensive simulation study. We also apply the techniques retrospectively to two recent randomized clinical trials.

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis. MethodsTwelve databases were reviewed for dissertations and peer-reviewed articles on filial obligation and caregiver depression among adult children, published before January 2020. In total, 476 titles and abstracts were retrieved. Final analysis included six studies; of these, four were included in the meta-analysis. ResultsFixed-effects model indicated that a stronger perception of filial obligation was associated with increased depressive symptoms among caregivers across cultures (beta = 0.14, 95% CI [0.04, 0.24], p < 0.01, N = 394). However, a non-significant effect size in the correlation between these two variables was found in samples predominated by Caucasian and mixed-blood caregivers (r = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.10], p > 0.05, N = 880). Therefore, caregivers' perceptions of filial obligation should be clinically assessed and normalised to reduce their depressive symptoms.

How to effectively extract video features and identify human behaviour is a current research hotspot. In this paper, the authors propose a convolutional neural network model based on the deformable convolution including a residual module and an attention module. The model fuses and encodes video spatial features on the time axis and extracts semantic information. The authors combine the attention mechanism to extract local and global features in the video, which are used to calculate spatial features and micro-motion features, respectively. Temporal attention mechanism fuses each micro-motion feature of video to extract higher-level semantic features of motion. Next, the authors describe their proposed model based on deep learning. First, the authors introduce a video frame sampling method based on the TRN algorithm. Second, they design a feature extraction and fusion model based on the ResNet model and the attention mechanism that extract local and global features in videos. Finally, the authors classify and identify the extracted video features through the classifier. The authors' approach shows comparable performance on publicly available datasets.

This work describes a novel PCR assay for the specific detection of Tenacibaculum piscium, a species recently described and identified in tenacibaculosis outbreaks in Norway and Chile. The designed primers amplified a 678-bp fragment of the peptidase gene (peptidase M23 family) from T. piscium. This method is specific for T. piscium; no other chromosomal DNA amplification products were obtained for other Tenacibaculum species. In pure cultures, the PCR assay detected up to 500 pg of DNA, or the equivalent of 2.44 +/- 0.06 x 10(4) CFU/ml. For seeded fish samples (i.e., gills, liver, kidney, and mucus), the sensitivity limit was 4.88 +/- 0.11 x 10(6) CFU/g, sufficient to detect T. piscium in acute infections in fish. Notably, this sensitivity level was 100-fold lower for DNA extracted from mucus samples. As compared to other existing methodologies (e.g., gene sequencing), the PCR approach described in this work allowed for the easiest detection of T. piscium in mucus samples obtained from challenged fish, an important outcome considering that the identification of this bacterium is difficult. Our results indicate that the designed specific primers and PCR method provide a rapid and specific diagnosis of T. piscium.

Valorization of Citrus limetta peel and pulp wastes by their co-liquefaction in a hydrogen-donor solvent such as methanol was chosen as an objective herein for efficient conversion of raw materials to obtain better quality biocrude.RESULTS: A maximum biocrude yield of 11.25 wt. % was obtained from solvothermal co-liquefaction of Citrus limetta peel and pulp biomasses at 260 degrees C temperature, with 30 min residence time, at three different ratios of biomass to solvent (1:2, 1:3 and 1:4). This was higher than the biocrude yield from liquefaction of individual C. limetta pulp biomass as well as other studies on similar citrus fruit wastes. The higher heating value (HHV) of biocrude was raised to 25.72 MJ kg-1 at 1:3 biomass:solvent ratio by co-liquefaction, showing its synergy over individual C. limetta peel biocrude. The presence of esters, ketones, alcohols, hydrocarbons and fatty acids in the biocrude product were found from Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) results. The biochar obtained was mesoporous in nature and could be employed for adsorption in bioremediation of water and soil.CONCLUSION: Co-liquefaction of homogeneous lignocellulosic biomasses have the ability to boost production and the quality of the biocrude and biochar attained in comparison to products of individual liquefaction. Future studies on upgrading the quality of products are required.

As the key part, a series of orthogonal pairs have been developed to site-specifically incorporate hundreds of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins by using bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, animals, or plants as hosts. Among them, the pair of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(Tyr) from Methanococcus jannaschii and the pair of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(Pyl) from Methanosarcina species are the most popular ones. Recently, other "not-so-popular" orthogonal pairs have started to attract attentions, because they can provide more choices of ncAA candidates and are necessary for simultaneous incorporation of multiple ncAAs into a single protein. Here, we summarize the development and applications of those "not-so-popular" orthogonal pairs, providing guidance for studying and engineering proteins.

Failure costs, insufficient maintenance costs, and replenishment costs are all deemed lower than capital costs, depending on the size of the lot for materials. Damage occurs at a degree that is independent of time. A backlog phase is allowed in the model. The backlog is being reduced at a steady pace. In this scenario, results that confirm the existence of an optimal policy and a testing algorithm are demonstrated. The survey system's overall cost is also demonstrated to be proportional to the number of refills. As a result, the ideal number of refills is determined using a solution method. The result is verified with the help of a numerical example.

The production strain was obtained from a Paenibacillus lentus recipient strain that has been evaluated previously by EFSA and considered to be safe. The genetic modification does not raise safety concerns and there were no antibiotic resistance genes from the genetic modification in the production strain. Viable cells and the DNA of the production strain were not found in the intermediate product used to formulate the additive. Hemicell((R)) HT/HT-L produced by Paenibacillus lentus DSM 33618 is considered safe for the above-mentioned target species at the intended conditions of use. The use of Hemicell((R)) HT/HT-L as a feed additive raises no concerns for the consumer or for the environment. Hemicell((R)) HT/HT-L is not irritant to the skin and eyes but is regarded as a dermal sensitiser and a potential respiratory sensitiser. The additive has a potential to be efficacious at 32,000 U/kg in chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying, minor poultry species for fattening or reared for laying/breeding, pigs for fattening and minor porcine species, and at 48,000 U/kg in turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding and weaned piglets.

However, mild steel's high susceptibility to corrosion under acidic conditions leads to vast economic losses and environmental consequences. Inhibitors used for steel corrosion in the acidic medium are ordinarily polar heteroaromatic molecules with electronegative atoms. Acridines are one type of inhibitor with several advantages, such as heteroatoms, functional groups and their polarity, double bond conjugation, and importantly efficient and non-hazardous synthetic routes. The polar moieties of such inhibitors are considered to augment their adsorption on steel surface, thus creating a shielding to inhibit steel corrosion. Acridine analogs are N-heterocyclic organic compounds that can be easily produced owing to impeccable inhibition capacity. The current review discusses the chemistry, synthesis, corrosion inhibition mechanism, and properties of acridines and their derivatives.

J	Bogliaccini, JA; Madariaga, A; Peralta, M				Bogliaccini, Juan A.; Madariaga, Aldo; Peralta, Miski			Skills formation and (un)employment in Latin America: Evidence from Chile	DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW			English	Article						Chile; labour market; Latin America; skills training	ECONOMY	Motivation: Skills formation and training have been singled out as key policies to adapt to contemporary labour-market challenges such as automation and skill-biased technological change particularly in middle-income countries such as those in Latin America. However, limited knowledge about the effects of training policies in Latin America hinders adaptation to these transformations. Purpose: This article contributes to the limited knowledge to date about the impact of skills formation in Latin America, with reference to Chile, a country usually considered a successful case of educational achievement and employment but sharing many of the development problems of its Latin American peers. By doing this, it provides empirical evidence to substantiate existing theories explaining these problems. Methods and approach: Using available longitudinal data from Chile (Encuesta de Proteccion Social, EPS), we analyse the causal effects of training on the transitions from unemployment to employment through a difference-in-difference (DiD) strategy. Findings: Results suggest that there is a small but significantly positive effect of training in reducing post-training unemployment, as yearly unemployment among individuals attending training while unemployed is reduced, on average, by two weeks. Policy implications: Results confirm the low and highly segmented incidence of training in the region, highlighting the need to discuss the design of training programmes to improve their effects, including the creation of differentiated programmes for unemployed and employed workers. For the former, it is important to strengthen labour intermediation to overcome problems of social capital; for the latter, it is key to achieve the stronger incorporation of employers in the discussion on training and industry standards. In both cases, it is crucial to create institutions promoting stronger co-ordination between the interested actors.

Using a combination of genome-wide CRISPR screening in mammalian cells and RNAi screening in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identify chaperonin containing TCP-1 subunit 4 (CCT4) as a critical regulator of protein secretion and vesicle trafficking. In C. elegans, deficiency of cct-4 as well as other CCT subunits impairs the trafficking of endocytic markers in intestinal cells, and this defect resembles that of dyn-1 RNAi worms. Consistent with these findings, the silencing of CCT4 in human cells leads to defective endosomal trafficking, and this defect can be rescued by the dynamin activator Ryngo 1-23. These results suggest that the cytosolic chaperonin CCT may regulate vesicle trafficking by promoting the folding of dynamin in addition to its known substrate tubulin. Our findings establish an essential role for the CCT chaperonin in regulating vesicle trafficking, and provide new insights into the regulation of vesicle trafficking and the cellular function of the cytosolic chaperonin.

We aimed to report the features, clinical course, management, and outcome of the Monkeypox cases diagnosed in the Dermatology and Infectious Disease Units of the San Martino Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We performed an observational study of the Monkeypox cases diagnosed from July 1 until August 31, 2022, collecting clinical, laboratory, and histological data. We studied 16 Monkeypox-infected men (14 homosexual, 2 bisexual) with a median age of 37 years. Three were HIV-infected. All patients reported multiple sexual partners and/or unprotected sex in the 2 weeks before the diagnosis. Most patients had prodromal signs/symptoms before the appearance of the skin/mucosal eruption, consisting of erythematous papules/vesicles/pustules in the anogenital area, which tended to erode evolving into crusts and ulcers. Lesions were often associated with local and/or systemic symptoms. Histopathology showed overlapping features in all cases: epidermal ulceration and dermal inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and neutrophils with an interstitial and perivascular/peri-adnexal pattern and endothelial swelling. Concomitant sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (gonococcal/nongonococcal proctitis and anal high-risk human papillomavirus [HR-HPV] infection) were frequent. Four patients were hospitalized, and one received specific treatment. The overall outcome was good. At the follow-up visit, three patients presented skin scars. Our series confirms the features of the current Monkeypox outbreak; however, different from other studies, we found a considerable rate of concomitant STIs, such as anal HR-HPV infection, that should be kept in mind because this persistent infection is the main cause of anal cancers.

Single-atom alloys (SAAs) with the characteristics of unique electronic structures, well-defined active sites, and maximum atom utilization demonstrate promising potential to replace traditional noble metal catalysts. SAAs are expected to tailor the adsorption properties of reaction species, thus promoting electrocatalytic behaviors. Herein, representative synthetic strategies including wet chemistry, galvanic replacement, dealloying, and atomic layer deposition are introduced, followed by a summary of applications of SAAs in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and ethanol electro-oxidation to provide an in-depth understanding of the structure-activity relationship. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives in this emerging field of SAAs are discussed.

Spatiotemporal risk factors predict landscape-scale survivorship for a northern ungulate	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Antilocapra americana; Bayesian; ecological trap; fences; habitat restoration; linear features; pronghorn; proportional hazards; roads; survival	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; HABITAT SELECTION; PREDATION RISK; PRONGHORN; MORTALITY; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; SURVIVAL; CARIBOU; OIL	Effective wildlife conservation requires decomposing the drivers of population dynamics for species affected by anthropogenic habitat alterations. Ungulates are often the focus of management actions to restore habitat and maintain connectivity as they are sensitive to landscape disturbances. We used Bayesian proportional hazards models to assess anthropogenic risk factors that could potentially predict landscape-scale survivorship for pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) in the Northern Sagebrush Steppe ecosystem, where extensive habitat alterations occurred from the conversion of native sagebrush grasslands to agricultural lands. Using 170 adult female pronghorn monitored from 2003 to 2011, we tested the importance of linear features (road and fence densities) and forage productivity (maximum decadal normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) for spatiotemporal pronghorn mortality risk, while accounting for a seasonally varying proxy of snow depth. We found moderate support for the effects of linear features on mortality risk as coefficient estimates translated to predicted declines in survivorship of 27.1% over the observed range of road densities (0-1.4 km/km(2)) and 11.8% over the range of fence densities (0-6.1 km/km(2)) encountered by pronghorn. Our results also suggested that agricultural areas could act as ecological traps for pronghorn, based on mortality risk increasing by a factor of 14.3% with every 0.1 increase in maximum decadal NDVI in summer (range = 0.38-0.73). Like our previous findings, we found considerable support for the effects of average depth (in centimeters) of snow water equivalent (SWE; SWE depth = snow depth x snow density/water density) within pronghorn seasonal ranges, with mortality risk increasing by 45.7% with every 1 cm increase in SWE depth (range = 0-5.37 cm). We then developed the first broadscale, spatially explicit map of predicted annual pronghorn survivorship based on anthropogenic features and environmental gradients to identify areas for conservation and habitat restoration efforts. These efforts to highlight anthropogenic risk factors on the landscape will hopefully support conservation and habitat restoration for pronghorn populations at the northern periphery of their range.

Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, patients with CLL appear to be a vulnerable population. In addition, phase III mRNA vaccine trials did not provide information about the efficacy in immunocomprised population. In CLL, the antibody-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is impaired. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on humoral immune response and on cellular immunity in CLL patients. Humoral immune response to BNT162b2 messenger RNA COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated in 44 CLL patients comprising 20 treatment-naive, 14 under treatment with ibrutinib and 10 in follow-up after completion of therapy. A positive serological response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with IgG titers higher than 13 UA/ml was detected in 54.6% of CLL patients with a higher response in patients who obtained remission after treatment. Reduced antibody response was detected in patients under ibrutinib treatment. T-cell response to overlapping pool of peptides representing the spike region was assessed in paired CLL samples collected before and after 1 month from the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in treatment-naive and ibrutinib-treated CLL patients using cytokine secretion assay. Both CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ T cells are able to mount a cellular response to spike peptides with secretion of IFN gamma and TNF alpha before and after vaccination in both treatment naive and ibrutinib-treated patients and this cellular immune response is independent by COVID-19 vaccination. Collectively, T cell response to spike peptides appeared more blunted in CLL patients under treatment with ibrutinib compared to untreated ones. Our study supports the need for optimization of vaccination strategy to achieve an adequate immune response keeping strict preventive measures by CLL patients against COVID-19.

Ecological impacts of the industrial revolution in a lowland raised peat bog near Manchester, NW England	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						human impact; industrial revolution; paleoecology; peat bogs; pollen; UK	SPHAGNUM-IMBRICATUM; MOLINIA-CAERULEA; TESTATE AMEBAS; HEAVY-METALS; BLANKET MIRE; SOUTH WALES; CARBON LOSS; POLLEN; CLIMATE; CONSERVATION	(1) Ombrotrophic peat bogs provide valuable records of environmental change on long timescales but are rarely preserved near the major centers of industrial activity. Holcroft Moss is a rare example of a stratigraphically intact lowland peat bog in NW England, which provides a valuable opportunity to trace industrial impacts on vegetation in a sensitive environmental archive close to the early industrializing cities of Manchester and Liverpool. (2) We reconstructed environmental changes at Holcroft Moss before and after the Industrial Revolution using a decadal-scale record of pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, microcharcoal, peat composition (organic content and ash-free bulk density) and heavy metal content, constrained by a radiocarbon and SCP (spheroidal carbonaceous particle) chronology. We examine the relationship between abiotic and biotic environmental tracers using principal component analysis and evaluate the role of local and regional climatic and anthropogenic drivers using canonical redundancy analysis and partitioning of variation. (3) Results show significant changes in bog vegetation composition during the last 700 years. Prior to 1750 CE, climate and agro-pastoral activity (grazing and fires) were the main drivers of vegetation change. Subsequently, regional coal-fired industry contributed to major increases in atmospheric pollutants (dust, heavy metals, and acid deposition) that severely impacted vegetation, driving the decline of Sphagnum. Grasses rose to dominance in the 20th century associated especially with bog conversion and cumulative nitrogen deposition. Although atmospheric pollution significantly decreased in the post-industrial era, vegetation has not returned to pre-industrial conditions, reflecting the ongoing impact of global change drivers which pose challenges for conservation and restoration. (4) Synthesis. Paleoecological studies are needed to reveal the long-term history of vegetation degradation and to offer guidelines for restoration and conservation practices. This study reconstructs the last 700 years of a peat bog located between Manchester and Liverpool, revealing the timing and nature of vegetation changes across the trajectory of early industrialization and eventual post-industrial decline. Our study reveals the progressive dominance of regional anthropogenic forcing and highlights that the present-day vegetation does not have past analogs within the last 700 years. Conservation measures favoring the reintroduction of Sphagnum are justified in redressing the major biological legacy of the Industrial Revolution, while steps to increase Calluna should also be considered in light of its resilience to dry and fire-prone conditions.

On the one hand, ADs can increase the incidence of tumours; on the other hand, malignant tumours can cause rheumatic disease-like manifestations. With the increasing depth of analysis into the mechanism of N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, it has been found that changes in m6A-related modification enzymes are closely related to the occurrence and development of ADs and malignant tumours. In this review, we explore the pathogenesis of ADs and tumours based on m6A modification. According to systematic assessment of the similarities between ADs and tumours, m6A may represent a common target of both diseases. At present, most of the drugs targeting m6A are in the research and development stage, not in clinical trials. Therefore, advancing the development of drugs targeting m6A is of great significance for both the combined treatment of ADs and malignant tumours and improving the quality of life and prognosis of patients.

However, industrial explosion in the past few decades have led to depletion of many natural resources. The dependency of life is majorly supported by fresh water, which is the most important natural resource. In today's world of fast depleting resources, there is a need to discover methods and awareness programmes to support conservation and sustenance of natural resources. This study emphasizes on awareness amongst rural population that accounts to 136.64 crores as per the census survey of 2019; rural population is 68.84% which is not a negligible number. Owing to the size of the rural population, it is imperative to create awareness about the environmental aspects and remedies so they can learn and further it as a legacy to coming generations. Social media plays a very vital role in everyday life and can be used as an important tool to spread awareness with great efficiency. This research aims to find out the level of awareness regarding "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" among rural people through social media. In this study, researcher will explore the dependency of social media, attain knowledge, and resolve issues. This study will emphasize on the water cleanliness issue highlighting prominent campaign of "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" through social medium tools (WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, MoJo, MaxTakatak, and YouTube) to get comprehensive results. In this study, four villages will be covered, and one hundred rural people will be the target audience. Finally, researcher concludes that social medium tools can create effective role in awareness of environmental issues that can encourage rural people to understand critical environment situations and strategically handle with care for the safe environment. As a result, better awareness programmes can be developed for the rural population through social media.

The rhino-orbito-cerebral localization is the most frequent. Other localizations have been reported including: cutaneous, pulmonary, disseminated, gastrointestinal, and miscellaneous. Mucormycosis of external ear with facial palsy is extremely rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. We describe a case of mucormycosis of the external and middle in a 44-years-old diabetic patient which had a very aggressive form of necrotic infection of the ear auricle complicated by parotid abscess, facial, and vagal nerve paralysis. Auricular mucormycosis was suspected and the diagnosis was established after biopsy and histological examination. The patient was treated immediately with intravenous amphotericin B followed by extensive surgical debridement of the necrotic lesions. The patient responded well to the treatment despite the persistence of facial palsy.

J	Hanley-Smith, N				Hanley-Smith, Natalie			The Political Mistress: Intimacy, Emotion, and Parliamentary Politics in the Late 18th Century	PARLIAMENTARY HISTORY			English	Article						Countess Bessborough; emotion; extra-parliamentary discussions; female political influence; Granville Leveson Gower; intimacy; maiden speech; mistresses; party politics; 18th-century parliament		Between c.1796 and 1809, Lady Harriet Ponsonby, Countess Bessborough and Lord Granville Leveson Gower were embroiled in a passionate affair. Their liaison created tensions in aristocratic society because they belonged to rival political parties, the Whigs and the Tories respectively. In the early years of their relationship, Leveson Gower was emerging on the political scene, while the countess was already well-versed in the complexities of party politics. Leveson Gower thus solicited her advice and support and Bessborough duly shared her knowledge and insight into the political world, which created an unusual dynamic that scholars have yet to explore. This article examines several letters that Bessborough wrote to Leveson Gower to analyse how she supported her lover's fledgling parliamentary career and how she navigated their political differences. I argue that Bessborough adapted a rhetoric of affection, deference, duty, and loyalty, that was typically used by aristocratic wives, to justify her interest in her lover's career and her passion for parliamentary politics. This article contributes to scholarship that explores aristocratic women's political participation by examining the strategies a political mistress could employ to exert influence over men. It also illustrates the value of using methodologies from the history of emotions to investigate the drives and passions that shaped interactions in the late 18th-century political sphere.											45	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0264-2824	1750-0206		PARLIAM HIST	Parliam.

Despite Sri Lanka having 40 lagoons, inventories on the lagoon ichthyofauna are rather meagre and data on fish diversity and assemblages are scarce. An assessment of fish diversity is essential to maintain the ecological stability and lagoon fisheries. This study examined the fish fauna of the Batticaloa lagoon considering the northern and southern regions of the lagoon and various depths through a 3-year survey (2017-2019) and documented the dominant and rare fish species. In addition, biodiversity measures, species assemblages and the role of environmental parameters on the distribution of fishes were documented. Various diversity indices (the Margalef richness index, the Shannon-Weiner diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, the dominance index, the taxonomic diversity index, the average taxonomic distinctness index and the total taxonomic distinctness index) were calculated. Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was used to examine the seasonal and regional differences in the fish assemblages. The survey showed the occurrence of 96 species belonging to 40 families and 11 orders. Ambassis gymnocephalus was the most abundant fish species (8.7% of the total number of fishes collected) followed by Etroplus suratensis (6.8%), Arius maculatus (6.1%), Gerres filamentosus (5.3%), Oreochromis niloticus (4.6%) and Gerres abbreviates (3.9%). Dasyatis uarnak (0.02%), Acanthurus gahhm (0.03%), Alectis ciliaris (0.04%) and Crossorhombus valderostratus (0.08%) were considered as rare species which constitute less than 0.1% of the total while D. uarnak was considered a doubletons species (represented twice in the whole sample of 16 stations). Two types of species assemblages, one in the northern region and one in the southern region, were evident in a dendrogram (Based on the samples were collected on each region dendrogram were plotted with respect to sites then finally dendrogram of one region pratly connected by other region) based on sample composition similarity estimated with a Bray-Curtis matrix and nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was 59.03% between the two regions, indicating statistically significant differences in assemblages (ANOSIM R 0.801; P < 0.01). The northern region of the lagoon had a higher number of species, density, Margalef richness, Pielou's evenness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, taxonomic diversity, taxonomic distinctness and total taxonomic distinctness compared to the southern region. The northern region showed significantly higher levels of salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) and the southern region higher temperature, turbidity, phosphates and nitrates. The best subset of biota and environmental variables [BEST (BIO-ENV)] test showed a significant relationship between fish assemblage and environmental parameters. Distance-based linear model analysis showed a significant relationship between fish assemblage and the environmental parameters salinity, temperature, pH and DO. The sequential test of this analysis showed the environmental parameters to explain about 74.9% (R-2) of the total variation. The bioenvironmental model developed was found to be appropriate. Thirteen species were found to be influential as they explained the overall fish distribution pattern with a Spearman rank correlation of 0.951. Ten groups of coherent species were also identified in the study area. In stations having anthropogenic activities, the fish diversity was low. The fish fauna of the Batticaloa lagoon should be monitored periodically to protect the fishery resources here. An understanding of the role that environment plays in structuring the fish assemblage in the Batticaloa lagoon and locations with critical habitats will be of great importance in the conservation and management of fishery resources in this lagoon. However, as monitoring only the dominant species may fail to pick up on important impacts affecting the less common species, it should be done using diversity indices and rare fish species. Monitoring is imperative in view of the livelihood of the fishers this lagoon supports and the health of the local people, as fish is a healthy food. The fishery resources of this lagoon must be protected for posterity with appropriate management measures.

This study compared the long-term outcome of patients with recurrent and multifocal HCC meeting the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A with repeat hepatectomy (RH) and RH combined with intraoperative radiofrequency ablation (RFA).Methods: A total of 109 consecutive patients with intrahepatic early-stage multifocal rHCC within BCLC stage A following RH or RH + RFA were retrospectively collected from April 2010 to May 2020. Propensity score matching, subgroup analysis, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Overall survival after recurrence (rOS) and recurrence-free survival after recurrence (rRFS) were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year rOS and rRFS of the combination group and the RH group were similar (p = .699; p = .587, respectively). The similar results also appeared in matched population. Subgroup analyses indicated that there was no significant difference between patients with two tumors and three tumors, but the RH group was associated with better rRFS than the combination group for patients whose tumors were located in the same lobe (p = .045). Multivariate analysis revealed that time to recurrence (TTR)<= 2 years and intrahepatic metastasis (IM) pathologically were independent risk factors.Conclusions: For multifocal rHCC patients meeting the BCLC stage A, tumor which is difficult to be surgically resected could be treated by RFA in order to avoid complications or bleeding. Tumors which were located in the same lobe may be more suitable to be treated by RH alone.

Genotype accounts for intraspecific variation in the timing and duration of multiple, sequential life-cycle events in a willow species	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						coastal willow; heritability; genetic variation; National Phenology Network; phenology; plasticity; Salicaceae; Salix hookeriana	TEMPERATE WOODY-PLANTS; 1ST FLOWERING DATES; FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; GENETIC-VARIATION; LEAF PHENOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; FROST DAMAGE; RESPONSES; TREE	PremisePhenological variation among individuals within populations is common and has a variety of ecological and evolutionary consequences, including forming the basis for population-level responses to environmental change. Although the timing of life-cycle events has genetic underpinnings, whether intraspecific variation in the duration of life-cycle events reflects genetic differences among individuals is poorly understood. MethodsWe used a common garden experiment with 10 genotypes of Salix hookeriana (coastal willow) from northern California, United States to investigate the extent to which genetic variation explains intraspecific variation in the timing and duration of multiple, sequential life-cycle events: flowering, leaf budbreak, leaf expansion, fruiting, and fall leaf coloration. We used seven clones of each genotype, for a total of 70 individual trees. ResultsGenotype affected each sequential life-cycle event independently and explained on average 62% of the variation in the timing and duration of vegetative and reproductive life-cycle events. All events were significantly heritable. A single genotype tended to be "early" or "late" across life-cycle events, but for event durations, there was no consistent response within genotypes. ConclusionsThis research demonstrates that genetic variation can be a major component underlying intraspecific variation in the timing and duration of life-cycle events. It is often assumed that the environment affects durations, but we show that genetic factors also play a role. Because the timing and duration of events are independent of one another, our results suggest that the effects of environmental change on one event will not necessarily cascade to subsequent events.
