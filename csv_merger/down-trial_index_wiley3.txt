J	del Campo, MDD; Romero, A; Salega, S; Guichon, RA				D'Angelo del Campo, Manuel Domingo; Romero, Alejandro; Salega, Soledad; Guichon, Ricardo Anibal			Ecogeography-related humerus morphological variation within southern Patagonia hunter-gatherers	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article						environment; humerus; size-related changes; subsistence strategy	TIERRA-DEL-FUEGO; HUMAN-BODY SIZE; POSTCRANIAL ROBUSTICITY; BILATERAL ASYMMETRY; EXTINCT ABORIGINES; DIFFERENTIATION; VARIABILITY; SELECTION; FORAGERS; LINEAGES	ObjectivesSouthern Patagonian (SP) hunter-gatherers were adapted to diverse environments and subsistence strategies. However, ecological factors affecting variation in upper-limb proportions have not been thoroughly examined. This study analyses whether size-related humerus morphology differs among hunter-gatherers from SP according to specific subsistence economy and physical environment. Materials and MethodsThirty-nine left humeri of adult individuals were selected from well-documented SP archeological sites. Individuals were grouped into terrestrial or maritime hunter-gatherers based on diet-related archeological and stable isotope records. Five humeral head and diaphyseal metrics were taken and statistically compared among subsistence strategy groups across four ecogeographic subregions. ResultsTerrestrial hunter-gatherers exhibit greater humeral dimensions compared to maritime hunter-gatherers. An ecogeographic pattern of humerus size variation was also found, showing significant size reduction in individuals from southern regions. ConclusionThe previously determined low genetic variability within hunter-gatherers from SP suggests that the physical environment played an important role in humeral adaptive plasticity. These findings also highlight morphological upper-limb responses to bioclimate factors derived from SP subregions.

Our previous research identified the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs3922G in the 3 ' UTR of CXCR5 as being associated with nonresponsiveness to the hepatitis B vaccine. The differential expression of CXCR5 between the dark zone (DZ) and light zone (LZ) is critical for organizing the functional structure of the germinal center (GC). In this study, we report that the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP3 can bind to CXCR5 mRNA containing the rs3922 variant to promote its degradation via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Deficiency of IGF2BP3 leads to increased CXCR5 expression, which results in the disappearance of CXCR5 differential expression between DZ and LZ, disorganized GCs, aberrant somatic hypermutations, and reduced production of high-affinity antibodies. Furthermore, the affinity of IGF2BP3 for the rs3922G-containing sequence is lower than that for the rs3922A counterpart, which may explain the nonresponsiveness to the hepatitis B vaccination. Together, our findings suggest that IGF2BP3 plays a crucial role in the production of high-affinity antibodies in the GC by binding to the rs3922-containing sequence to regulate CXCR5 expression.

Deficits in volumetric bone mineral density, bone microarchitecture, and estimated bone strength in women with atypical anorexia nervosa compared to healthy controls	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS			English	Article; Early Access						atypical anorexia nervosa; bone microarchitecture; eating disorder; volumetric bone mineral density	FRACTURE RISK; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; EATING-DISORDERS; BODY-COMPOSITION; ADOLESCENTS; PRECISION; MICROSTRUCTURE; PREVALENCE; RECOVERY; SPECTRUM	ObjectiveAnorexia nervosa is associated with low bone mineral density (BMD) and deficits in bone microarchitecture and strength. Low BMD is common in atypical anorexia nervosa, in which criteria for anorexia nervosa are met except for low weight. We investigated whether women with atypical anorexia nervosa have deficits in bone microarchitecture and estimated strength at the peripheral skeleton. MethodMeasures of BMD and microarchitecture were obtained in 28 women with atypical anorexia nervosa and 27 controls, aged 21-46 years. ResultsMean tibial volumetric BMD, cortical thickness, and failure load were lower, and radial trabecular number and separation impaired, in atypical anorexia nervosa versus controls (p < .05). Adjusting for weight, deficits in tibial cortical bone variables persisted (p < .05). Women with atypical anorexia nervosa and amenorrhea had lower volumetric BMD and deficits in microarchitecture and failure load versus those with eumenorrhea and controls. Those with a history of overweight/obesity or fracture had deficits in bone microarchitecture versus controls. Tibial deficits were particularly marked. Less lean mass and longer disease duration were associated with deficits in high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) variables in atypical anorexia nervosa. DiscussionWomen with atypical anorexia nervosa have lower volumetric BMD and deficits in bone microarchitecture and strength at the peripheral skeleton versus controls, independent of weight, and particularly at the tibia. Women with atypical anorexia nervosa and amenorrhea, less lean mass, longer disease duration, history of overweight/obesity, or fracture history may be at higher risk. This is salient as deficits in HR-pQCT variables are associated with increased fracture risk. Public SignificanceAtypical anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder in which psychological criteria for anorexia nervosa are met despite weight being in the normal range. We demonstrate that despite weight in the normal range, women with atypical anorexia nervosa have impaired bone density, structure, and strength compared to healthy controls. Whether this translates to an increased risk of incident fracture in this population requires further investigation.	[Haines, Melanie S.

Herein, a hierarchical hollow microsphere is assembled from heterostructured NiS/NiS2 nanoparticles confined by in situ carbon layer (H-NiS/NiS2@C) via regulating the sulfidation temperature of the precursor Ni-MOFs. The morphology of ultrathin hollow spherical shells and confinement of in situ carbon layer to active materials provide rich channels for ion/electron transfer and alleviate the effects of volume change and agglomeration of the material. Consequently, the as-prepared H-NiS/NiS2@C exhibit superb electrochemical properties, satisfactory initial specific capacity of 953.0 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), excellent rate capability of 509.9 mA h g(-1) at 2 A g(-1), and superior longtime cycling life with 433.4 mA h g(-1) after 4500 cycles at 10 A g(-1). Density functional theory calculation shows that heterogenous interfaces with electron redistribution lead to charge transfer from NiS to NiS2, and thus favor interfacial electron transport and reduce ion-diffusion barrier. This work provides an innovative idea for the synthesis of homologous heterostructures for high-efficiency SIB electrode materials.

Additional evidence suggests that microglia undergo dramatic morphological and phenotypic state changes during AD progression, as observed in human post-mortem tissue and animal model research. Although valuable, these studies are often hampered by either representing one time point in human tissue (end point) or because of the lack of conservation between species of microglial transcriptomes, proteomes and cell states. Thus, the development and application of novel human model systems have been beneficial in the study of microglia in neurodegeneration. Recent innovations include the use of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived microglia in 2D or 3D culture systems, the transdifferentiation of microglia from patient monocytes and the xenotransplantation of hPSC-derived microglia into mouse brains. This review summarizes the recent innovations that have advanced our understanding of microglia in AD, through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing, hPSC-derived microglia culture within brain organoids and xenotransplantation into mouse brain. Through outlining the strengths and limitations of these approaches, we provide recommendations that will aid future endeavours in advancing our understanding of the complex role of microglia in AD onset and progression.

Each EMC is composed of Emc1-7, Emc10, and either Emc8 or Emc9. Recent human genetics studies have implicated variants in EMC genes as the basis for a group of human congenital diseases. The patient phenotypes are varied but appear to affect a subset of tissues more prominently than others. Namely, craniofacial development seems to be commonly affected. We previously developed an array of assays in Xenopus tropicalis to assess the effects of emc1 depletion on the neural crest, craniofacial cartilage, and neuromuscular function. We sought to extend this approach to additional EMC components identified in patients with congenital malformations. Through this approach, we determine that EMC9 and EMC10 are important for neural crest development and the development of craniofacial structures. The phenotypes observed in patients and our Xenopus model phenotypes similar to EMC1 loss of function likely due to a similar mechanism of dysfunction in transmembrane protein topogenesis.

The objective of this case study was to implement these three deprescribing search filters in systematic review (SR) search strategies and to assess their effect on performances. SR that independently developed original search strategies (OSS) were selected. The deprescribing filters were implemented in each OSS, generating two implemented search strategies (ISS1 and ISS2) in MEDLINE and one ISS (ISS3) in Embase. OSS were re-run on the same date as ISS. The performances of ISS and OSS were calculated and compared. Two SR were included (SR1 and SR2). For MEDLINE, SR1 included 12 articles. The sensitivity was 50% for OSS, 58% for ISS1 and 42% for ISS2. SR2 included four articles. The sensitivity of OSS, ISS 1 and 2 was 25%. For Embase, SR1 included 12 articles. The sensitivity was 33% for OSS and 58% for ISS3. SR2 included four articles. None of the four included articles were retrieved with OSS or ISS3. While sensitivity of OSS was moderate, the objectively developed deprescribing filters maintained or slightly improved this sensitivity when implementing.

In the present study, MDA5 and LGP2 genes were identified in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), a fish species with a great economic value. The two proteins contained similar conserved domains and motifs as their counterparts of other vertebrates, including the DExDc domain (the DEAD/DEAH box helicases domain), HELICc domain (helicases superfamily domain), and regulatory domain (RD). Real-time qPCR revealed that the two genes were constitutively expressed in tissues of healthy fish and could be induced in the spleen by polyinosinic and polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) challenge in vivo. Also, selective pressure analysis revealed that the negative selection had roles in the evolutions of the two genes. Furthermore, the dsRNA binding mechanism of msLGP2 and msMDA5 were analyzed by the molecular docking strategy. The amino acids of msLGP2 involved in dsRNA binding were V604, N663, L682, and L684, which were located in the regulatory domain (RD) of msLGP2. The amino acids of msMDA5 involved in dsRNA binding were G429, H434, L842, and L845, which were located in the DExDc domain and the RD domain of msMDA5. These results indicated that fish LGP2 and MDA5 might share similar functions and ligand binding mechanism as their mammalian counterparts.

However, it is unclear whether PD patients at different dis-ease stages exhibit abnormal timescales accompanied with abnormal gray matter volume (GMV).Purpose: To assess the intrinsic timescale and GMV in PD.Study Type: Prospective. Population: 74 idiopathic PD patients (44 early stage (PD-ES) and 30 late stage (PD-LS), as determined by the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) severity classification scale), and 73 healthy controls (HC).Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0 T MRI scanner; magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo and echo planar imaging sequences.Assessment: The timescales were estimated by using the autocorrelation magnitude of neural signals. Voxel-based mor-phometry was performed to calculate GMV in the whole brain. Severity of motor symptoms and cognitive impairments were assessed using the unified PD rating scale, the HY scale, the Montreal cognitive assessment, and the mini-mental state examination.Statistical Test: Analysis of variance; two-sample t-test; Spearman rank correlation analysis; Mann-Whitney U test; Kruskal-Wallis' H test. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: The PD group had significantly abnormal intrinsic timescales in the sensorimotor, visual, and cognitive-related areas, which correlated with the symptom severity (? =-0.265, P = 0.022) and GMV (? = 0.254, P = 0.029). Compared to the HC group, the PD-ES group had significantly longer timescales in anterior cortical regions, whereas the PD-LS group had significantly shorter timescales in posterior cortical regions.Conclusion: This study suggested that PD patients have abnormal timescales in multisystem and distinct patterns of timescales and GMV in cerebral cortex at different disease stages. This may provide new insights for the neural sub-strate of PD.

The diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence-enabled liquid-based cytology (AI-LBC) triage approach remains unclear. Here, we compared the clinical performance of AI-LBC, human cytologists and HPV16/18 genotyping at triaging HPV-positive women. Material and methodsHPV-positive women were triaged using AI-LBC, human cytologists and HPV16/18 genotyping. Histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 or higher (CIN2+/CIN3+) were accepted as thresholds for clinical performance assessments. ResultsOf the 3514 women included, 13.9% (n = 489) were HPV-positive. The sensitivity of AI-LBC was comparable to that of cytologists (86.49% vs 83.78%, P = 0.744) but substantially higher than HPV16/18 typing at detecting CIN2+ (86.49% vs 54.05%, P = 0.002). While the specificity of AI-LBC was significantly lower than HPV16/18 typing (51.33% vs 87.17%, P < 0.001), it was significantly higher than cytologists at detecting CIN2+ (51.33% vs 40.93%, P < 0.001). AI-LBC reduced referrals to colposcopy by approximately 10%, compared with cytologists (51.53% vs 60.94%, P = 0.003). Similar patterns were also observed for CIN3+. ConclusionsAI-LBC has equivalent sensitivity and higher specificity compared with cytologists, with more efficient colposcopy referrals for HPV-positive women. AI-LBC could be particularly useful in regions where experienced cytologists are few in number. Further investigations are needed to determine triaging performance through prospective designs.

The comet assay is a sensitive method for the evaluation of DNA damages and DNA repair capacity at single-cell level. Allium cepa is a well-established plant model for toxicological studies. The aim of this scoping review was to investigate the recent application of the comet assay in Allium cepa root cells to assess the genotoxicity. To explore the literature a search was performed selecting articles published between January 2015 and February 2023 from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases using the combined search terms "Comet assay" and "Allium cepa". All the original articles that applied the comet assay to Allium cepa root cells were included. Of the 334 records initially found, 79 articles were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Some studies reported results for two or more toxicants. In these cases, the data for each toxicant were treated separately. Thus, the number of analyzed toxicants (such as chemicals, new materials, and environmental matrices) was higher than the number of selected papers and reached 90. The current use of the Allium-comet assay seems to be directed towards two types of approach: the direct study of the genotoxicity of compounds, mainly biocides (20% of analyzed compounds) and nano- and microparticles (17%), and assessing a treatment's ability to reduce or eliminate genotoxicity of known genotoxicants (19%). Although the genotoxicity identified by the Allium-comet assay is only one piece of a larger puzzle, this method could be considered a useful tool for screening the genotoxic potential of compounds released into the environment.

The COVID-19 pandemic-with prolonged, often enforced, reductions in people's social contact-reduced such exposure and may thus have exacerbated social anxiety symptoms. In this three-wave longitudinal study (N = 212) we explored whether people's membership in multiple groups could protect against anticipatory anxiety for, and avoidance of, social situations. In line with our predictions, pre-pandemic multiple group memberships reduced anticipatory anxiety and avoidance at Waves 1 and 2 (June and August 2020). Controlling for participants' pre-pandemic multiple group memberships, maintained group memberships (from pre-pandemic to Wave 2) predicted lower Wave 2 anticipatory anxiety and avoidance, and lower Wave 2 anticipatory anxiety predicted reduced social anxiety symptoms at Wave 3. These findings are discussed with an emphasis on how social identity theorising and cognitive behavioural approaches to social anxiety can be successfully integrated.

Herein, the 1-year performances of both monofacial and bifacial photovoltaic modules were monitored, compared, and analyzed at a solar carport system in the Korean peninsula. The environmental parameters during the four seasons were investigated for both systems under ambient conditions. Irradiance was determined as the primary influencing parameter in the system. The energy yield of the bifacial module system was 3.08% higher than that of the monofacial system owing to rear-side absorption during the study period. The loss mechanism for this lower yield was determined by investigating the irradiance effect. It was attributed to low bifaciality due to cell properties (optical and electrical properties, and the sorting effect) and module properties (shading effects from the junction box cable and frame design, and glass grid effect), design of the carport system, and the albedo effect. These analyses revealed that the photovoltaic energy yield can be increased further by reducing these loss parameters at the carport system. This study can contribute to achieving higher energy yield from photovoltaic systems during field applications.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 102 patients with stroke admitted to an acute hospital in Japan. Swabs were collected, and bacterial species found in swabs were isolated and identified using a selective agar medium and simple identification kits. In addition to demographic information, severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis and the total bacterial counts were measured. Results: Incontinence-associated dermatitis was present in 53.9% of the participants. Staphylococcus aureus was found in 50% of the participants with incontinence-associated dermatitis and only 17.9% of those without incontinence-associated dermatitis (P = 0.0029). Bacterial species distribution by erythema and skin erosion, which denote severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis, was different, but not significant; additionally, the total number of bacterial colonies was equivalent. Conclusions: Bacterial species distribution differed between patients with and without incontinence-associated dermatitis, whereas the total number of bacterial colonies was equivalent. A high detection rate of S. aureus on genital skin sites potentially affects the presence of incontinence-associated dermatitis and its severity.

Although past research has largely focused on how men's retirement might negatively shape their wife's health outcomes, it is possible that wives' retirement has detrimental effects on their husband's health as well.MethodUsing data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to identify the causal effects of spousal retirement on indicators of physical and mental health in married older adults.ResultsOur results suggested that men, not women, experience the most negative spousal spillover effects of retirement on their health outcomes. We found the most support for spillover effects on spouses' physical health outcomes. Additionally, men who are not working when their spouse retires experienced the most negative health effects.ConclusionWomen and men's health is differentially affected by spousal retirement, where men might be the most negatively affected by their spouses' transition in the US context. These results contradict conventional wisdom that undergirds numerous untested assumptions underlying prior research on this significant life transition.

The region is still covered by a large proportion of well-preserved tropical dry forest, characterized by a short period of rain and a dry season of around 8 months. We found a sustained temperature increase which is likely driven by global climate change. An increasing trend in rainfall was also found, but the trend was detected only during the wet season. Correspondingly, an increase in runoff during the rainfall season was also detected; this seems to be linked with an increasing number of intense rainfall events, rather than an increase in the total number of rainy days. El Nino years are likely to present below average precipitation during the wet season and above average precipitation during the dry season. The opposite is expected during La Nina years, when tropical cyclones are likely to come closer to the coast and cause intense rainfall events during the hurricane season. As many of the studied variables are likely to change under climate change scenarios, our results highlight the need to understand the expected impacts of global climate change on tropical dry forests. In particular, it is necessary to monitor changes in water availability to anticipate its consequences for the forest and the human communities that depend on it.

The different force acting on the stent-graft after EVAR caused by different abdominal artery anatomy of male and female AAA patients may be the reason for the sex-different complications. This article aims to explore the possible biomechanical mechanisms of sex differences by making a comparison of displacement force acting on the stent graft of male and female AAA patients. To explore the effect of different vascular anatomy on stent-graft migration, the uniformed models were constructed according to the specific vascular anatomy parameters of AAA patients of different sex, which have been measured before. The computational fluid dynamics method was used to quantitate the pulsatile force acting on the stent-graft after EVAR in a cardiac cycle. Then the displacement force was calculated with the pressure and the wall shear stress, and the total and area-weighted average of displacement force acting on the stent-graft were compared respectively. In one cardiac cycle, the wall pressure for the male model is greater than that of the female model (2.7-4.4 vs. 2.2-3.4 N), and the wall shear force for the female model is slightly greater (0-0.0065 vs. 0-0.0055 N). The displacement force is mainly provided by the wall pressure, which is also greater in the male model. However, the area-averaged displacement force is greater for the female model than that for the male model (180-290 vs. 160-250 Pa). Because of the different vascular anatomies, the impact caused by the pulsating aortic blood flow on the AAA stent-graft of women after EVAR was greater than that of men. Women's vascular anatomy leads to greater area-averaged displacement force after stent-graft implantation, resulting in a greater risk of stent-graft migration, which might be one of the reasons why women had a higher incidence of complications after EVAR.

The simulation program successfully reproduced the change of dispersities (Ds) during the polymerization process. Furthermore, the simulation suggested that the observed Ds (=1.5-2) are due to the distribution of the number of branches instead of undesired side reactions, and that the branch structures are well controlled. In addition, the analysis of the polymer structure reveals that the majority of HBPs have structures close to the ideal one. The simulation also suggested the slight dependence of branch density on molecular weight, which was experimentally confirmed by synthesizing HBPs with an evolmer having phenyl group.

The traditional autologous nerve graft approach remains the gold standard for the treatment of nerve injuries. While sources of autologous nerve grafts are very limited and difficult to obtain. Nerve guidance conduits are widely used in the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries as an alternative to nerve autografts and allografts. However, the development of nerve conduits does not meet the needs of large gap peripheral nerve injury. Functional nerve conduits can provide a good microenvironment for axon elongation and myelin regeneration. Herein, the manufacturing methods and different design types of functional bridging nerve conduits for nerve conduits combined with electrical or magnetic stimulation and loaded with Schwann cells, etc., are summarized. It summarizes the literature and finds that the technical solutions of functional nerve conduits with electrical stimulation, magnetic stimulation and nerve conduits combined with Schwann cells can be used as effective strategies for bridging large gap nerve injury and provide an effective way for the study of large gap nerve injury repair. In addition, functional nerve conduits provide a new way to construct delivery systems for drugs and growth factors in vivo.

Although the utilization of aqueous electrolytes and Zn metal anode in AZMBs ensures their improved safety over other metal batteries meanwhile guaranteeing their decent energy density at the cell level, plenty of challenges involved with metallic Zn anode still await to be addressed, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction, and zinc corrosion and passivation. In the past years, several attempts have been adopted to address these problems, among which engineering the aqueous electrolytes and additives is regarded as a facile and promising approach. In this review, a comprehensive summary of aqueous electrolytes and electrolyte additives will be given based on the recent literature, aiming at providing a fundamental understanding of the challenges associated with the metallic Zn anode in aqueous electrolytes, meanwhile offering a guideline for the electrolytes and additives engineering strategies toward stable AZMBs in the future.

However, the line connecting the centers of circles was not consistent with the surgical epicondylar axis (SEA) which was commonly used in surgery. Recently, ellipses have been proposed as an alternative method to represent the sagittal femoral condylar shape. Does the condylar ellipse line (CEL) coincide with the SEA in 3D MRI reconstruction analysis? Methods: From May to August 2021, a total of 80 healthy subjects were scanned by MRI on the right knee in this retrospective study. The ellipses on the most distal slices of the medial and lateral condyles were determined. A line connecting the centers of the medial and lateral ellipses was the CEL. A line connecting the deepest point of the medial sulcus and the most prominent point of the lateral epicondyle was the SEA. Angular measurement of the SEA and the CEL relative to the posterior condylar line (PCL) and the distal condylar line (DCL) was performed on an axial and coronal view of the 3D model, respectively. Measurements were compared between males and females by using the independent-samples t-test. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between SEA-PCL and CEL-PCL, SEA-DCL, and CEL-DCL. Results: On the axial view, the mean SEA-CEL was 0.35 degrees +/- 0.96 degrees. SEA-PCL (2.91 degrees +/- 1.40 degrees) had a high correlation with CEL-PCL (3.27 degrees +/- 1.11 degrees) (r = 0.731, p < 0.001). On the coronal view, the mean coronal SEA-CEL was 1.35 degrees +/- 1.13 degrees. SEA-DCL (1.35 degrees +/- 1.13 degrees) had a low correlation with CEL-DCL (0.18 degrees +/- 0.84 degrees) (r = 0.319, p = 0.007). On the sagittal view, the outlet points of the CEL on the medial and lateral epicondyles were anatomically located in the anteroinferior direction to the SEA. Conclusions: CEL traversed the medial and lateral epicondyles, which has a mean deviation of 0.35 degrees with SEA on axial view and a mean deviation of 0.18 degrees with DCL on coronal view. This study suggested that the ellipse approach is an improved scheme for representing the femoral condylar shape.

Healthy adult (18-39 years), habitual spherical silicone hydrogel contact lens wearers were included. The High-definition (HD) Analyzer (TM) was used to objectively measure the lens-on-eye optical system resulting from the study lenses at 1-week follow-up. Measurements assessed were vision break-up time (VBUT), modulation transfer function (MTF) cutoff, Strehl ratio (SR), potential visual acuity (PVA) for 100% contrast and objective scatter index (OSI).Results: Of the 50 enrolled participants, 47 (94.0%) were randomly assigned to one of the two possible lens wear sequences (test/control or control/test) and dispensed at least one study lens. The estimated odds ratio of VBUT > 10 s was 1.582 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.009 to 2.482) in test versus control lens. The least squares mean difference estimates of MTF cutoff, SR and PVA for 100% contrast between test versus control lens were 2.243 (95% CI: 0.012 to 4.475), 0.011 (95% CI: -0.002 to 0.023) and 0.073 (95% CI: -0.001 to 0.147), respectively. The estimated ratio of median OSI between test versus control lens was 0.887 (95% CI: 0.727 to 1.081). The test lens demonstrated superiority over the control lens with respect to VBUT and MTF cutoff. No serious adverse events were reported; eight adverse events (three ocular, five non-ocular) were indicated by six participants during the study.Conclusion: The test lens demonstrated an increased probability of having a longer VBUT (>10 s). Future studies may be designed to assess the efficacy and long-term use of the test lens in a larger population.

The participation of private entities could provide significant sustainability-related issues since they typically have a profit-making mindset. Private entities mainly focus on maximising their profits, but public entities are more concerned about attaining social objectives. The differences in their approaches lead to sustainability issues in a PPP airport project. However, studies on the impact of PPP on sustainability are very scarce and limited to other infrastructure sectors like health, education, and so forth. To examine the impact of PPP on Mumbai and Delhi International Airport's sustainability, this study used partial least squares structural equation modelling. The direct impact of private ownership, investment distribution, risk sharing, regulatory intervention, stakeholder engagement, and reputation and credibility on environmental, economic, and social sustainability was examined. The study revealed that PPP improved Mumbai and Delhi's airports' economic sustainability but have a smaller impact on social and environmental sustainability. Existing airports lag in social and environmental sustainability. To achieve social, environmental, and economic sustainability, the government must directly formulate and implement programmes. Regulators regulate JV activities and encourage social and environmental sustainability. Policymakers are likely to benefit most from building a favourable legal framework, commercial viability, and solid economic policies for effective private participation in PPP airports. The study focuses on institutional aspects. It will also help understand the mechanism's impact and how constructions and indicators are managed in PPP airport development.

Behavioral interactions between bark anoles and brown anoles in their nonnative range	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article						aggression; behavior; community structuring; florida; invasive species	INTERSPECIFIC AGGRESSION; HABITAT USE; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; BIOTIC HOMOGENIZATION; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; LIZARDS; SAGREI; CAROLINENSIS; ENCOUNTERS	Both intra- and interspecific interactions play crucial roles in defining the structure of ecological communities. However, the specific behavioral processes underlying this structuring are often unclear and must be inferred from contemporary interactions. Rapid spread of nonnative species has resulted in increasingly homogenized communities, and this homogenization provides an excellent opportunity to study the behavioral processes that lead to stable communities of introduced species in novel habitats. Here, we compared the behavior of brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) and bark anoles (A. distichus) when faced with an incursion by an unknown brown anole to examine the intra- and interspecific interactions underlying the structuring of novel communities in South Florida, USA. We found that brown anoles were consistently more aggressive toward intruders than bark anoles, and this pattern was accentuated when they encountered intruders of the same sex. Conversely, bark anoles were likely to flee when they encountered intruder brown anoles. We also found that brown anoles were likely to attack intruders regardless of whether they engaged in aggressive behavioral displays while bark anoles were likely to flee regardless of whether the intruder engaged in behavioral displays. Our findings suggest that behavioral interactions could play a significant role in structuring the novel Anolis communities in South Florida and demonstrate the importance of aggressive interactions both within and between species.

J	de Uña-Alvarez, J				de Una-Alvarez, Jacobo			Testing for an ignorable sampling bias under random double truncation	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						bootstrap; goodness-of-fit; interval sampling; nonparametric statistics; survival analysis	BIVARIATE SURVIVAL-DATA; INFERENCE; MODEL	In clinical and epidemiological research doubly truncated data often appear. This is the case, for instance, when the data registry is formed by interval sampling. Double truncation generally induces a sampling bias on the target variable, so proper corrections of ordinary estimation and inference procedures must be used. Unfortunately, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of a doubly truncated distribution has several drawbacks, like potential nonexistence and nonuniqueness issues, or large estimation variance. Interestingly, no correction for double truncation is needed when the sampling bias is ignorable, which may occur with interval sampling and other sampling designs. In such a case the ordinary empirical distribution function is a consistent and fully efficient estimator that generally brings remarkable variance improvements compared to the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator. Thus, identification of such situations is critical for the simple and efficient estimation of the target distribution. In this article, we introduce for the first time formal testing procedures for the null hypothesis of ignorable sampling bias with doubly truncated data. The asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistic are investigated. A bootstrap algorithm to approximate the null distribution of the test in practice is introduced. The finite sample performance of the method is studied in simulated scenarios. Finally, applications to data on onset for childhood cancer and Parkinson's disease are given. Variance improvements in estimation are discussed and illustrated.

Despite the pathophysiological clarification of this cognitive disorder, novel molecular and cellular pathways should be identified to determine its exact mechanism. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by senile plaques comprising beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau as a microtubule-associated protein with a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. Periodontitis through inflammatory pathways is a risk factor for deteriorating cognitive impairment in AD patients. Poor oral hygiene coupled with immunocompromised status in older adults causes periodontal diseases and chronic inflammations through an oral bacterial imbalance. Toxic bacterial products, including bacteria themselves, can reach the central nervous system through the bloodstream and evoke inflammatory responses. The present review was conducted to investigate relationships between AD and periodontitis-involved bacteria as a risk factor.

As a plant-derived natural chemical, biologically engineering microorganisms to produce germacrene A to be converted to beta-elemene harbors great expectations since chemical synthesis and plant isolation methods come with their production deficiencies. In this study, we report the design of an Escherichia coli cell factory for the de novo production of germacrene A to be converted to beta-elemene from a simple carbon source. A series of systematic approaches of engineering the isoprenoid and central carbon pathways, translational and protein engineering of the sesquiterpene synthase, and exporter engineering yielded high-efficient beta-elemene production. Specifically, deleting competing pathways in the central carbon pathway ensured the availability of acetyl-coA, pyruvate, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate for the isoprenoid pathways. Adopting lycopene color as a high throughput screening method, an optimized NSY305N was obtained via error-prone polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. Further overexpression of key pathway enzymes, exporter genes, and translational engineering produced 1161.09 mg/L of beta-elemene in a shake flask. Finally, we detected the highest reported titer of 3.52 g/L of beta-elemene and 2.13 g/L germacrene A produced by an E. coli cell factory in a 4-L fed-batch fermentation. The systematic engineering reported here generally applies to microbial production of a broader range of chemicals. This illustrates that rewiring E. coli central metabolism is viable for producing acetyl-coA-derived and pyruvate-derived molecules cost-effectively.

Landowners often clear forest patches for alternative use, creating landscape mosaics of different land-use legacies. Ecological restoration is usually monitored by aboveground processes, while belowground processes are far less studied. We addressed how the abundance and activity of nutrient improvement bacteria contribute to restoration success, considering different restoration interventions and land-use legacies. We assessed the abundance and potential activity of N-fixing and P-mineralizing bacteria in the rhizosphere of 279 two-year-old Quercus mexicana plantlets in a disturbed oak forest in central Mexico. We analyzed the differences across landscape patches (eroded landslide, pastureland, and forest) of four common restoration interventions: passive restoration, artificial shading, topsoil translocation, and combining both treatments. Restoration interventions modified soil functioning differently across landscape patches with a significant increase of P-mineralizing bacteria abundance and potential activity in the landslide and pastureland. In contrast, N-fixing bacteria increased only in the landslide site where we registered the lowest organic matter content. Surprisingly, interventions that enhance bacterial activity and abundance do not necessarily improve short-term seedling performance. We recommend considering the landscape heterogeneity to better match the restoration interventions with the prevailing degradation factor in each landscape patch. Also, combining restoration strategies does not necessarily result in synergy and may imply a useless expense of resources. Finally, monitoring soil health provides novel insights to understand restoration trajectories that remain undetected when focusing only on seedling performance.	[Garcia, Rosaura G.

Composites of h-BN/SCFs/PTFE with MP1100 at 0, 8, 16, 24, and 32 wt% were prepared. The pin-on-disc device was used to evaluate the friction properties of composites, and wear mechanisms against duplex stainless steel was examined. The experimental results show that MP1100 micropowder improves composite mechanical properties, friction coefficient, and wear resistance of composites. A 78.4% drop in wear rate was measured for 24 wt% MP1100. Such decrease in wear rate is explained based on changes in composite molecular structure, a transfer film formed by the absorption of debris, and the formation of chemically reacted polar group compounds on the steel disc.

Aims: To analyze the prevalence of symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety disorder in field hockey players of different skill levels and to compare it to the general population. Methods: Male and female hockey players from different leagues were asked to answer questions on player characteristics, the Centre of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Results: One hundred and eighty-seven players (incl. 54 first and 28 second league players) participated in the study (response rate 97.4%). More than a third (n = 64; 35.0%) reported to be affected by an injury/health complaint, but 157 (86.3%) were able to train and play without limitations. The CES-D score indicated depression symptoms in more female (n = 15; 18.3%) than male (n = 5; 4.8%) players (chi 2=8.8; p < 0.01). No male and one female player had symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Players who played 60 or more matches in the previous 12 months had on average significantly higher depression (t = 2.3; p < 0.05) and generalized anxiety scores (t = 4.2; p < 0.001) than players who played fewer matches. The prevalence of depression and of generalized anxiety symptoms was similar to or lower than in the general population. Although 20 (10.7%) players had depression symptoms, only 4 (2.2%) received psychological counseling or psychotherapy. Conclusion: It is recommended to provide routine screening of mental health problems and low-threshold access to adequate treatment for elite athletes.

The coordination ability of hydroxycalixarene ligands to uranyl and thorium ions could be analyzed by simulating the infrared and ultraviolet-visible spectra, the Wiberg bond energy levels, the energy gaps, and the binding energies. We found that various hydroxycalixarene complexes with uranyl or thorium ions had significant differences in their properties, as well as in their infrared vibrational and ultraviolet absorption spectra. More importantly, different hydroxycalixarenes can be selected based on the adsorption requirements in environments with coexisting uranium and thorium ions. For example, hydroxycalix[4]arene and hydroxycalix[5]arene had a significantly higher binding capacities for thorium than uranyl ions, while hydroxycalix[6]arene showed less of a difference for the two ions but had a good binding ability for both uranyl and thorium ions at the same time. Thus, the use of hydroxycalixarene can achieve the removal of both uranyl and thorium ions in the environment, and the use of specific hydroxycalixarenes may be able to achieve the separation of these ions. These results provide important guidance for the future research of hydroxycalixarene without requiring the synthesis of hydrophilic derivatives, and they may be directly applied to the field of heavy metals.

Adherence to the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) Cancer Prevention Recommendations and cancer risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis	CANCER			English	Review; Early Access						2018 WCRF; AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations; cancer risk; diet; lifestyle; lifestyle score; meta-analysis; physical activity	RESEARCH FUND/AMERICAN INSTITUTE	BackgroundThe World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Cancer Prevention Recommendations are lifestyle-based guidelines that aim to reduce cancer risk. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating associations between a score for adherence to the 2018 Cancer Prevention Recommendations and cancer risk was conducted. MethodsMEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published to November 28, 2022. In meta-analysis, the estimated risk ratios and 95% CIs for adherence score as a continuous (per 1-point increment) and categorical (highest vs. lowest score category) variable using random-effects models were estimated. ResultsEighteen studies (11 cohort; seven case-control) were included investigating incidence of breast (n = 7), colorectal (n = 5), prostate (n = 2), lung (n = 2), pancreatic (n = 1), endometrial (n = 1), unknown primary cancer (n = 1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), and overall (any) cancer (n = 1). The summary risk ratio per 1-point increment in adherence score was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.93; I-2 = 76.5%; n = 7) for breast cancer, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91; I-2 = 26.2%; n = 4) for colorectal cancer, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86-0.98, I-2 = 66.0%; n = 2) for lung cancer. There were no significant associations with prostate or other cancers. Meta-analysis results using categorical adherence score variables were consistent with these findings. ConclusionsGreater adherence to the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research Cancer Prevention Recommendations was associated with lower risk of breast, colorectal, and lung cancers. Future studies investigating associations with risk of other forms of cancer are warranted. PROSPERO registration numberCRD42022313327.

AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST			English	Article						cultural consensus analysis; ethics; forensic anthropology	CULTURAL CONSENSUS	Forensic anthropology has recently and publicly grappled with fundamental disciplinary issues-including estimating population affinity, the pursuit of objectivity, and the role of bias in medicolegal contexts-all of which has left the subdiscipline in a state of seeming fracture, with many practitioners worried about its future. Given these concerns, we wondered to what degree polarization exists, if at all, and along what lines. Using the method of cultural consensus analysis, we asked forensic anthropologists: What makes a "good" forensic anthropologist? Our findings suggest that contrary to widespread concern, broad agreement (consensus) exists over the training, experiences, perspectives, and practices forensic anthropologists (n = 103) identified as important for being "good" at what they do. A few points of disagreement emerged-particularly over the issue of neutrality-which dominated the narrative feedback we received. The fault lines of this debate primarily fell along generational lines, with those having earned their degrees earlier believing more strongly in neutrality. This pattern largely maps onto broader (and somewhat routine) disciplinary debates and trends away from positivism, with younger anthropologists more focused on the larger goal of "decolonizing US anthropology" and attending to the antiracist work that figures prominently in anthropology today.

However, as the sleep stage scoring is done manually following visual scoring rules there can be considerable variation in the sleep staging between different scorers. Thus, this study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the inter-rater agreement in sleep staging. A total of 50 polysomnography recordings were manually scored by 10 independent scorers from seven different sleep centres. We used the 10 scorings to calculate a majority score by taking the sleep stage that was the most scored stage for each epoch. The overall agreement for sleep staging was kappa = 0.71 and the mean agreement with the majority score was 0.86. The scorers were in perfect agreement in 48% of all scored epochs. The agreement was highest in rapid eye movement sleep (kappa = 0.86) and lowest in N1 sleep (kappa = 0.41). The agreement with the majority scoring varied between the scorers from 81% to 91%, with large variations between the scorers in sleep stage-specific agreements. Scorers from the same sleep centres had the highest pairwise agreements at kappa = 0.79, kappa = 0.85, and kappa = 0.78, while the lowest pairwise agreement between the scorers was kappa = 0.58. We also found a moderate negative correlation between sleep staging agreement and the apnea-hypopnea index, as well as the rate of sleep stage transitions. In conclusion, although the overall agreement was high, several areas of low agreement were also found, mainly between non-rapid eye movement stages.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of conventional tillage (CT) and DT systems and liming on sugarcane productivity and soil physical attributes. The experiment was conducted in a clayey-textured Rhodic Hapludox soil cultivated with sugarcane for two growing seasons (first and third ratoons) using a randomized block design with four treatments and four repetitions. The treatments consisted of DT without liming (DT0), DT with liming (DT2), CT without liming (CT0) and CT with liming (CT2). In addition to sugarcane stalk and sugar yields, macroporosity (MA), microporosity (MI), total soil porosity (TP), weighted average diameter (WAD), aggregate stability index (ASI), soil penetration resistance (SPR), pH, potential acidity (H + Al), total soil organic carbon (SOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were analysed. DT2 promoted the best soil conservation effect on sugarcane. In general, DT, regardless of lime application, reduced SOC and POC in soil surface layer. Nevertheless, in the long term, localized lime addition resulted in significant reductions in compaction, reaching values below 2 MPa. The soil fertility improvement provided by DT2 promoted increased sucrose concentrations and stalks yield. Considering that there was an improvement in the physical quality and fertility of soil for better plant development, the deep tillage with localized lime addition can be considered an effective alternative for sugarcane cultivation.

For homogeneous MASs, the consensus conditions, with and without time delays are derived by using a two-sided-looped functional. This less conservative approach takes full account of the information on the intervals delta(t)$$ \delta (t) $$ to delta(tk)$$ \delta \left({t}_k\right) $$ and delta(t)$$ \delta (t) $$ to delta(tk+1)$$ \delta \left({t}_{k+1}\right) $$. On this basis, two aperiodic sampled-data controllers are designed, and additional results on the estimate for the upper bound of the maximum allowable sampling interval are given as well. For heterogeneous MASs, the bounded consensus tracking criterion is derived based on the improved looped functional method. In addition, a corresponding heterogeneous sampled-data controller is designed for each follower to ensure that the consensus tracking error exponentially converges to a bounded ellipsoid region. Finally, three illustrative examples are provided to show the efficiency and superiority of the proposed results.

Physical models have shown great potential for teaching anatomy and enhancing surgical skills. In this article, we introduce an innovative physical anatomy model called "Pelvic+" to teach anatomical relationships in the female pelvis. The Pelvic+ model's value was compared to a traditional lecture in 61 first-year midwifery students randomly allocated to either the Pelvic+ (n = 30) or a control group (n = 32). The primary outcome measure was a quiz comprised of 15 multiple choice questions on pelvic anatomy. Participants were assessed at baseline (Pre-Test), upon completion of the intervention (Post-Test1) and 4 months afterward (Post-Test2). Satisfaction with the approach was assessed at Post-Test1. Increase in knowledge was greater and the approach more accepted among resident midwives when Pelvic+ was used instead of standard lectures. Four months after the intervention, the improvement in knowledge was preserved in the Pelvic+ group. This randomized study demonstrates that the Pelvic+ simulator is more effective than classical learning for pelvic anatomy education, and offers a higher level of satisfaction among students during the educational process. Medical students training in obstetrics and gynecology, or any professional who specializes in the female pelvic floor might also benefit from incorporation of the Pelvic+ model into their training program.

J	Rentmeester, C; Liebzeit, M				Rentmeester, Casey; Liebzeit, Meghan			A Gadamerian approach to nursing: Merging philosophy with practice	NURSING PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						Hans-Georg Gadamer; hermeneutics; Hubert Dreyfus; Patricia Benner; phenomenology		Philosophy is commonly criticized for being too abstract and detached from practical spheres. Upon chronicling how philosophy has gained this reputation, the authors explore the philosophical fields of phenomenology and hermeneutics that have explicitly attempted to merge philosophy with everyday life contexts. In recent decades, phenomenology and hermeneutics have been applied to healthcare. In the realm of nursing, Patricia Benner's nursing theory is especially informed by phenomenology, which is briefly explored through her relationship with one of her mentors, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus. The authors then turn their attention to Hans-Georg Gadamer's philosophy in an attempt to mine concepts relevant to the practice of nursing. Gadamer juxtaposed the human sciences from the natural sciences and thought that both needed different approaches: whereas natural sciences are guided by episteme, that is, universal knowledge, human sciences are guided by phronesis, that is, practical wisdom. Gadamer's philosophy is especially helpful in understanding how to cultivate phronesis in nursing wherein a nurse relies upon one's clinical experience to masterfully navigate each unique patient relationship. Nurses must serve as authorities in the realm of healthcare but also be open to the authority of their patients, who ultimately choose their course of treatment in our contemporary era of patient autonomy. Gadamer's philosophy can help us understand why phronesis requires not only practice but also reflection on that practice to be appropriately cultivated. The authors apply this to the realm of nursing in showing how both practice-clinically and via simulation-and reflection-through journaling or dialogue-are necessary for phronesis to emerge.

Although great efforts have been made in homogenous catalysis, it still remains a huge challenge to drive this reaction via heterogeneous catalysts under mild conditions. Herein, a single-atom Au loaded MgAl-layered double hydroxide (Au-1-MgAl-LDH) with a well-defined structure, in which the Au single atoms are located on the top of Al3+ with Au-O-4 coordination as revealed by extended x-ray-absorption fine-structure (EXAFS)and density-functional theory (DFT)calculation is reported. The photocatalytic results prove the Au-1-MgAl-LDH is capable of driving benzene oxidation reaction with O-2 in water, and exhibits a high selectivity of 99% for phenol. While contrast experiment shows a approximate to 99% selectivity for aliphatic acid with Au nanoparticle loaded MgAl-LDH (Au-NP-MgAl-LDH). Detailed characterizations confirm that the origin of the selectivity difference can be attributed to the profound adsorption behavior of substrate benzene with Au single atoms and nanoparticles. For Au-1-MgAl-LDH, single Au-C bond is formed in benzene activation and result in the production of phenol. While for Au-NP-MgAl-LDH, multiple Au-C bonds are generated in benzene activation, leading to the crack of C-C bond.

The future (i.e., the mid and late 21st century) climate is projected to result in increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events, which could negatively affect the hydroecological function of the wetlands. Wetland management practices have commonly been implemented to protect wetlands and their functions, but it is not clear whether the current management practices can still be effective in projected climate change scenarios. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the runoff and total phosphorus (TP) of natural (L28 Gap) and managed (L28) wetland watersheds in the Western Everglades. For the assessment, we employed future climate projections made using 29 general circulation models (GCMs) and the Watershed Assessment Model (WAM), a watershed loading model. The WAM was calibrated and validated for the baseline period (2000-2014), and the bias-corrected climate projections were incorporated into the model to project the runoff discharge and TP loads for the near-future (2030-2044) and far-future (2070-2084) periods in two carbon emission scenarios. The modeling results show that the natural wetland watershed would be more vulnerable to projected climate change than the managed wetland watershed. The impact of projected climate change scenarios on daily runoff and TP loads was modulated by water control facilities and practices in the managed watershed, highlighting the significance of watershed management practices for improved water quality under projected climate change. This study demonstrates how the local natural and managed wetland watersheds distinctly respond to the global-scale changes and emphasizes the role of water management practices in wetland basins, which are expected to help develop effective climate change adaptation plans for improved sustainability of wetland systems.

However, poor polymer-polymer miscibility and entanglement of long polymer chains are still the main challenges to form desirable active layer morphology in such systems. A smooth solidification process is favorable toward realizing a morphology that features ordered molecular orientation and high crystallinity. Herein, morphological control issue in all-polymer PM-OPDs is addressed by modifying film formation kinetics with an insulating polymer blending strategy. The prolonged crystallization process of polystyrene-blended films can form high-ordered molecular arrangements and crystallinity in donor/acceptor phases, leading to improved charge transport properties and suppressed trap states. With boosting the trap-assisted photomultiplication effect, the polystyrene-blended all-polymer PM-OPD with a high specific detectivity of 4.0 x 10(13) Jones can be achieved due to the accumulation of enhanced photogenerated electrons at the interface and the efficient injection of external holes, which is one of the best detectivity values reported for PM-OPDs. This study not only reveals valuable insights into the effects of insulating polymers on the film formation kinetics mechanism, but also provides novel strategy to fabricate high-performance all-polymer PM-OPDs.

J	Yang, CX; Zhu, ZH; Yi, R; Qiu, HB				Yang, Cunxiang; Zhu, Zhihao; Yi, Ran; Qiu, Hongbo			Influence of the Electromagnetic Characteristics in Air Region on High-Speed Permanent Magnet Generator Based on Multi-Physical Field	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						high-speed permanent magnet generator; analytical calculation; electromagnetic vibration; harmonic response analysis; 3-D temperature field		The cooling performance of the machine with the closed liquid cooling system is excellent. However, the electromagnetic characteristics of the oil separator which sealing the cooling oil in the stator side can have a significant impact on the performance of the machine. In this paper, a liquid cooling structure with the magnetic oil separator is proposed. Taking the 20 000 rpm high-speed permanent magnet generator as an example, the influence of the electromagnetic parameters of the magnetic oil separator on the generator output performance is studied by the analytical calculation and the finite element method, and the mechanism of the nonlinear variation of the generator output performance with the permeability of the oil separator is obtained. The influence of the oil separator on the air-gap magnetic field and electromagnetic force is analyzed, and the reduction mechanism of the different permeability of the oil separator on the harmonic magnetic field and radial force is revealed. The vibration acceleration response of the generator stator is obtained through the modal and harmonic response analysis, it is confirmed that the magnetic oil separator has the effect of reducing vibration. In addition, the 3-D temperature field calculation model of the generator is established, the influence of the thermal parameters of the oil separator on the internal heat exchange of the generator is studied, and the temperature distribution is obtained. Finally, experiments on the electromagnetic performance and temperature rise of the prototype are carried out to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.

Its wide distribution has mainly been facilitated by several breeding programs and widespread dissemination of genetically improved strains. In the first Nile tilapia study exploiting a whole-genome pooled sequencing (Poolseq) approach, we identified the genetic structure and signatures of selection in diverse, farmed Nile tilapia populations, with a particular focus on the GIFT strain, developed in the 1980s, and currently managed by WorldFish (GIFTw). We also investigated important farmed strains from The Philippines and Africa. Using both SNP array data and Poolseq SNPs, we characterized the population structure of these samples. We observed the greatest separation between the Asian and African populations and greater admixture in the Asian populations than in the African ones. We also established that the SNP array data were able to successfully resolve relationships between these diverse Nile tilapia populations. The Poolseq data identified genomic regions with high levels of differentiation (F-ST) between GIFTw and the other populations. Gene ontology terms associated with mesoderm development were significantly enriched in the genes located in these regions. A region on chromosome Oni06 was genetically differentiated in pairwise comparisons between GIFTw and all other populations. This region contains genes associated with muscle-related traits and overlaps with a previously published QTL for fillet yield, suggesting that these traits may have been direct targets for selection on GIFT. A nearby region was also identified using XP-EHH to detect genomic differentiation using the SNP array data. Genomic regions with high or extended homozygosity within each population were also identified. This study provides putative genomic landmarks associated with the recent domestication process in several Nile tilapia populations, which could help to inform their genetic management and improvement.

Thus, we tested the differential effects of epidemic threat on three facets of right-wing authoritarianism, in Germany (a country with high authorities' efficacy in responses to COVID-19) and Poland (low authorities' efficacy context). Two representative sample longitudinal studies performed in Poland (N = 892) and Germany (N = 883) showed that in Germany feelings of COVID-19 threat explained increases in authoritarian submission and (to a lesser extent) authoritarian aggression, whereas in Poland such feelings of threat explained changes in authoritarian aggression and conventionalism after the pandemic, but did not alter authoritarian submission. These findings suggest that specific authoritarian reactions to threat (submissive vs. conventionalist) might depend on the general trust in authorities' ability to respond to crises.

However, the blood brain barrier (BBB) severely prevents therapeutic agents from entering the brain; meanwhile, the non-targeted distribution of agents always causes side effects to vulnerable cerebral tissues. Therefore, delivery systems that possess both BBB penetrability and precise glioma targeting ability are keenly desired. We herein proposed a hybrid cell membrane (HM) camouflage strategy to construct therapeutic nanocomposites, in which HM consisting of brain metastatic breast cancer cell membrane and glioma cell membrane was prepared with a simple membrane fusion pathway. By coating HM onto drug-loaded nanoparticles, the as-obtained biomimetic therapeutic agent (termed HMGINPs) inherited satisfying BBB penetrability and homologous glioma targeting ability simultaneously from the two source cells. HMGINPs exhibited good biocompatibility and superior therapeutic efficacy towards early-stage glioma.

J	de Matos, MO; Bernardes, SF				de Matos, Marta Osorio; Bernardes, Sonia Figueira			Helpful social support for chronic pain in long- term care residents: "<i>With a little help I manage on my own</i>"	NURSING OPEN			English	Article; Early Access						chronic pain; formal caregivers; long-term care facilities; social support	OLDER-ADULTS	Aims and Objectives: To understand older adults' experiences of receiving formal pain-related social support and to identify which caregivers' responses are perceived as (un)helpful to chronic pain adjustment. Background: Chronic pain is highly prevalent in long-term care residents, negatively impacting their psychological, physical and social functioning. However, research has lacked to address the extent to which residents' experiences with staff responses, to their pain, may influence chronic pain outcomes. Design: Qualitative study. Methods: Twenty-nine older adults (7 men, 22 women, M-age = 87.7) were interviewed online through semi-structured interviews, and a thematic analysis was conducted. COREQ guidelines were followed. Results: Two main themes emerged: (1) support during a pain crisis aiming at its relief and (2) support with daily activities because of pain to overcome pain interference. Findings indicate pain-related support is helpful when residents feel their psychological and functional autonomy is protected, and the interactions convey connection and intimacy. Furthermore, residents actively try to shape the support to be received. Also, gender roles and expectations seem to influence pain-related supportive interactions. Conclusion: Pain-related social support may contribute to the maintenance of older adults' health status and autonomy, ensuring a fulfilling and healthy aging process despite chronic pain. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Findings can inform effective pain-related care practices in long-term care, regarding (1) how residents can shape the support they need; (2) which kind of support should be provided, and (3) how caregivers and organizations should provide pain-related support. Patient or Public Contribution: Older adults who participated in the study were recruited from 3 long-term care facilities in Lisbon, in which they resided for longer than 3 months, had persistent/intermittent pain for more than 3 months; were able to maintain a conversation, recollect real episodes, and to fully provide informed consent to participate.

A total of 40 female calves were divided into four treatment groups (n = 10): basal diet +0.015% essential oil, basal diet +0.03% AMP, basal diet +0.15% TB, and basal diet +0.03% AMP + 0.15% TB. AMP and TB supplementation increased the average daily gain (ADG) and weaning weight, while reducing diarrhea occurrence. Additionally, AMP and TB supplementation reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde (MDA), while increasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels. However, the combined use of AMP and TB did not significantly affect the average daily feed intake, ADG, weaning weight, or diarrhea incidence but decreased ROS levels, while increasing SOD levels as well as MDA and IgM levels. Moreover, AMP and TG supplementation increased the relative abundance of several beneficial fiber- and mucin-degrading bacteria in the gut, in contrast to combined AMP and TB supplementation. The 16S rRNA results showed that AMP supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes group (p < .01), and significantly decreased the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group (p < .01). The TB supplementation significantly increased the abundances of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 (p < .01), and significantly decreased the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group (p < .01). The combined use of AMP and TB significantly increased the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Bacteroides (p < .01), and significantly decreased the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes group and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group (p < .01). In summary, diets supplemented with either AMP or TB improved the intestinal microflora, growth performance, and health of weaned calves, but combined use was detrimental to calf performance.

However, there is a paucity of data with which to compare the efficacy and safety of second- and third-generation TKIs in patients with NSCLC carrying uncommon EGFR mutations.Methods We compared the efficacy and safety of second- and third-generation TKIs in all NSCLC patients in whom next-generation sequencing confirmed uncommon EGFR mutations, including G719X, S768I, and L861Q. The parameters analyzed included the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The rate of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reflected the safety of these TKIs.Results Eighty-four NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations were enrolled between April 2016 and May 2022 at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, including 63 treated with second-generation TKIs and 21 treated with third-generation TKIs. The ORR for all patients receiving TKIs was 47.6%, and the DCR was 86.9%. The median PFS for NSCLC patients with uncommon EGFR mutations receiving TKIs was 11.9 months and OS was 30.6 months. There was no significant difference in PFS after treatment with second- or third-generation TKIs (13.3 vs. 11.0 months, respectively, P = 0.910) or in OS (30.6 vs. 24.6 months, respectively P = 0.623). The third-generation TKIs showed no severe toxicity.Conclusions The efficacy of second- and third-generation TKIs for NSCLC with uncommon EGFR mutations does not differ, and so can be used to treat NSCLC patients with these mutations.

Intraspecific variation in feeding and locomotor kinematics during prey capture in redbreast sunfish (<i>Lepomis auritus</i>)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						feeding; intraspecific variation; locomotion; prey capture; repeatability	BLUEGILL SUNFISH; LARGEMOUTH BASS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; AFRICAN CATFISH; TELEOST FISHES; FLUID SPEED; SUCTION; PERFORMANCE; MECHANICS	Biomechanics research often revolves around understanding traits impacting suction feeding performance in fishes, using freshwater ray-finned sunfishes (Family Centrarchidae) as models. However, simultaneous feeding and locomotion kinematics during prey capture are not recorded for many species and there is less information on how these kinematics vary within a species and within individuals. To (1) add to existing data on the prey capture kinematics of centrarchids, (2) assess variation in a species both within and across individuals, and (3) compare morphology and prey capture kinematics of well-sampled centrarchids, we filmed five redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) at 500 fps(-1) approaching and striking non-evasive prey. Redbreast approach prey at similar to 30 cm s(-1) and use approximately 70% of their maximum gape size. Traits related to feeding are more repeatable than traits related to locomotion. However, the Accuracy Index (AI) was consistent across individuals (AI = 0.76 +/- 0.07). Functionally, redbreast sunfish are more similar to bluegill sunfish but morphologically they fall in the intermediate morphospace alongside green sunfish when compared with other centrarchids. These data show that whole organism outcomes (AI) are similar despite variation present both within and across individuals and demonstrate the importance of considering both interspecific and intraspecific differences in the functional diversity of ecologically and evolutionarily important behaviors such as prey capture.

The metal and additive free method offers an easy route to various substituted indolizine derivatives with good functional group tolerance and delivering acceptable good yields (up to 93%). A gram-scale synthesis and further product derivatization show the synthetic potential of this technique. The significance of these findings for medicinal chemistry makes this easy and green approach relevant to both medicinal and synthetic organic chemists, given the crucial role of indolizine in the pharmaceutical industry.

AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS			English	Article; Early Access						cross-border financial spillover; financial stability; international coordination; macroprudential policy; risk contagion	SPILLOVERS; CREDIT; CHINA; CHANNEL	We construct a core-periphery theoretical model based on the cross-border spillover effects of macroprudential policies, to calculate the financial stability gains from macroprudential policy coordination between the two countries. Numerical simulation results show that the gains from coordination between the core and the periphery are zero when facing reverse monetary policy shocks, when macroprudential policy coordination is not needed; however, in the case of high simultaneous loosening (tightening) of monetary policies in both countries, the macroprudential policy coordination mechanism can reduce the negative externalities of cross-border financial spillovers and increase the total gains from financial stability; the total gains from macroprudential policy coordination increase as the peripheral macroprudential policy operating space decreases, the degree of cross-border financial spillovers increases, and the degree of cross-border spillovers from core monetary policy increases. Therefore, the international coordination of macroprudential policies has certain possibilities and necessities.

Herein, mesoporous Co3O4 (mCo(3)O(4)-350) showed excellent catalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic-alkanes, especially for oxidation of ethylbenzene with a conversion of 42 % and selectivity of 90 % for acetophenone at 120 degrees C. Notably, mCo(3)O(4) presented a unique catalytic path of direct oxidation of aromatic-alkanes to aromatic ketones rather than the conventional stepwise oxidation to alcohols and then to ketones. Density functional theory calculations revealed that oxygen vacancies in mCo(3)O(4) activate around Co atoms, causing electronic state change from Co-(Oh)(3+)-> Co-(Oh)(2+). Co-(Oh)(2+) has great attraction to ethylbenzene, and weak interaction with O-2, which provide insufficient O-2 for gradual oxidation of phenylethanol to acetophenone. Combined with high energy barrier for forming phenylethanol, the direct oxidation path from ethylbenzene to acetophenone is kinetically favorable on mCo(3)O(4), sharply contrasted to non-selective oxidation of ethylbenzene on commercial Co3O4.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of ultrasound signs of recurrent motor branch (RMB) neuropathy in patients with CTS and to correlate imaging findings with clinical and electrophysiological data. MethodsTwo cohorts were recruited, one consisting of CTS patients with electrodiagnostic evidence of prolonged median distal motor latency from wrist to thenar eminence and another consisting of sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Ultrasound reliability of RMB measurement was assessed by the calculation of the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Patients were evaluated with electrodiagnostic tests and asked to complete the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. The difference between the RMB diameter in patients and controls was analyzed using a t test. Correlations between RMB diameter and other parameters were assessed using linear mixed models. Results46 hands from 32 patients with CTS and 50 hands from 50 controls were evaluated. The intra- and interobserver agreements in RMB measurement were very good (ICC = 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.90) and good (ICC = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.87). The RMB diameter was significantly larger in patients than in controls (P < .0001). No significant correlation was found between the RMB diameter and other variables, except for BMI and median nerve cross-sectional area. DiscussionUltrasound is reliable in identifying the RMB and characterizing its abnormalities. In this patient cohort, ultrasound allowed for detection of definite signs of RMB compression neuropathy.

However, there is considerable uncertainty concerning what drought adjustment is and whether plants can adjust to sustained drought. This review focuses on woody plants and synthesises the evidence for drought adjustment in a selection of key above-ground and below-ground plant traits. We assess whether evaluating the drought adjustment of single traits, or selections of traits that operate on the same plant functional axis (e.g. photosynthetic traits) is sufficient, or whether a multi-trait approach, integrating across multiple axes, is required. We conclude that studies on drought adjustments in woody plants might overestimate the capacity for adjustment to drier environments if spatial studies along gradients are used, without complementary experimental approaches. We provide evidence that drought adjustment is common in above-ground and below-ground traits; however, whether this is adaptive and sufficient to respond to future droughts remains uncertain for most species. To address this uncertainty, we must move towards studying trait integration within and across multiple axes of plant function (e.g. above-ground and below-ground) to gain a holistic view of drought adjustments at the whole-plant scale and how these influence plant survival.

Donor-specific antibodies are the main cause of antibody-mediated rejection; in particular, de novo donor-specific antibodies are a risk factor for chronic active antibody-mediated rejection. The level of de novo donor-specific antibodies tends to increase with time throughout long-term graft survival. Donor-specific antibodies induce humoral rejection through complement activation, which results in tissue injury and coagulation. Additionally, complement activation promotes the migration of inflammatory cells through the innate immune response, causing endothelial injury. This inflammatory response may cause persistent glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis, leading to fixed pathological lesions that impair graft function. No treatment has been established for chronic antibody-mediated rejection, a condition in which antibody-mediated rejection becomes irreversible. Thus, antibody-mediated rejection must be detected and treated while it is still reversible. In this review, we discuss the development of de novo donor-specific antibodies and the mechanisms leading to chronic antibody-mediated rejection and summarize the current treatment options and the latest biomarkers for detecting chronic antibody-mediated rejection at an earlier stage.

Environmental inequality and disparities in school readiness: The role of neurotoxic lead	CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access							EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; RACE/ETHNICITY; ECONOMICS; INFERENCE; EDUCATION; HAZARDS; FAMILY; ISSUES; LEVEL	Developmental science has increasingly scrutinized how environmental hazards influence child outcomes, but few studies examine how contaminants affect disparities in early skill formation. Linking research on environmental inequality and early childhood development, this study assessed whether differences in exposure to neurotoxic lead explain sociodemographic gaps in school readiness. Using panel data tracking a representative sample of 1266 Chicago children (50% female, 16% White, 30% Black, 49% Hispanic, mu(age) = 5.2 months at baseline, collected 1994-2002), analyses quantified the contribution of lead contamination to class and racial disparities in vocabulary skills and attention problems at ages 4 and 5. Results suggested that lead contamination explains 15%-25% and 33%-66% of the disparities in each outcome, respectively, although imprecise estimates preclude drawing firm inferences about attention problems.

Here, we identify a moonlighting protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as a regulator of HR repair, which is mediated through HDAC1-dependent regulation of RAD51 stability. Mechanistically, in response to DSBs, Src signaling is activated and mediates GAPDH nuclear translocation. Then, GAPDH directly binds with HDAC1, releasing it from its suppressor. Subsequently, activated HDAC1 deacetylates RAD51 and prevents it from undergoing proteasomal degradation. GAPDH knockdown decreases RAD51 protein levels and inhibits HR, which is re-established by overexpression of HDAC1 but not SIRT1. Notably, K40 is an important acetylation site of RAD51, which facilitates stability maintenance. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the importance of GAPDH in HR repair, in addition to its glycolytic activity, and they show that GAPDH stabilizes RAD51 by interacting with HDAC1 and promoting HDAC1 deacetylation of RAD51.

Herein, we report a new asymmetric synthetic route to cytotrienin A, employing an unexplored approach involving the late-stage installation of a C11 side chain onto the macrolactam core. In this strategy, we utilized the redox properties of hydroquinone and installed a side chain on the sterically hindered C11 hydroxy group by the traceless Staudinger reaction. This study also demonstrated that the boron-Wittig/iterative Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling sequence was effective for the concise and selective construction of the (E,E,E)-conjugated triene moiety. The developed route opens new opportunities for the structure-activity relationship studies of the side chains of these ansamycin antibiotics and the preparation of other synthetic analogs and chemical probes for further biological studies.

The extremely low surface density of the single-atom sites and the inflexibility in manipulating their geometric/electronic configurations, however, compromise the H2O2 yield and impede further performance enhancement. Herein, we construct a family of multiatom catalysts (MACs), on which two or three single atoms are closely coordinated to form high-density active sites that are versatile in their atomic configurations for optimal adsorption of essential *OOH species. Among them, the Co-x-Ni MAC presents excellent electrocatalytic performance for 2e(-) ORR, in terms of its exceptionally high H2O2 yield in acidic electrolytes (28.96 mol L-1 g(cat.)(-1) h(-1)) and high selectivity under acidic to neutral conditions in a wide potential region (>80%, 0-0.7 V). Operando X-ray absorption and density functional theory analyses jointly unveil its unique trimetallic Co2NiN8 configuration, which efficiently induces an appropriate Ni-d orbital filling and modulates the *OOH adsorption, together boosting the electrocatalytic 2e(-) ORR capability. This work thus provides a new MAC strategy for tuning the geometric/electronic structure of active sites for 2e(-) ORR and other potential electrochemical processes.

MethodsParents of 181 children with cerebral palsy, aged 0-18, participated in this cross-sectional-descriptive study. "Sociodemographic Form," "Spiritual Orientation Scale," "Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale," and "Gross Motor Function Classification System" were used to collect data. ResultsThe mothers who participated in the study had a mean age of 35.74 +/- 5.94 years. The study showed that 17.1% of children with cerebral palsy did not receive special education, and 92.8% of them were born with a disability. Additionally, 62.4% of the children were found to be undernourished, 48.6% had irregular oral care, 43.1% had semi-active activity, 65.7% had irregular sleeping patterns, and 50.8% only partially understood what was stated.The study discovered that as mothers' ages increased, their spiritual orientation decreased, and their burden of caring increased. Furthermore, the mothers of children with severe disabilities had an increasing burden of care, as indicated by the gross motor classification. ConclusionsThe study found that mothers with higher spiritual orientation scores perceived less care burden. These findings suggest the need for implementing activities to provide moral support to mothers.

The impact of the inhibitory spillover effect on eating behaviour	EUROPEAN EATING DISORDERS REVIEW			English	Article						eating behaviour; inhibitory spillover effect; obesity; self-control	FOOD-INTAKE; OBESITY; OVERWEIGHT; WEIGHT; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; ANXIETY; STYLE; LIFE	Objective: Overweight and obesity are global problems with negative physical, social, and psychological outcomes. Besides other factors, inhibitory control deficits contribute to weight gain and development of overweight. The inhibitory spillover effect (ISE) improves inhibitory control through transfer of inhibitory control capacity from one domain to an unrelated, second domain. For ISE to occur, one inhibitory control task is executed simultaneously with a second, non-control related task thereby increasing inhibitory control in this task.Method: In this preregistered study, we tested the ISE induced through thought suppression in contrast to a neutral task in participants with normal weight and overweight (N = 92). A simultaneously conducted bogus taste test served as outcome measure for food intake.Results: We found neither an interaction effect between group affiliation and condition nor an effect of group affiliation. However, contrary to our expectations, we found higher food intake in participants with active ISE compared to the neutral task.Conclusions: This result might indicate rebound effects of applied thought suppression which led to the experience of loss of control and therefore undermined maintenance and function of the ISE. This main result was robust to all moderator variables. We elaborate further factors for the finding, theoretical implications, and future research directions.

The work herein aimed to compare effects of four main betalains on inflammatory and cell-protective markers and to highlight potential structure-related relationships of the two main subgroups: betacyanins vs betaxanthins.Methods and results: Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide following incubation with betacyanins (betanin, neobetanin) and betaxanthins (indicaxanthin, vulgaxanthin I) in concentrations from 1 to 100 mu M. All betalains suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-1 beta, iNOS, and COX-2 with tendency for stronger effects of betacyanins compared to betaxanthins. In contrast, HO-1 and gGCS showed mixed and only moderate induction, while more emphasized effects were observed for betacyanins. While all betalains suppressed mRNA levels of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX-2), a superoxide generating enzyme, only betacyanins were able to counteract hydrogen peroxide induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, in alignment with their radical scavenging potential. Furthermore, betaxanthins exerted pro-oxidant properties, elevating ROS production beyond hydrogen peroxide stimulation.Conclusion: In summary, all betalains display anti-inflammatory properties, although only betacyanins demonstrate radical scavenging capacities, indicating potential differing responses under oxidative stress conditions, which requires further research.

Silane-functionalized polymers have found a wide range of potential applications, such as adhesives, rubbers, and drug delivery agents. For decades, the hydrosilylation for the post-modification of polymers has typically used transition metals as catalysts. Metal-free hydrosilylation strategies that can avoid metal residues in polymers are largely lacking in this field. Herein, we report the photocatalytic metal-free radical hydrosilylation strategy for the post-modification of polymers bearing pendant vinyl groups using the organic photocatalyst and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst under blue light irradiation. We used monofunctional silanes to functionalize polymers and the bis(silane)s as crosslinkers to prepare crosslinked polymers.

Sound restitution also seeks to level the epistemological divide resulting from conventional archiving. The groundbreaking, collaborative reactivations taking place in South America explored within the three articles in this journal issue are presented. External researchers and local co-researchers join forces to create shared soundscapes on an equitable basis; they develop innovative research designs for restitution and participate in webs of collaboration that take into account the recuperation of sound traditions that expert vocalists and instrumentalists, grassroots researchers, Indigenous leaders, and cultural entrepreneurs have independently initiated. Finally, the inclusion of co-researchers in the curatorship of museum exhibitions and the need to identify anyone who may claim rights to oratory, music, and dance is addressed.

Overexpression of LAG-3 enables cancer cells to escape immune surveillance, while its blockade reinvigorates exhausted T cells and strengthens anti-infection immunity. Blockade of LAG-3 may have antitumor effects. Here, we generated a novel anti-LAG-3 chimeric antibody, 405B8H3(D-E), through hybridoma technology from monoclonal antibodies produced in mice. The heavy-chain variable region of the selected mouse antibody was grafted onto a human IgG4 scaffold, while a modified light-chain variable region was coupled to the human kappa light-chain constant region. 405B8H3(D-E) could effectively bind LAG-3-expressing HEK293 cells. Moreover, it could bind cynomolgus monkey (cyno) LAG-3 expressed on HEK293 cells with a higher affinity than the reference anti-LAG-3 antibody BMS-986016. Furthermore, 405B8H3(D-E) promoted interleukin-2 secretion and was able to block the interactions of LAG-3 with liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin and major histocompatibility complex II molecules. Finally, 405B8H3(D-E) combined with anti-mPD-1-antibody showed effective therapeutic potential in the MC38 tumor mouse model. Therefore, 405B8H3(D-E) is likely to be a promising candidate therapeutic antibody for immunotherapy.

J	Galvin, BM; Badura, K; LePine, J; LePine, M				Galvin, Benjamin M.; Badura, Katie; LePine, Jeffrey; LePine, Marcie			A theoretical integration of leader emergence and leadership effectiveness: Over, under, and congruent emergence	JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR			English	Review; Early Access						leader effectiveness; leader emergence; leadership	ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICS; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; STEREOTYPE THREAT; METAANALYTIC TEST; JOB DEMANDS; GENDER; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; NARCISSISM; TEAMS	There is a long and rich history of research on the concept of leader emergence. Much of this research positions leader emergence alongside leadership effectiveness as an epiphenomenal criterion in leadership research. Although this view has enhanced our understanding of factors that influence leader emergence and leadership effectiveness individually, our understanding of the potential alignment or misalignment of these concepts remains opaque. Following from this, we are left with unanswered questions concerning how, why, and under what conditions do the right or wrong leaders emerge or fail to emerge. Theory that develops insights into these questions is needed to advance our understanding of leadership and to cope with challenges of identifying and developing effective leaders and maximizing leadership potential in organizations. By integrating theories of leader emergence and leadership effectiveness-and considering their implications jointly-we provide a conceptual basis for identifying and understanding a more complete range of leader emergence than has been suggested in the literature. Importantly, our theoretical frame explains how our leader emergence types-over-emergence, under-emergence, congruent emergence, and congruent non-emergence-are differentially associated with a common set of factors. In doing so, we illuminate tradeoffs that might accompany different interventions intended to enhance leadership in organizations.

Group 1 consisted of 86 eyes with no myopic retinal degenerative lesion (C0). Group 2 consisted of 71 eyes with tessellated fundus (C1). Group 3 consisted of 32 eyes with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy (C2). Retinal vascular density and retinal thickness were measured with optical coherence tomography angiography. The scanning area was a 3 x 3 mm(2) ring with the fovea of the macular. All data were analyzed with the SPSS 23.0 by one-way ANOVA test among comparison groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the relations among measurements. Univariate linear regression showed a correlation between the vascular densities and retinal thicknesses.Results: The microvessel density significantly decreased and significant thinning of the superior and temporal macular thickness in the C2 group. The vascular densities of macular decreased significantly with the increase of axial length (AL) and refractive diopter in the C2 group. The retinal thicknesses of the macular fovea increased significantly with the increase of vascular densities in the C0 group and C1 group.Conclusions: The impairment of retinal microstructure is more likely related to reduced oxygen and nutrients due to microvessel density decreases.

We hypothesized that intercropping African marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) with zucchini squash will encourage an abundance of beneficial arthropods and increase cultural and biological control against these key insect pests by significantly reducing their populations and consequently improve yields. In a 2-year field experiment, five treatments were evaluated in a randomized complete block design consisting of four replicates. Three diversified cropping treatments were implemented: (1) intercropping squash with marigold, (2) intercropping squash with cowpea, (3) intercropping squash with marigold and cowpea (mixed). These treatments were compared with an organic grower standard insecticide, (4) M-Pede (potassium salts of naturally derived fatty acids) sprayed on monocropped squash and (5) monocropped squash with no pest management (control). Results indicated that squash intercropped with marigolds accounted for the highest marketable yields. Squash intercropped with cowpea had marginally high yields but attracted the highest densities of aphids. M-Pede did not increase squash yields, but reduced aphids, whiteflies and associated squash silverleaf (SSL) disorder ratings and showed no deleterious effect on populations of natural enemies. We conclude that a mixture of marigold and cowpea could be used to suppress pests by increasing beneficial arthropod diversity while enhancing marketable yields of organic squash. M-Pede could be used as a last resort when experiencing high hemipteran pressure.

MethodsThe sample of the research consisted of 315 elderly individuals. Data were collected using a personal information form, an elder abuse assessment form, and the Geriatric Depression Scale. ResultsEmotional abuse, neglect, economic abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse were detected in 51.4%, 35.6%, 21.9%, 3.8%, and 0.03% of the elderly individuals, respectively. It was observed that elderly individuals in the advanced age group (75-95 years) experienced only emotional abuse, while women, single persons, those with low education levels, those without income of their own, and those who could not perform their self-care experienced both emotional abuse and neglect to a greater extent (P < 0.05). A total of 68.3% of the elderly individuals showed symptoms of depression at a significant level. The elderly individuals who were exposed to physical and emotional abuse and neglect had higher mean depression scores compared to those who were not (P < 0.05). ConclusionsThe study showed that the severity of depression and prevalence of emotional abuse, neglect, financial abuse, and physical abuse were high among older adults. Mental health professionals have a very critical role in recognizing, detecting, and managing elder abuse and they should investigate elder abuse by integrating it into routine screening, especially in high-risk populations. It is recommended that guidelines for the detection and treatment of abuse and neglect be prepared and implemented.

AimsThe purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how clients with aphasia experience engagement during their inpatient aphasia rehabilitation. Methods & ProceduresAn interpretative phenomenological analysis approach guided the study design and analysis. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with nine clients with aphasia, recruited through purposive sampling, during their inpatient rehabilitation admission. Analysis was completed using a variety of analytic techniques including coding, memoing, triangulation between coders and team discussion. Outcomes & ResultsThe analysis revealed that for clients with aphasia in the acute phrase of recovery, the rehabilitation process resembles travelling on a journey through a foreign land. Successful engagement in the journey was accomplished when one had a therapist who served as a trusted guide and was able to be a friend, invested, adaptable, a co-creator, encouraging and dependable. Conclusions & ImplicationsEngagement is a dynamic, multifaceted and person-centred process involving the client, provider and rehabilitation context. Findings from this work have implications for measuring engagement, training student clinicians to be skilled facilitators in engaging their clients and implementing person-centred practices that promote engagement within clinical settings. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSWhat is already known on the subjectEngagement is recognized as an important factor in rehabilitation treatment response and outcomes. Prior literature suggests that the therapist plays a critical role in facilitating engagement within the client-provider relationship. Communication impairments associated with aphasia may negatively impact a client's ability to develop interpersonal connections and participate in the rehabilitation process. There is a dearth of research directly exploring the topic of engagement in aphasia rehabilitation, particularly from the perspective of clients with aphasia. Capturing the client perspective can provide novel insights regarding practices to foster and maintain engagement in aphasia rehabilitation. What this paper adds to existing knowledgeThis interpretative phenomenological study revealed that for individuals with aphasia in the acute phase of recovery, the rehabilitation process resembles travelling on a sudden and foreign journey. Successful engagement in the journey was accomplished when one had a therapist who served as a 'trusted guide' and was able to be a friend, invested, adaptable, a co-creator, encouraging and dependable. Through the client experience, engagement is seen as a dynamic, multifaceted and person-centred process involving the client, provider and rehabilitation context. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?The current study highlights the complexity and nuance of engagement within the rehabilitation context, which has implications for measuring engagement, training student clinicians to be skilled in engaging their clients and implementing person-centred practices that promote engagement within clinical settings. It is necessary to recognize that client and provider interactions (and thus engagement) are embedded in and influenced by the broader healthcare system. With this in mind, a patient-centred approach to engagement in aphasia care delivery cannot be achieved through individual efforts only and may require prioritization and action at the systems level. Future work is needed to explore barriers and facilitators to enacting engagement practices, in order to develop and test strategies to support practice change.

J	Andrade, AJ; Saron, C				Andrade Junior, Antonio Jose; Saron, Clodoaldo			Mechanical recycling of expanded polystyrene and tire rubber waste as compatibilized and toughened blends	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						blends; expanded polystyrene; polymer; recycling; rubber tire; toughness	NATURAL-RUBBER; MORPHOLOGY	Packaging represents a significant source of all polymer waste produced in the world. Thus, improving recycling methods is essential to achieve an environmentally sustainable condition since the volume of produced polymer and of related waste has grown. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam is a thermoplastic with important performance of properties such as thermal isolation and absorption of mechanical energy that allow large application in packaging and other segments. However, the EPS recycling is a challenger due to its low density and poor properties. The rubber incorporation to the recycled EPS is an alternative for the toughening of the polymer matrix as well as improving its mechanical properties. In present study, EPS waste from electric and electronic products packaging was treated by three distinct methods for polymer densification and after it was thermo-mechanically processed by extrusion with variable content of ground tire rubber (GTR) and compatibilizer agent styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) copolymer to produce compatibilized and toughened PS/rubber blends. Mechanical, thermal and rheological properties of materials were evaluated by different analyses. The incorporation of rubber to the recycled EPS has significantly improved the mechanical properties of the material and the presence of the SBS agent was effective to compatibilize the PS/rubber blends. Therefore, the preparation of compatibilized PS/rubber blends showed to be a way to the mechanical recycling of EPS and rubber tires waste.

Its potential in the field of fabricating drug delivery systems, by virtue of processing biocompatible polymers, has been very lucrative. This work aims to tap the interstitial drug delivery kinetics that are often inaccessible through machine-specific infill patterns in additive manufactured tablets fabricated using PVA biopolymer as an excipient. In this regard, a myo-inositol containing tablet has been printed using Fused Deposition Modeling preceded by Hot Melt Extrusion drug loading route. Two machine-specific infill patterns were taken, namely straight and grid. Later, these two distinct patterns were juxtaposed to obtain novel hybrid infill patterns in the tablets. Then, these tablets and their filament were subjected to various thermal, mechanical, imaging and pharmaceutical characterization tests to assess the feasibility of the research attempt. Finally, dissolution tests were conducted to evaluate their dissolution behavior over a time period. The characterization tests proved the scientific viability of this attempt along with amorphous existence of drug in the polymeric filament. The dissolution results showed favorable drug release by achieving interstitial dissolution timings with surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio being found to be the principal factor.

The relaxation mechanisms of magnetization in response to excitation magnetic fields are important features of MNPs. The basic relaxation mechanisms include internal rotation (Neel relaxation) and external physical rotation (Brownian relaxation). Accurate measurement of these relaxation times may provide high sensitivity for predicting MNP types and viscosity-based hydrodynamic states. It is challenging to separately measure the Neel and Brownian relaxation components using sinusoidal excitation in conventional MPI. PurposeWe developed a multi-exponential relaxation spectral analysis method to separately measure the Neel and Brownian relaxation times in the magnetization recovery process in pulsed vascular MPI. MethodsSynomag-D samples with different viscosities were excited using pulsed excitation in a trapezoidal-waveform relaxometer. The samples were excited at different field amplitudes ranging from 0.5 to 10 mT at intervals of 0.5 mT. The inverse Laplace transform-based spectral analysis of the relaxation-induced decay signal in the field-flat phase was performed by using PDCO, a primal-dual interior method for convex objectives. Neel and Brownian relaxation peaks were elucidated and measured on samples with various glycerol and gelatin concentrations. The sensitivity of viscosity prediction of the decoupled relaxation times was evaluated. A digital vascular phantom was designed to mimic a plaque with viscous MNPs and a catheter with immobilized MNPs. Spectral imaging of the digital vascular phantom was simulated by combining a field-free point with homogeneous pulsed excitation. The relationship between the Brownian relaxation time from different tissues and the number of periods for signal averages was evaluated for a scan time estimation in the simulation. ResultsThe relaxation spectra of synomag-D samples with different viscosity levels exhibited two relaxation time peaks. The Brownian relaxation time had a positive linear relationship with the viscosity in the range 0.9 to 3.2 mPa center dot s. When the viscosity was >3.2 mPa center dot s, the Brownian relaxation time saturated and did not change with increasing viscosity. The Neel relaxation time decreased slightly with an increase in the viscosity. The Neel relaxation time exhibited a similar saturation effect when the viscosity level was >3.2 mPa center dot s for all field amplitudes. The sensitivity of the Brownian relaxation time increased with the field amplitude and was maximized at approximately 4.5 mT. The plaque and catheter regions were differentiated from the vessel region in the simulated Brownian relaxation time map. The simulation results show that the Neel relaxation time was 8.33 +/- 0.09 mu s in the plaque region, 8.30 +/- 0.08 mu s in the catheter region, and 8.46 +/- 0.11 mu s in the vessel region. The Brownian relaxation time was 36.60 +/- 2.31 mu s in the plaque region, 30.17 +/- 1.24 mu s in the catheter region, and 31.21 +/- 1.53 mu s in the vessel region. If we used 20 excitation periods for image acquisition in the simulation, the total scan time of the digital phantom was approximately 100 s. ConclusionQuantitative assessment of the Neel and Brownian relaxation times through inverse Laplace transform-based spectral analysis in pulsed excitation, highlighting their potential for use in multi-contrast vascular MPI.

In this way, callus cultures of different genetic backgrounds may be co-cultivated such that cell-to-cell connectivity is achieved as a chimeric tissue is formed. To track intercellular connectivity and transport between non-clonal callus cells, we used transgenic lines expressing fluorescently tagged mobile and non-mobile fusion constructs. Using fluorescently-labelled reporter lines that label plasmodesmata, we show that secondary complex plasmodesmata are present at the cell walls of connected cells. We use this system to investigate cell-to-cell transport across the callus graft junction and show that different proteins and RNAs are mobile between non-clonal callus cells. Finally, we take advantage of the callus culture system to probe intercellular connectivity of grafted leaf and root calli and the effect of different light regimes of cell-to-cell transport. Taking advantage of the ability of callus to be cultivated in the complete absence of light, we show that the rate of silencing spread is significantly decreased in chimeric calli cultivated in total darkness. We propose that callus grafting is a fast and reliable method for analysing the capacity of a macromolecule to be exchanged between cells independent of the vasculature.

BackgroundNursing home caregivers report numerous barriers when it comes to provision of adequate oral care for care-dependent older adults. Among the reported barriers are lack of knowledge and skills, care-resistant behaviours, lack of adequate routines and documentation systems for oral health, a high workload, and unclear responsibilities. To overcome these barriers, a digital tool named SmartJournal was developed to assist caregivers in preserving nursing home residents' oral health. Materials and methodsSemistructured interviews were performed with selected caregivers (n = 12) taking part in SmartJournal testing. A theory-driven thematic analysis based on technology acceptance model was conducted. ResultsSmartJournal was generally described as a userfriendly and useful tool. The initial reaction of the participants was mixed; some were positive, some had concerns, but many seemed to have a neutral stance to the intervention. Both barriers and facilitating factors for SmartJournal usage were revealed. Interestingly, the usage gradually changed from norm-based to routine-based behaviour during the test period. Although the tool was well-accepted, as demonstrated with study participants' willingness to use it in the future, they had several suggestions for improvements to further adapt it to a nursing home setting. ConclusionResults from the present study provide valuable information on questions about SmartJournal acceptance and intervention delivery, thereby preparing the ground for a larger scale evaluation study assessing measurable effects of SmartJournal usage in nursing homes.

In 2005, the first PLT was successfully performed, with support from Belgian experts. This study reviews the implementation of PLT at our center and evaluates the results and challenges. Methods: Implementation of PLT at ND2 required medico-surgical team building and extensive improvement of hospital facilities. Records of 13 transplant recipients from 2005 to 2020 were studied retrospectively. Short--and long--term complications, as well as the survival rates, were reported. Results: The mean follow-up time was 8.3 +/- 5.7 years. Surgical complications included one case of hepatic artery thrombosis that was successfully repaired, one case of colon perforation resulting in death from sepsis, and two cases of bile leak that were drained surgically. PTLD was observed in five patients, of whom three died. There were no cases of retransplantation. The 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year patient survival rates were 84.6%, 69.2%, and 69.2%, respectively. There were no cases of complication or death among the donors. Conclusion: Living-donor PLT was developed at ND2 for providing a life--saving treatment to children with end-stage liver disease. Early surgical complication rate was low, and the patient survival rate was satisfactory at 1 year. Long-term survival decreased considerably due to PTLD. Future challenges include surgical autonomy and improvement of long-term medical follow-up with a particular emphasis on prevention and management of Epstein-Barr virus-related disease.

This article presents a tractable adaptive control scheme for the stochastic nonlinear system with time-varying delays. To mitigate the effects of stochastic uncertainties, an adaptive embedded cubature Kalman filter is developed to realize the robust estimation of the state. Unlike the conventional cubature Kalman filter with fixed construction, a semi-definite programming is designed to adjust the weights of cubature points dynamically. Such programming guarantees the positive definiteness of the error covariance matrix, which enhances the reliability of the filtering procedure. Based on more accurate state estimations, the multidimensional Taylor network (MTN) is utilized to evaluate the dynamic performance under time-varying delays and approximate the optimal policy in the deterministic policy gradient framework. Adaptive tracking control with high computational efficiency is achieved due to the concise topological structure of MTN. The exponential convergence of the state estimation error and the semi-globally uniform ultimate boundness of the tracking error are verified theoretically. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by a numerical simulation based on a practical electric industrial system.

Polymer electrode materials, as compared to small-molecule electrode materials, have the advantage of poor solubility, which is beneficial for achieving high cycling stability. However, the severe entanglement of polymer chains often leads to difficulties in preparing nanostructured polymer electrodes, which is vital for achieving fast reaction kinetics and high utilization of active sites. This study demonstrates that these problems can be solved by the in situ electropolymerization of electrochemically active monomers in nanopores of ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3), combining the advantages of the nano-dispersion and nano-confinement effects of CMK-3 and the insolubility of the polymer materials. The as-prepared nanostructured poly(1-naphthylamine)/CMK-3 cathode exhibits a high active site utilization of 93.7%, ultrafast rate capability of 60 A g(-1) (approximate to 320 C), and an ultralong cycle life of 10000 cycles at room temperature and 45000 cycles at -15 degrees C. The study herein provides a facile and effective method that can simultaneously solve both the dissolution problem of small-molecule electrode materials and the inhomogeneous dispersion issue of polymer electrode materials.

Radiocarbon dating as tool to assist in triaging cases of unidentified human remains in Victoria, Australia: A case series	JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES			English	Article						medicolegal significance; radiocarbon dating; time since death; unidentified human remains		In cases where human remains are unidentified because there is no initial identification hypothesis, limited contextual information, and/or poor preservation, radiocarbon (C-14) dating may be a useful tool to further assist with identification. Through measuring the amount of C-14 remaining in organic material, such as bone, teeth, nail, or hair, radiocarbon dating may provide an estimated year of birth and year of death for a deceased person. This information, may assist in, establishing whether a case of unidentified human remains (UHR) is actually of medicolegal significance and therefore, requires forensic investigation and identification. This case series highlights the application of C-14 dating to seven of the 132 UHR cases in Victoria, Australia. Cortical bone was sampled from each case and the level of C-14 was measured to provide an estimated year of death. Four of the seven cases analyzed contained the levels of C-14 consistent with an archeological timeframe, one contained a level of C-14 consistent with a modern (i.e., of medicolegal significance) timeframe, and the results for the remaining two samples were inconclusive. Applying this technique not only reduced the number of UHR cases in Victoria but also has investigative, cultural, and practical implications for medicolegal casework in general.

Mechanostimulation to stimulate yield and stress resistance of crops is of significant research interest, yet a molecular understanding of transcriptional responses to touch is largely absent in cereals. To address this, we performed whole-genome transcriptomics following mechanostimulation of wheat, barley, and the recent genome-sequenced oat. The largest transcriptome changes occurred +/- 25 min after touching, with most of the genes being upregulated. While most genes returned to basal expression level by 1-2 h in oat, many genes retained high expression even 4 h post-treatment in barley and wheat. Functional categories such as transcription factors, kinases, phytohormones, and Ca2+ regulation were affected. In addition, cell wall-related genes involved in (hemi)cellulose, lignin, suberin, and callose biosynthesis were touch-responsive, providing molecular insight into mechanically induced changes in cell wall composition. Furthermore, several cereal-specific transcriptomic footprints were identified that were not observed in Arabidopsis. In oat and barley, we found evidence for systemic spreading of touch-induced signalling. Finally, we provide evidence that both the jasmonic acid-dependent and the jasmonic acid-independent pathways underlie touch-signalling in cereals, providing a detailed framework and marker genes for further study of (a)biotic stress responses in cereals.

ObjectivesTo assess effortful control in infancy through late childhood as a predictor of repeated measures of body mass index (BMI) from infancy through adolescence, and to examine whether sex moderates the associations. MethodsMaternal report of offspring effortful control and measurements of child BMI were obtained at 7 and 8 time points respectively from 191 gestational parent/child dyads from infancy through adolescence. General linear mixed models were used. ResultsEffortful control at 6 months predicted BMI trajectories from infancy through adolescence, F(5,338) = 2.75, p = 0.03. Further, when effortful control at other timepoints were included in the model, they added no additional explanatory value. Sex moderated the association between 6-month effortful control and BMI, F(4, 338) = 2.59, p = 0.03, with poorer infant effortful control predicting higher BMI in early childhood for girls, and more rapid increases in BMI in early adolescence for boys. ConclusionsEffortful control in infancy was associated with BMI over time. Specifically, poor effortful control during infancy was associated with higher BMI in childhood and adolescence. These findings support the argument that infancy may be a sensitive window for the development of later obesity.

The most commonly observed measure of product availability in practical settings is the fill-rate service level. However, the optimal design of a distribution network that considers the fill rate to control shortages of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is considered intractable and has only been addressed by heuristic methods. This paper addresses the optimal design of a distribution network for FMCG able to provide high fill-rate service level under a continuous review (r,Q)$(r,Q)$ policy. Considering the exact formulation for the provided fill rate, we formulated a joint location-inventory model with fill-rate service level constraints as a convex mixed integer nonlinear problem for which a novel decomposition-based outer approximation algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments have shown that our solution approach provides good-quality solutions that are on average 0.15% and, at worst, 2.2% from the optimal solution.

We examined the mechanisms underlying the exacerbation of ischemia-induced cognitive impairment and WMLs by diet-induced obesity, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered neuroinflammation via toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. MethodsWild-type (WT) and TLR4-knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or low-fat diet (LFD), and subjected to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). Diet groups were compared for changes in gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, WML severity, and cognitive dysfunction. ResultsIn WT mice, HFD induced obesity and increased cognitive impairment and WML severity compared with LFD-fed mice following BCAS. HFD caused gut dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability, and plasma LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Furthermore, HFD-fed mice had higher LPS levels and higher neuroinflammatory status, including increased TLR4 expression, in WMLs. In TLR4-KO mice, HFD also caused obesity and gut dysbiosis but did not increase cognitive impairment or WML severity after BCAS. No difference was found between HFD- and LFD-fed KO mice for LPS levels or inflammatory status in either plasma or WMLs. ConclusionInflammation triggered by LPS-TLR4 signaling may mediate obesity-associated exacerbation of cognitive impairment and WMLs from brain ischemia.

However, the association between its strain behavior and topology has not yet been exhaustively studied computationally. We perform molecular dynamic simulations on both ZIF-8 and its topological silicate isomer sodalite (SOD) to investigate the pressure-induced development of the mid- and short-range structures. We find that both ZIF-8 and SOD undergo two successive transformations. The first is the amorphization process, which is characterized by the breakdown of the mid-range structure without a significant change in the elastic modulus. The other type of densification involves a change in the short-range structure, during which the mechanical properties are improved as the short-range disorder increases.

The clinical course of patients with pancreatic cancer in relation to these driver alterations has not been fully characterised in large populations. We hypothesised that pancreatic carcinomas with different combinations of KRAS mutation and aberrant expression of CDKN2A, p53, and SMAD4 might show distinctive recurrence patterns and post-operative survival outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we utilised a multi-institutional cohort of 1,146 resected pancreatic carcinomas and assessed KRAS mutations by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and CDKN2A, p53, and SMAD4 expression by immunohistochemistry. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed according to each molecular alteration and the number of altered genes using the Cox regression models. Multivariable competing risks regression analyses were conducted to assess the associations of the number of altered genes with specific patterns of recurrence. Loss of SMAD4 expression was associated with short DFS (multivariable HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09-1.43) and OS times (multivariable HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.46). Compared to cases with 0-2 altered genes, cases with three and four altered genes had multivariable HRs for OS of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09-1.51) and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.22-1.78), respectively (p(trend) < 0.001). Patients with an increasing number of altered genes were more likely to have short DFS time (p(trend) = 0.003) and to develop liver metastasis (p(trend) = 0.006) rather than recurrence at local or other distant sites. In conclusion, loss of SMAD4 expression and an increasing number of altered genes were associated with unfavourable outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. This study suggests that the accumulation of the four major driver alterations can confer a high metastatic potential to the liver, thereby impairing post-operative survival among patients with pancreatic cancer.

However, it is unclear which attributes matter the most to newly graduated nurses. The study aimed to identify the relative importance of workplace preference attributes among newly graduated nurses. DesignA cross-sectional study. MethodsWe conducted an online survey and data were collected in June 2022. A total of 1111 newly graduated nurses in South Korea participated. The study employed best-worst scaling to quantify the relative importance of nine workplace preferences and also included questions about participants' willingness to pay for each workplace preferences. The relationships between the relative importance of the workplace attribute and the willingness to pay were determined using a quadrant analysis. ResultsThe order according to the relative importance of workplace preferences is as follows: salary, working conditions, organizational climate, welfare program, hospital location, hospital level, hospital reputation, professional development, and the chance of promotion. The most important factor, salary, was 16.67 times more important than the least important factor, the chance of promotion, in terms of choosing workplace. In addition, working conditions and organizational climate were recognized as high economic value indicators. ConclusionNewly graduated nurses nominated better salaries, working conditions, and organizational climate as having a more important role in choosing their workplace. Clinical RelevanceThe findings of this study have important implications for institutions and administrators in recruiting and retaining newly graduated nurses.

Achieving recommended levels of physical activity can be challenging during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion sought to promote physical activity during and after pregnancy through the development of health education materials for the Move Your Way campaign. Research was conducted with pregnant and postpartum people to learn what types of messages and materials would encourage physical activity in these populations. MethodsParticipants were recruited from 3 regions of the United States to participate in 90-minute virtual focus groups. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older and either pregnant or 6 weeks to 1 year postpartum. Participants were asked questions about their beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions about physical activity and prompted to provide feedback on health promotion messages and images. Sessions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for key themes. ResultsTwenty-four focus groups were conducted with 48 pregnant participants and 52 postpartum participants. Sixteen sessions were conducted in English and 8 were conducted in Spanish. Most participants had questions about how much physical activity is recommended, and many cited their health care provider as a trusted source of information. Participants responded positively to materials that acknowledged the uniqueness of each pregnant or postpartum experience, referenced gradually increasing physical activity levels, highlighted the benefits of physical activity, focused on safety, addressed common barriers, and displayed realistic representations of physical activity. DiscussionThere is an opportunity to improve messaging about physical activity during and after pregnancy. To better promote physical activity, perinatal health care providers and other health professionals can share information about recommended amounts of physical activity, communicate the benefits, and promote realistic and achievable physical activity messages that address common barriers in these populations.

An equivalent initial defect is used to describe the severity of the weld defect. Fatigue life prediction is achieved based on equivalent fracture parameters and high-stress fatigue life reference points fitted to obtain a P-S-N curve for the entire stress range. Taking the 6082-aluminum alloy T-welded joints as the object, the test data under tensile load P-S-N curve fitting and crack growth simulation were carried out to compare and verify the applicability under constant and equivalent spectral load. This method enables deterministic fatigue life prediction with less testing and cost. Meanwhile, the approach incorporates the uncertainty of the physical model of the weld into the P-S-N curve, simplifying the process of calculating the probabilistic fatigue life.

Each group was further divided into RIC and control subgroups. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. The difference in the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome between the RIC subgroup and control subgroup was compared in diabetic and non-diabetic patients, respectively, and the interactions of treatment assignment with diabetes status and FBG were evaluated.ResultsCompared with the control group, RIC produced a significantly higher proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome in the non-diabetic group (70.5% vs. 63.2%; odds ratio [OR] 1.487, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.134-1.949; P = 0.004), while a similar, but not significant difference was observed in the diabetic group (65.3% vs. 59.8%; OR 1.424, 95% CI 0.978-2.073; P = 0.065). Similar results were observed in patients with normal FBG levels (69.3% vs. 63.7%; OR 1.363, 95% CI 1.011-1.836; P = 0.042) and those with high FBG levels (64.2% vs. 58%; OR 1.550, 95% CI 1.070-2.246; P = 0.02). Furthermore, we did not find an interaction effect of intervention (RIC or control) by different diabetes status or FBG levels on clinical outcomes (P > 0.05 for all). However, diabetes (OR 0.741, 95% CI 0.585-0.938; P = 0.013) and high FBG (OR 0.715, 95% CI 0.553-0.925; P = 0.011) were independently associated with functional outcomes in patients overall.ConclusionDiabetes and FBG levels did not influence the neuroprotective effect of RIC in acute moderate ischaemic stroke, although diabetes and high FBG levels were independently associated with functional outcomes.

We first consider PMC surfaces in a non-flat complex space form and prove that they are biconservative if and only if totally real. Then, we find a Simons-type formula for a well-chosen vector field constructed from the mean curvature vector field and use it to prove a rigidity result for CMC biconservative surfaces in two-dimensional complex space forms. We prove then a reduction codimension result for PMC biconservative surfaces in non-flat complex space forms. We conclude by constructing examples of CMC non-PMC biconservative submanifolds from the Segre embedding and discuss when they are proper-biharmonic.

This value belongs to the class of Procedural values due to Malawski. Our value is identical with the Shapley value on one extreme and the Equal Division rule on the other extreme. We show that our value is identical with the solidarity value due to Beal et al. of the dual game. However, by duality, our characterization intuitively improves over the axiomatization of this solidarity value. We also provide a mechanism that implements our value in sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium. Finally, a generalized version of this value is proposed followed by its characterizations.

J	Carlsson, Y; Bergman, S; Nilsdotter, A; Liljedahl, M				Carlsson, Yvonne; Bergman, Stefan; Nilsdotter, Anna; Liljedahl, Matilda			The medical internship as a meaningful transition: A phenomenographic study	MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access							EXPERIENCES; DOCTORS; BURNOUT	BackgroundThe transition from student to doctor is often depicted as a struggle in the literature, and previous research has focused on interventions to minimise difficulties in transitioning from undergraduate to postgraduate training. In considering this transition as a potential transformative experience, we intend to produce new insights into how junior doctors experience the transition to clinical work. The aim of this study was to explore medical interns' conceptualisations of the transition from student to doctor through studying the Swedish medical internship, which serves as a bridge between undergraduate and postgraduate studies. The research question was formulated as follows: How do medical interns perceive the meaning of the medical internship? MethodsThe data were collected through in-depth interviews with 12 senior medical interns in western Sweden. The transcribed interviews were analysed using a phenomenographic approach, which resulted in four qualitatively varying ways of perceiving the meaning of the internship, organised hierarchically in a phenomenographic outcome space. ResultsThe interns perceived the meaning of the internship as an opportunity to work and learn in an authentic setting (internship as in-service training) and in a protected environment (internship as a space). The internship guaranteed a minimum level of competence (internship as a quality marker) and allowed the interns to gain new insights into themselves and their world (internship as an eye-opener). DiscussionBeing allowed to be learners in a protected space seemed pivotal for the interns to develop into competent, confident and independent practitioners. The medical internship studied here could be viewed as a meaningful transition into new ways of experiencing, allowing for an increased understanding of oneself and the world. This study adds to the scientific literature on what constitutes a transformative transition.

DesignSystematic review. Data sourcesSix electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, OVID Nursing, APA PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL) were searched from inception to May 2022. Review methodsOnly randomised controlled trials that examined the effect of decision aids for information provision centring genetic testing on outcomes including decisional conflicts, informed choice making, knowledge on genetic risks or genetic tests, and psychological outcomes among participants who had undergone genetic counselling were included. Their risk of bias was assessed using the Version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. Results were presented narratively. The review was conducted according to the PRISMA checklist. ResultsEight included studies examined the effect of booklet-based, computer-based, film-based or web-based decision aids on individuals considering genetic testing for their increased cancer risks. Despite contrasting findings across studies, they showed that decision aids enable genetic counsellees to feel more informed in decision-making on genetic tests, although most showed no effect on decisional conflict. Knowledge of genetic counsellees on genetic risks and genetic tests were increased after the use of decision aids. Most studies showed no significant effect on any psychological outcomes assessed. ConclusionsReview findings corroborate the use of decision aids to enhance the effective delivery of genetic counselling, enabling genetic counsellees to gain more knowledge of genetic tests and feel more informed in making decisions to have these tests. Relevance to clinical practiceDecision aids can be used to support nurse-led genetic counselling for better knowledge acquisition and decision-making among counsellees.

J	Dür, A; Huber, RA; Stiller, Y				Duer, Andreas; Huber, Robert A.; Stiller, Yannick			Trade Competitiveness, Constituency Interests, and Legislators' Attitudes Towards Trade Agreements	LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY			English	Article; Early Access							INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; CONGRESSIONAL VOTES; IMPORT COMPETITION; POLICY; POLITICS; US; FIRMS; REPRESENTATION; GLOBALIZATION; INSTITUTIONS	We argue that legislators' trade attitudes reflect constituents' economic interests. Concretely, we expect that legislators from districts that are highly competitive in international trade should be more supportive of trade agreements than legislators from noncompetitive districts. The strength of this relationship should be lower in multimember districts and for right-wing legislators. Data based on surveys with 3,576 legislators from 16 Latin American countries and 48 legislative periods between 2005 and 2019 allow us to test these expectations. The surveys captured legislators' attitudes towards trade agreements between their countries and the United States and the European Union, respectively, and the Pacific Alliance. We measure districts' trade competitiveness with an innovative combination of household survey and trade data. The evidence supports all three expectations. The findings contribute to research on trade policymaking, public opinion towards trade, and legislator behavior.

J	Fisher, M				Fisher, Matthew			Multi-sectoral action to promote psychological wellbeing: Theorising the role of place-based policy	HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Review						health in all policies; mental health promotion; multi-sectoral policy; place-based policy; theory of change; wellbeing	HEALTH; STRESS; DISORDERS	Issues AddressedSeveral national governments are showing interest in policies to promote wellbeing. One common strategy is to devise systems to measure indictors of wellbeing, presuming that governments act on what they measure. This article will argue instead that formation of multisectoral policies to promote psychological wellbeing requires a different kind of theoretical and evidentiary basis. MethodsThe article integrates ideas from literature on wellbeing, health in all policies, political science, mental health promotion, and social determinants of health to make a case for place-based policy as the central feature of multi-sectoral policy for psychological wellbeing. Results and DiscussionI argue that the required theoretical foundation for policy action on psychological wellbeing lies with understanding certain basic functions of human social psychology including the role of stress arousal. I then draw on policy theory to propose three steps to translate this theoretical understanding of psychological wellbeing into practicable, multi-sectoral policies. Step one is concerned with adopting a thoroughly revised conception of psychological wellbeing as a policy problem. Step two involves uptake of a theory of change in policy, grounded on recognition of essential social conditions required to promote psychological wellbeing. Proceeding from these, I will argue that a necessary (but not sufficient) third step is to implement place-based strategies involving government-community partnerships, to generate essential conditions for psychological wellbeing on a universal basis. Finally, I examine implications of the proposed approach for current theory and practice in mental health promotion policy. ConclusionsPlace-based policy is foundational for effective multi-sectoral policy to promote psychological wellbeing. So What?Governments aiming to promote psychological wellbeing should position place-based policy at the centre of their strategies.

MethodsThis was a scoping review and followed the PRISMA Scoping Review guideline. MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane library databases were searched for studies published between 2010 and 2020. Studies reporting healthcare interventions in Europe for PwD over 65 years and their family caregivers were included. ResultsTwenty-one studies from six European countries were included. The types of healthcare intervention identified were categorized as follows: (1) family unit intervention (interventions for both PwD and their family caregiver), (2) individual intervention (separate interventions for PwD or family caregivers) and (3) family caregiver only intervention (interventions for family caregivers only but with outcomes for both PwD and family caregivers). ConclusionsThis review provides insight into healthcare interventions for older PwD and family caregivers in Europe. More studies are needed that focus on the family as a unit of care in dementia.

J	Gottardello, D				Gottardello, Debora			The maze: Reflections on navigating intersectional identities in the workplace	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article; Early Access						arts-based research; disability; discrimination; feminism; immigration; intersectionality; metaphor; motherhood; neurodiversity; storytelling; writing differently	PERFORMATIVITY; GENDER; METAPHORS; FICTION; SENSE; WORK; RACE	Myriam's story is the story of a woman who has faced several intersectional barriers throughout her life and career journey, leading her into a "maze" of dead-ends that has jointly prevented her motion. The telling of this story breaks the conventional masculine patterns of academic writing of recent years and represents a turning point in organizational thought. This piece contributes to the growing body of literature in organizational studies on "writing differently," which advocates for alternative modes of writing and doing research, particularly feminist writing that incorporates storytelling, composite character, and arts-based research. The approach taken is informed by the use of metaphor, which provides an additional means to convey nuanced understandings and insights that may not be easily expressed through conventional academic writing. The account illuminates the way social identities operate in tandem with power dynamics, social and national context, patriarchy, and relationality to shape individuals' experiences of oppression and privilege. The discourse emphasizes how these factors interrelate and reinforce one another, giving rise to multiple forms of inequality that have significant impacts on women's professional experiences and careers. It uses inventiveness and creativity to provide an immediate emotional and embodied connection between the reader and the lived experiences of Myriam. By offering an in-depth written and visual representation that moves beyond "linguistic imperialism," this paper intends to create a critically reflexive and inclusive space that makes the invisible embedded and insidious experience of oppression visible to a wider and more diverse audience.

This study aimed to investigate axonal membrane properties during the IVIg treatment cycle and their potential correlation with clinically relevant functional measurements. MethodsMotor nerve excitability testing (NET) of the median nerve was performed before and 4 and 18 days after initiation of an IVIg treatment cycle in 13 treatment-naive (early) CIDP patients and 24 CIDP patients with long term (late) IVIg treatment, 12 CIDP patients treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) and 55 healthy controls. Clinical function was measured extensively using the Six Spot Step test, 10-Meter Walk test, 9-Hole Peg test, grip strength, MRC sum score, Overall Neuropathy Limitations Score and Patient Global Impression of Change. ResultsSuperexcitability and S2 accommodation decreased significantly in the early treatment group from baseline to day 4 and returned to baseline levels at day 18, suggesting temporary depolarization of the axonal membrane. A similar trend was observed for the late IVIg group. Substantial clinical improvement was observed in both early and late IVIg groups during the entire treatment cycle. No statistically significant correlation was found between clinical and NET changes. No change was found in NET or clinical function in the SCIg group or controls. InterpretationNET suggested temporary depolarization of the axonal membrane during IVIg treatment in treatment naive CIDP patients. The relation to clinical improvement, however, remains speculative.

Notably, adult mammals cannot regenerate their hearts after damage such as acute myocardial infarction. In contrast, some vertebrate animals can regenerate the heart throughout their lives. Cross-species comparative studies are important to understand the full picture of cardiac regeneration in vertebrates. Among the animal species able to regenerate the heart, some urodele amphibians, such as newts, possess a remarkable capacity for this process. Standardized methods of inducing cardiac regeneration in the newt are needed as a platform for studies comparing newts and other animal models. The procedures presented here describe amputation and cryo-injury techniques for the induction of cardiac regeneration in Pleurodeles waltl, an emerging model newt species. Both procedures consist of simplified steps that require no special equipment. We additionally show some examples of the regenerative process obtained using these procedures. This protocol has been developed for P. waltl. However, these methods are also expected to be applicable to other newt and salamander species, facilitating comparative research with other model animals.

Prior studies have demonstrated inconsistent results.Objectives: This study evaluated the association between PME and neuropsychologi- cal test scores in late childhood and early adulthood, accounting for a wide range of parental characteristics.Methods: This study evaluated participants from the Raine Study, a cohort of 2868 children born between 1989 and 1992. Children whose mothers provided informa- tion on marijuana use during pregnancy were included. The primary outcome was the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) at age 10. Secondary outcomes included the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND), Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM), Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) and Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores. Exposed and unexposed children were matched by propensity score using optimal full matching. Missing covariate data were imputed using multiple imputation. Inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) was used to adjust for missing outcome data. Linear regression within matched sets, adjusted by IPCW, eval- uated score differences between exposed and unexposed children. As a secondary analysis, modified Poisson regression, adjusted by match weights and IPCW, evalu- ated the risk of clinical deficit in each outcome following PME.Results: Of the 2804 children in this cohort, 285 (10.2%) had PME. After optimal full matching and IPCW, exposed children scored similarly on CELF Total (-0.33 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.71, 4.05), Receptive (+0.65 points, 95% CI -4.08, 5.38) or Expressive (-0.53 points, 95% CI -5.07, 4.02). PME was not associated with secondary outcomes or risks of clinical deficit in any neuropsychological assessments.Conclusions: After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical covariates, PME was not associated with worse neuropsychological test scores at age 10 or autistic traits at 19- 20.

Surprisingly, it has been addressed inadequately and in an isolated manner. In this study, we have developed a cost-effective non-lithographic method for the fabrication of a PDMS-based microchannel-coupled-millreactor. Immobilized nickel particles are resistant to leaching in the flow process. During continuous operation, millireactors show a strong catalytic activity for reduction of resazurin and p-nitrophenol with a conversion rate of almost 100 %. Catalytic poisoning is ubiquitous and gets gradually prominent whereas complete catalytic deactivation of magnetic Ni-microparticles is found to be an instantaneous process. Relatively large-sized resorufin binds predominantly to the surface and thereby blocks the access of the substrate to the Ni-particles. The dissociations of product molecules - resorufin and p-aminophenol are the rate-limiting steps that caused the abrupt deactivation of Ni-microparticle. The kinetic mechanism of heterogeneous derived from the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism satisfactorily explains the catalytic poisoning and deactivation of nickel microparticles. This study sheds light on the intricacies of catalytic activity and poisoning of magnetic nickel microparticles.

Background: Parenting in families of very preterm infants is an interesting focus of research as we advance in the knowledge of how parental competences can have an important impact on child development. Method: Sixty-eight mothers and 56 fathers completed measures of parental competences, socio-family risk, parental stress, social support, and emotional symptoms. Clinical characteristics and neonatal medical risk data were collected after birth. Statistical analyses were performed to compare parental competences with those of mothers and fathers of non-preterm infants. Generalized estimating equations were used for analysis, adjusted by family unit. Results: Mothers and fathers of preterm infants score higher in most dimensions of parental competences compared to a control group. Focusing on the preterm population, mothers score higher than fathers in daily involvement and mentalization and lower in parental self-care. When studied separately, we found different scores for fathers and mothers in parental competences (sociofamily risk, parental stress, social support, and emotional symptoms). Conclusion: Parents of preterm infants present better parental competences than parents of non-preterm infants when their children reach 18 months of age. It is important to consider the differences in parental competences between the mothers and fathers of these children. Implications: Our findings suggest the need to address parental competences to develop preventive and adaptive strategies in parents of preterm infants to promote positive parenting.

J	Krupa, JJ; Slabach, BL				Krupa, J. J.; Slabach, B. L.			Do African egg-eating snakes (<i>Dasypeltis</i>) exhibit preference for eggs they eat?	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Dasypeltis; African egg-eating snakes; feeding preference; obligate egg-eating	PREDATION; SEABIRDS	African egg-eating snakes (genus Dasypeltis) are medium-sized obligate egg-eating species capable of swallowing large eggs compared to facultative egg-eating snakes of the same size. Dasypeltis have numerous adaptations for swallowing then crushing eggs to extract the content. Being dependent on an egg diet, it could be predicted that Dasypeltis have the ability to assess the quality of an egg then decide whether to reject or swallow it. For example, a small egg provides less food and takes less time to swallow than a large egg but swallowing a large egg could leave the snake more vulnerable to predation. Despite the possibility of Dasypeltis exhibiting egg preference, little research has addressed this. This study examined egg preference by five species of Dasypeltis in two laboratory experiments. In the first, five species of snakes were given a choice of the widest size range of eggs available from one order of birds. These included nine species of gallinaceous birds ranging from small, soft-shelled king quail eggs to large, hard-shelled turkey eggs. In the second experiment, snakes were given a choice of four eggs representing three genera of birds that occur in Africa represented by two galliform and two columbiform species. These eggs varied in volume, color, and hardness of shell. The results show Dasypeltis preferred certain eggs. Large snakes eat eggs of all sizes with preference for the largest, hardest eggs, while the smallest snakes ate only the smallest eggs. Snakes preferred columbiform eggs (dove and pigeon) over galliform eggs (king quail and Japanese quail). This study demonstrated that Dasypeltis in captivity do exhibit preferences for types and sizes of eggs.	[Krupa, J. J.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY USA; [Slabach, B.

Affinity peptides, as a miniature biological recognition element, can quickly and effectively detect anthrax protective antigens. Based on computer-aided design technology (CAD), we have herein developed an affinity peptide design strategy for the detection of anthrax protective antigens. Firstly, six high-value mutation sites were determined based on the molecular docking between the template peptide and the receptor, and then the multi-site mutation of amino acids was carried out in order to establish a virtual peptide library. The library was selected by using molecular dynamics simulation and the best designed affinity peptide (code: P24) was found. The theoretical affinity with P24 peptide has increased by 19.8% compared with template peptide. Finally, the affinity with P24 peptide was measured by SPR technology to reach the nanomole level, which verified the effectiveness of the design strategy. The newly designed affinity peptide is expected to be used in the diagnosis of anthracnose.

The vaping appeal is enhanced by the sensory perception of flavours. Thus, an important attention may be paid to the choice of the refill liquid. For this purpose, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of 1,3-propanediol (PDO, vegetal solvent) and 1,3-butanediol (BDO, vegetal solvent), in replacing the chemical one such 1,2-propanediol (PG) while maintaining sensory pleasure and ensuring the wellbeing. The work was conducted with 30 participants accustomed to vaping. Three flavours have been selected, menthol, vanillin and pyrazine, respectively, to provide the most preferred perceptions which are respectively mint, sweet and tobacco. The Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) method was chosen since it is rapid and robust. Menthol/PDO and menthol/PG exhibited a close olfactive profile, described as minty, cold and sweet. A similar finding has been observed for vanillin/PDO and vanillin/PG. The use of BDO provided different perceptions in comparison with PDO and PG regardless of the type of flavour. It was found to be the most suitable for pyrazine perception. These results were enhanced by the application of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The obtained dendrogram was composed of three groups according to their similarities, where e-liquids containing PDO, and PG belongs to the same groups for both menthol and vanillin.

Here we demonstrate that gut microbiota proliferating in response to HearNPV infection promote larval immune responses which impede the infection process. RESULTSThe microbial load of the larval midgut increased following HearNPV infection, due primarily to increases in Enterococcus spp., whereas most other bacterial genera declined, with Firmicutes replacing Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum. Injection of abdominal prolegs of infected larvae with H2O2 promoted viral infection, diminished microbial abundance, and accelerated larval death, mimicking the effects of HearNPV infection, which up-regulated dual oxidase (Duox) expression, increasing H2O2 levels in the midgut. Knockdown of Duox with RNAi reduced H2O2 production in the guts of infected larvae, increased bacterial loads, decreased viral replication, and improved larval survival. Germ-free larvae were more susceptible to HearNPV than control larvae, exhibiting greater expression of Duox, higher levels of H2O2, and lower survival. Replenishment of gut bacteria in germ-free larvae restored the base-line immunity to HearNPV observed in normal larvae. Enterococcus spp., Levilactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus sp. bacteria were isolated and implicated in immunity restoration via replenishment in germ-free larvae. CONCLUSIONThese findings illuminate how gut microbiota play important roles in larval defense against oral baculovirus infection, and suggest novel avenues of investigation to enhance the efficacy of baculoviruses and improve control of lepidopteran pests.

Using a broad international sample with firms from 47 countries?and through multilevel and panel data analysis?results show a positive and significant influence of CSP on CFP, while country sustainability negatively moderates the CSP-CFP relationship. This is consistent with the idea that in countries with a high level of sustainability, firms have greater difficulty obtaining competitive advantages through actions related to corporate social responsibility. Results also indicate that country sustainability has a direct and positive impact on CFP (Tobin's-Q), regardless of CSP. Additionally, applying country sustainability in a disaggregated manner, we find that social and governance dimensions influence the CSP-CFP relationship, while the environmental dimension does not. Evidence thus confirms that the effect of CSP on CFP varies depending on the institutional context in which the firm is located.

Structure characterizations coupled with density functional theory calculations reveal that highly electronegative Mo atoms on NiS2-MoS2 catalyst can capture more e(g) electrons from Ni atoms, and induce lower e(g) occupancy enabling moderate adsorption strength toward oxygenated intermediates. It is evident that hierarchical NiS2-MoS2 nanostructure with fancy built-in electric fields significantly boosted formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during cycling, which contributed to large specific capacities of 16528/16471 mAh g(-1) with 99.65% coulombic efficiency and excellent cycling stability of 450 cycles at 1000 mA g(-1). This innovative heterostructure construction provides a reliable strategy to rationally design transition metal sulfides by optimizing e(g) orbital occupancy and modulating adsorption toward oxygenated intermediates for efficient rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.

The aim of this article is to investigate the dynamic performance of an advanced multifunctional textile under solar radiation. The influence of the fabric properties of the double-layer structure and the optical property of the photothermal nanocomposite based-porous membrane (polyacrylonitrile PAN/carbon nanotube CNT) on the evaporation performance were experimentally and numerically discussed. Initially, a dedicated experimental study was conducted to measure the actual evaporation performance of the functional fabric. Following this, a two-dimensional multi-fluid model, simulated using COMSOL software, is applicable to predict experimental evaporation rates with a reasonable accuracy of 90%. The results showed that the dense structure had a greater wicking-flow rate of 0.5 cm(2) s(-1) but lower evaporation performance in contrast to the permeable fabric. The incorporation of the photothermal nanofibers into the double-layer fabric structure enhanced the surface-localized heating capacity. Through the evaporation process, compared to conventional fabric, the advanced fabric structure exhibited approximately 3.5-4.4? higher outer surface temperature. We concluded that the proposed multi-layer structure has excellent potential to enhance the solar absorption efficiency in the visible range by 50% on average. Besides, the improved evaporation performance of the functional structure was 48% and 55%, respectively, under 0.6 and 1.0 sun illumination. In addition to the clothing field, this study can be extended for wide-reaching applications based on solar vapor generation systems.

This report describes our experience with the intraoperative use of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) for selecting recipient vessels in lower extremity free flap reconstruction cases. Three patients with lower extremity defects and ischemic vasculopathy underwent free flap reconstruction. Intraoperatively, the candidate vessels were evaluated using ICGA. In the first case, a 10 x 6 cm defect on the anterior side of the lower third of the leg caused by minor trauma and associated with peripheral arterial occlusive disease was reconstructed using a super-thin anterolateral thigh flap based on one perforator. In the second case, a 12 x 8 cm defect on the posterior side of the right lower leg caused by a dog bite and associated with severe atherosclerosis throughout all three major vessels in the lower leg was reconstructed using a muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. In the third case, a 13.5 x 5.5 cm defect on the right lateral malleolar region, where the peroneus longus tendon was exposed due to Buerger's disease, was reconstructed using a one perforator-based super-thin anterolateral thigh flap. In all cases, ICGA was used to evaluate the functionality of the candidate recipient vessels. In two cases, the candidate vessels showed acceptable blood flow, and the operations proceeded as planned. In the third case, the planned vessels of posterior tibial vessels were not identified to have sufficient blood flow, and one of their branches showing enhancement in ICGA was selected and used as a recipient vessel. All flaps survived completely. No adverse events occurred during the follow-up period of postoperative 3 months. Our results suggest that ICGA may be a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating the quality of candidate recipient vessels in cases where their functionality cannot be guaranteed with conventional imaging modalities.

E-g increases with decreasing nanoparticles size and is shape-dependent. The competition between Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions is demonstrated. Moreover, E-g decreases with increasing Ge and Si doping concentration or increases by Mn, Cr, and Ni ion doping due to different radii of the doping and the host Fe ions, leading to varying strains. The substitution for Na ion by K or Li(Cu) ions can cause both enhancing or reducing of E-g. Thus, the band gap energy can be regulated by nanoparticles size, ion doping, electron-phonon, and Coulomb interactions.

Two different configuration of hybrid composite that is, woven and chopped fiber reinforced composite are considered for the study. The chopped fiber configuration of the composite is further divided into two types based on fiber length and wt%. The fiber lengths studied are 6 and 12 mm while the wt% studied are 0, 6, and 12 wt%. Woven fiber reinforced composite is divided into five configurations based on wt% of G. optiva fiber with 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 wt%. In all configurations, maximum fiber content of 12 wt% is maintained. B6/GO6 composite exhibits minimum specific wear rate and maximum hardness among all the compositions. Wear experimental results are analyzed by Taguchi optimization technique and based on the five levels and four control factors (sliding velocity, fiber loading, sliding distance, and normal load) L-25 partial orthogonal array was suggested for the woven fiber reinforced composites. Fiber content is the main control parameter for hardness testing and L-9 orthogonal array was suggested according to four control factors and three levels.

J	Blomenhofer, AT; Casarotti, A; Michalek, M; Oneto, A				Blomenhofer, Alexander Taveira; Casarotti, Alex; Michalek, Mateusz; Oneto, Alessandro			Identifiability for mixtures of centered Gaussians and sums of powers of quadratics	BULLETIN OF THE LONDON MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access							HILBERT SERIES	We consider the inverse problem for the polynomial map that sends an m-tuple of quadratic forms in n variables to the sum of their dth powers. This map captures the moment problem for mixtures of m centered n-variate Gaussians. In the first nontrivial case d =3, we show that for any n is an element of N, this map is generically one-to-one (up to permutations of q1, ... ,q(m) and third roots of unity) in two ranges: m <= [(GRAPHICS)] + 1 for n < 16 and <= [(GRAPHICS) / [(GRAPHICS)] -[(GRAPHICS)] - 1 for n >= 16, thus proving generic identifiability for mixtures of centered Gaussians from their (exact) moments of degree at most 6. The first result is obtained by the explicit geometry of the tangential contact locus of the variety of sums of cubes of quadratic forms, as described by Chiantini and Ottaviani [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 33 (2012), no. 3, 1018-1037], while the second result is accomplished using the link between secant nondefectivity with identifiability, proved by Casarotti and Mella [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) (2022)]. The latter approach also generalizes to sums of dth powers of k-forms for d >= 3 and k >= 2.

A closed form solution is derived and the comparison is made with a finite element (FE) implementation that uses the mortar method for enforcing the contact constraints. The test case consists of a semi-infinite cantilever beam subjected to a constant distributed load and experiencing frictionless contact with a straight rigid substrate. Both an Euler-Bernoulli and a Timoshenko beam model are considered and the influence of the differing kinematic hypotheses is analyzed. In the case of the Euler-Bernoulli beam the distributed contact force is equal to the load along the contact region except at the boundary where a point load appears. On the contrary, the rigid substrate exerts a fully distributed load on the Timoshenko beam which decays exponentially from the first contact point and tends towards the applied load. The rate of decay depends on the relative shear deformability. Moreover, whereas in the first case the transverse shear force is discontinuous, it becomes continuous when allowing for shear deformation. An example of benchmarking is given for a particular FE code. The error with respect to the exact solution can be computed and it is shown that the numerical solution converges to the analytic solution when the FE mesh is refined.

Achievement goal profiles and their associations with math achievement, self-efficacy, anxiety and instructional quality: A single and multilevel mixture study	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						achievement goals; goal profiles; instructional quality; latent profile analysis; multilevel mixture models	CLASSROOM CLIMATE; MATHEMATICS CLASSROOMS; PERFORMANCE-APPROACH; STUDENT MOTIVATION; SCHOOL; ORIENTATIONS; KNOWLEDGE; IMPACT	Background: There is growing interest in studying the co-occurrence of multiple achievement goals and how different goal profiles relate to educational outcomes. Further, contextual aspects of the classroom have been known to influence the goals students pursue but existing studies remain confined within certain traditions and confounded by methods not well suited for studying classroom climate effects. Aims: This study sought to investigate achievement goal profiles in mathematics and their associations with background covariates ( i.e., gender, prior achievement) and correlates at the student-level ( i.e., achievement, self-efficacy, anxiety) and class-level (instructional quality dimensions of classroom management, supportive climate, instructional clarity and cognitive activation). Sample: Participants were 3836 Secondary-3 (Grade-9) students from 118 mathematics classes in Singapore. Methods: Achievement goal profiles and their relationships with covariates and student-level correlates were examined with updated procedures of latent profile analysis. Subsequently, multilevel mixture analysis assessed the associations of student-level goal profiles and different class-level dimensions of instructional quality. Results: Four profiles were identified: Average-All, Low-All, High-All and High-Approach. These profiles differed across covariates and correlates, with High-Approach students associated with positive outcomes and High-All students with math anxiety. Cognitive activation and instructional clarity predicted stronger membership in High-Approach profile than Average-All and Low-All, but not High-All. Conclusion: Certain goal profile patterns were consistent with past studies and supported the fundamental separation of approach and avoidance goals. Less differentiating profiles were associated with undesirable educational outcomes. Instructional quality can be considered as an alternative framework for examining classroom climate effects of achievement goals.

Previous studies have shown that the trust of older adults is associated with affect and social cognition. However, little is known about the intrinsic functional connectivity correlated with trust propensity or whether trust propensity is associated with executive functions in older adults. In this study, we examined the association between trust propensity (measured by a one-shot trust game [TG]), social preference (measured by a one-shot dictator game), and executive functions (measured by a battery of neuropsychological tests). We also performed connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and computational lesion analysis to identify the key large-scale resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) underlying the prediction of trust propensity. Our behavioral results showed a lower trust propensity in older adults in our study than in younger adults in a previous meta-analysis. Furthermore, trust propensity was associated with social preference, but there was no significant relationship between trust propensity and executive functions. The neuroimaging results showed that the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and the default mode network (DMN), rather than the frontoparietal network (FPN), significantly contributed to the prediction of trust propensity in older adults. Our findings suggest that older adults rely less on economic rationality (executive functions, associated with FPN) in trust games. Rather, they are likely to depend more on social rationality (social cognition, associated with social preference and DMN) to resolve the risk of treachery (affect, associated with CON) in trust dilemmas. This study contributes to a better understanding of the neural underpinnings of older adults' trust propensity.

We used bivariate analysis and linear regression models to evaluate the relationship between domestic outsourcing, housework evaluations, and marital conflict.Results: Results showed that getting help had significant indirect effects on marital conflict through housework evaluations. However, the two types of help were also positively associated with marital conflicts. The two types of help had simultaneously positive direct effects and negative indirect effects on marital conflicts, canceling out the effect of each other.Implications: Our study illuminates the positive effect of outsourcing through housework evaluation. However, the benefit of domestic outsourcing cannot be realized if the conflicts induced by domestic outsourcing are not resolved.

J	Chung, CY; Joo, S; Kang, S				Chung, Chune Young; Joo, Sunghoon; Kang, Sanggyu			Bond-blockholders and corporate acquisitions	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						agency problem; bank loan contracting; corporate governance; institutional blockholders; mergers and acquisitions	FREE-CASH FLOW; EXECUTIVE-COMPENSATION; LARGE SHAREHOLDERS; AGENCY COSTS; CREATE VALUE; GOVERNANCE; MERGERS; OWNERSHIP; FIRMS; RISK	Research Question/IssueWe examine whether bond-blockholders provide additional, distinct monitoring roles in merger and acquisition (M&A) processes beyond those of equity-blockholders. Using a sample of 4309 M&A deals reported between 2001 and 2010, we shed new light on the monitoring spillover effects of bondholders to shareholders in the context of M&As. Research Findings/InsightsOur findings demonstrate a positive relationship between the presence of bond-blockholders (or a change in their position) and acquiring firms' abnormal return announcements, which supports the monitoring spillover effects from bondholders to shareholders in M&A processes. Our subsample analyses indicate that bond-blockholders are better monitors of (1) overconfident CEOs engaging in M&As, (2) CEOs exhibiting risk-taking behavior in M&As, and (3) entrenched managers participating in M&As. Moreover, we discover a positive association between the previous quarter's changes in "monitoring" bond-blockholders' positions and the acquiring firms' 3-day cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsIn corporate finance literature, equity-blockholders have long been recognized as effective monitors. Despite the importance of debt as most firms' primary funding source, the benefits of debt for monitoring the efficiency of managers and their organizations have been largely overlooked in the existing literature. Thus, this study provides evidence on the additional and distinct monitoring roles of bond-blockholders beyond those of equity-blockholders in M&A processes and the impact of bond-blockholders on shareholders' wealth around M&A announcements. Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsThis study offers insights to policymakers interested in enhancing the legitimacy of corporate governance on the monitoring spillover effects of bondholders to shareholders in the context of M&As. In addition, our findings suggest that bondholders can have a long-term perspective beyond the limited time horizon of bond maturity and influence M&A processes positively. Thus, this study has significant implications for managers and practitioners interested in which investors positively affect M&As.

In the 1970/80ies several groups probed their existence mainly indirectly by trapping experiments or directly by matrix-isolation studies. In 2021, our group and the Severin group reported independently the synthesis and characterization of the first room-temperature stable diazoalkenes, which initiated a rapidly expanding research field. Up to now four different classes of N-heterocyclic substituted room-temperature stable diazoalkenes have been reported. Their properties and unique reactivity, such as N-2/CO exchange or utilization as vinylidene precursors in organic and transition metal chemistry are presented. This review summarizes the early discoveries of diazoalkenes from their initial postulation as transient, elusive species up to the recent findings of the room-temperature stable derivatives.

Materials and Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ezetimibe 10 mg once daily for 16 weeks in individuals with T2D and a UACR of 30 mg/g or higher was conducted. Kidney-PF was assessed with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Geometric mean changes from baseline were derived from linear regressions. Results: A total of 49 participants were randomized to ezetimibe (n = 25) or placebo (n = 24). Overall, mean +/- standard deviation age was 67 +/- 7 years, body mass index was 31 +/- 4 kg/m(2) and the proportion of men was 84%. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 76 +/- 22 mL/min/1.73m(2) and median (first-third quartile) UACR was 95 (41-297) mg/g. Median kidney-PF was 1.0% (0.3%-2.1%). Compared with placebo, ezetimibe did not significantly reduce UACR (mean [95% confidence interval] change: -3% [-28%-31%]) or kidney-PF (mean change: -38% [-66%14%]). In participants with baseline kidney-PF above the median, ezetimibe reduced kidney-PF significantly (mean change: -60% [-84% - -3%]) compared with placebo, while the reduction in UACR was not significant (mean change: -28% [-54%-15%]). Conclusions: Ezetimibe did not reduce the UACR or kidney-PF on top of modern T2D management. However, kidney-PF was reduced with ezetimibe in participants with high baseline kidney-PF.

A decade-long study of repeated prescription burning in California native grassland restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Bromus; invasive annuals; native grasslands; Stipa pulchra	GREAT-PLAINS; PATTERNS; IMPACTS; PLANTS	Native bunchgrass communities dominated by Stipa pulchra are widely distributed in California but share dominance with non-native annual grasses. Restoration of these grasslands focuses on altering the balance of native to non-native grasses to favor the former. This study investigated the impact of burning on vegetation recovery. In the first postfire year burning showed a 70% reduction in cover of non-native annual grasses (Bromus diandrus exhibited the greatest reduction) and minimal impact on S. pulchra recovery. In the following 3 years, S. pulchra recovered to levels comparable to controls, whereas the annual grasses remained below control levels until the fifth year. Also, in response to reduced annual grass cover on burned sites several species of non-native Erodium increased from 10 to 30% relative cover, however, the low growth form of these forbs presented a less competitive threat to bunchgrasses than the non-native annual grasses, and by the third postfire year returned to near control levels. The rare native geophyte Brodiaea kinkiensis was present throughout these grasslands and was not inhibited by burning treatments. To document the reliability of these patterns a second prescription burn was conducted on these sites 5 years after the first burn and vegetation recovery followed for the subsequent 4 years. Patterns observed after the first burn were duplicated following the second burn. The cover of S. pulchra varied in response to precipitation, with the 95% credible intervals of precipitation parameters overlapping zero, however, the cover of non-native grasses varied greatly with precipitation and had similar trajectories in unburned and burned plots.

Early fault detection can boost output with minimum effort. This article combines the application of transfer learning and convolution neural network (TL-CNN) for developing an efficient model for bearing and rotor broken bars damage identification in SCIMs. A simple technique for the 1-D current signal-to-image conversion is also proposed to provide input to the proposed deep learning-based TL-CNN technique. The proposed approach embodies the advantages of TL and CNN for effective fault identification in SCIMs. The developed technique has classified faults efficiently with an average accuracy of 99.40%. The complete analysis and data collection have been done on the experimental set-up with a 5 kW SCIM and LabVIEW-based data acquisition system. The propounded fault detection model has been created in python with the help of packages like Keras and TensorFlow.

In this study, the production of carotenoids from food waste (FW) by a P. rhodozyma mutant was investigated. P. rhodozyma mutant screened by UV mutagenesis and flow cytometry could stably produce high carotenoids at 25 degrees C, with carotenoid production (32.9 mg/L) and content (6.7 mg/g), respectively, increasing by 31.6% and 32.3% compared with 25 mg/L and 5.1 mg/g of wild strain. Interestingly, the carotenoid production reached 192.6 mg/L by feeding wet FW, which was 21% higher than batch culture. The 373 g vacuum freeze-dried products were obtained from the fermentation of 1 kg FW by P. rhodozyma, which contained 784 mg carotenoids and 111 mg astaxanthin. The protein, total amino acids, and essential amino acids content of the fermentation products were 36.6%, 40.5%, and 18.2% (w/w), respectively, and lysine-added fermentation products had the potential of high-quality protein feed source. This study provides insights for the high-throughput screening of mutants, astaxanthin production, and the development of the feed potential of FW.

Specifically, a protonated Bi-based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi-MMTAA-H, MMTAA=2-mercapto-4-methyl-5-thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi-MMTAA-R with the same single-crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of alpha-terpinene to p-cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen-containing Bi-based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.

Among STX analogs so far reported, zetexitoxin AB (ZTX), isolated from the poison dart frog, exhibits the most potent inhibitory activity. ZTX has a macrocyclic lactam structure with a tertiary alcohol at C11. Here, we describe the construction of the characteristic structure of ZTX at C11, focusing on the C-C bond and tertiary hydroxyl group, via two approaches, i. e., Mukaiyama-hydration reaction and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The latter approach also enabled introduction of the nitrogen group at C15. The synthesized compounds functionalized at C11 were further converted to STX-type derivatives, and their Na-V-inhibitory activity was evaluated. STX derivatives with a C11 beta-hydroxyl group exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (EC50=160 +/- 15 nM) than the C11 alpha derivatives.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of the retrotransverse foramen of the atlas	JOURNAL OF ANATOMY			English	Review						anatomic variations; atlas; atlas variations; cervical spine; retrotransverse canal (RTC); retrotransverse foramen (RTF)	VERTEBRAL ARTERY; GROOVE; PLATE; C1	The retrotransverse foramen (RTF) is a nonmetric variant of the atlas vertebra that can accommodate an anastomotic vertebral vein and occipital nerve. An understanding of this variation and its occurrence is crucial, as it could aid in explanation of the unidentified cause of the high prevalence of variability in this region. The aim of this meta-analysis was to obtain data on the prevalence of the RTF and its variations according to anatomy, sex, and ethnicity. A large-scale search was conducted through the major online databases to establish and determine the pool of studies reporting data relevant to the RTF. No date or language restrictions were applied. The data collection was categorized by prevalence, type (incomplete/complete), side, sex, ethnicity, laterality, and diameter. A total of 17 studies (n = 1979 subjects) were incorporated into our analysis. The overall pooled prevalence for a complete RTF was 11.4% and the overall pooled prevalence of an incomplete (partial) RTF was 9.6%. A complete RTF was most prevalent in Africa (Sub-Saharan population) (12.1%), followed by Europe (11.8%) and Asia (9.7%). As this variant occurs in a significant number of patients in all of the aforementioned populations, recognition, and awareness, especially with thorough investigation with computer tomography angiography (CTA) should be implemented, as it is the only possible way to visualize the possible contents of RTF.

Red Blood Cell Transfusions Are Not Associated With Incident Complications or Poor Outcomes in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						complications; infection; intracerebral hemorrhage; outcome; red blood cell transfusion; thromboembolism	VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; APACHE-II; INFECTION; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; GUIDELINES; SEVERITY; ANEMIA; OLDER	BackgroundAnemia is associated with poor intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes, yet the relationship of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to ICH complications and functional outcomes remains unclear. We investigated the impact of RBC transfusion on hospital thromboembolic and infectious complications and outcomes in patients with ICH. Methods and ResultsConsecutive patients with spontaneous ICH enrolled in a single-center, prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2018 were assessed. Primary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions on incident thromboembolic and infectious complications occurring after the transfusion. Secondary analyses assessed relationships of RBC transfusions with mortality and poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for baseline demographics and medical disease severity (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and ICH severity (ICH score).Of 587 patients with ICH analyzed, 88 (15%) received at least one RBC transfusion. Patients receiving RBC transfusions had worse medical and ICH severity. Though patients receiving RBC transfusions had more complications at any point during the hospitalization (64.8% versus 35.9%), we found no association between RBC transfusion and incident complications in our regression models (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42-1.20]). After adjusting for disease severity and other relevant covariates, we found no significant association between RBC transfusion and mortality (aOR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.45-1.66]) or poor discharge modified Rankin Scale score (aOR, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.80-7.61]). ConclusionsIn our cohort with ICH, RBC transfusions were expectedly given to patients with higher medical and ICH severity. Taking disease severity and timing of transfusions into account, RBC transfusion was not associated with incident hospital complications or poor clinical ICH outcomes.

We, therefore, sought to establish a human meniscus ex vivo model to study the meniscal response to cytokine treatment using a proteomics approach. Lateral menisci were obtained from five knee-healthy donors. The meniscal body was cut into vertical slices and further divided into an inner (avascular) and outer region. Explants were either left untreated (controls) or stimulated with cytokines. Medium changes were conducted every 3 days up to Day 21 and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed at all the time points for the identification and quantification of proteins. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used for statistical analysis to estimate the effect of treatments versus control on protein abundance. Treatment by IL1ss increased release of cytokines such as interleukins, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases but a limited catabolic effect in healthy human menisci explants. Further, we observed an increased release of matrix proteins (collagens, integrins, prolargin, tenascin) in response to oncostatin M (OSM) + tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF+interleukin-6 (IL6) + sIL6R treatments, and analysis of semitryptic peptides provided additional evidence of increased catabolic effects in response to these treatments. The induced activation of catabolic processes may play a role in osteoarthritis development.

Although previous reviews confirmed the utility of EBI with participants with developmental disabilities, it is unclear whether certain procedural parameters are associated with positive equivalence outcomes. We extended previous reviews by categorizing studies that used EBI with individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and assessed whether any procedural parameters were associated with better equivalence responding. Due to the wide variability of procedural parameters in EBI research, the best procedural permutations to form equivalence classes with individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are still unknown. Thus, this paper serves as a call to action for applied researchers. Specifically, we encourage and invite researchers to systematically investigate the necessary variables or combination of variables that may lead to successful equivalence class formation.

Using the simple view of reading as a theoretical framework, the intervention focused on students' orthographic knowledge, word reading and listening comprehension to facilitate reading comprehension. MethodA total of 186 Grade 4 CSL students (mean age = 9.22, SD = 0.56) participated in the study and were grouped into the treatment (N = 96) and control (N = 90) groups. A range of Chinese language and literacy skills were assessed before and after the intervention. ResultsThe path analysis showed that the intervention significantly affected orthographic knowledge, word reading and listening comprehension directly and reading comprehension indirectly through the three componential skills after controlling for nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary and autoregressors. ConclusionsThe findings suggest that orthographic knowledge, word reading and listening comprehension may be promising targets for instructing young CSL learners.

Previous studies have shown that MOL has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, insulin-sensitizing effects. However, whether MOL has beneficial effects on PCOS remains to be elucidated. In the current study, 10-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats received letrozole to induce PCOS-like rats, and subsequently were treated with a MOL diet. Then, the body weight and estrus cycles were measured regularly in this period. Finally, the ovarian morphology, blood biochemical indices, anti-oxidative, intestinal flora, and anti-inflammation were observed at the end of the experiment. We found that MOL supplementation markedly decreased the body weight, significantly upregulated the expression of Sirt1, FoxO1, PGC-1 alpha, IGF1, and substantially modulated the sex hormone level and improved insulin resistance, which may be associated with the relieves oxidative stress. Moreover, the supplementation of MOL changed the relative abundance of multiple intestinal flora, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella were decreased, and Blautia and Parabacteroides were increased. These results indicate that MOL is potentially a supplementary medication for the management of PCOS.

The optical properties and the electron transport capacity of the titled dyes are explicated by investigating the geometry, electronic structure, electron injection, and recombination, intramolecular charge transfer, regeneration process, dye aggregation, and light-harvesting. The results manifest that the original 3,3 '-dithioalkyl-2,2 '-bithiophene (SBT)-based molecule behaves better with photovoltaic performance and an enhanced J(SC) and V-OC. For molecular design, the designed dyads not only show the enhanced absorption range and prolonged excited lifetimes but also noticeable electron transfer ability. Moreover, the strong interfacial interaction, fast electron transfer process, long recombination distance, inhibition in dye aggregate, enhanced regenerative interaction energy are elucidated, which is beneficial for a better photocurrent response. However, the slight shift of the conduction band edge in dyads significantly reduces the V-OC, especially for SBT-Chl. Among dyads, SBT-BChl exhibits outstanding photovoltaic performance of 14%. Besides, photocatalysis analysis manifests that the dyad composites behave with red-shifted spectra, enhanced dipole moments, better interfacial interaction to ensure electron transfer, which significantly improved the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. Our study is expected to offer theoretical guidelines for further screening the promising D-p-A-bacteriochlorin dyads in photoelectric functional materials.

In this study, HMT-Co/G-700 catalyst with nanoflower structure and Co, N co-doped carbon encapsulated Co@Co3O4 nanoparticles are synthesized from D-glucose, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and Co(NO3)(2). HMT is presented as the complex to uniformly disperse Co@Co3O4 nanoparticles, dope nitrogen, and create the nanoflower structure. The nanoflower structure enhances high surface area to expose the active sites. The formation of Co3O4 via mild oxidation of Co surface provides oxygen vacancies to adsorb O-2. HMT-Co/G-700 catalyst exhibits excellent ORR electrocatalytic property, i. e. high onset potential (1.03 V), high half-wave potential (0.83 V), low Tafel slope (85.9 mV dec(-1)), and superior OER activity. Especially, the HMT-Co/G-700 catalyst assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery present high-power density (111.0 mW cm(-2)) and long cycle life at 10 mA cm(-2) (576 cycles).

Here, electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, the potential energy surfaces of these systems are explored by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)(3)] complexes (R=Me, Et, Bu, sBu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)(3)]* and [Cu(CF3)(2)]. The former obviously results from an R * loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R * and CF3 * radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas-phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)(2)] increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R*. This finding suggests that the recombination of R * and CF3 * radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)(3)] in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)(3)] complexes (R= aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)(2)] when subjected to collision-induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.

MethodsWe performed a systematic search of PubMed to identify relevant papers published in English or French through December 2019. Different grades of evidence were evaluated. ResultsForty-eight eligible studies. The incidence in preterm infants was high. The lesions were more frequent for preterm infants born under 30 weeks of gestational age and/or below 1500 g. The lesion was most often located on the skin of the nose but could also be found on the intranasal mucous membranes or elsewhere on the face. Nasal injuries appear early after the beginning of non-invasive ventilation at a mean of 2-3 days for cutaneous lesions and eight or nine for intranasal lesions. The most effective strategies to prevent trauma are the use of a hydrocolloid at the beginning of the support ventilation, the preferential use of a mask and the rotation of ventilation interfaces. ConclusionNasal injuries with continuous positive airway pressure treatment in preterm newborn infants were frequent and can induce pain, discomfort and sequelae. The immature skin of preterm newborn infants needs specific attention from trained caregivers and awareness by parents.

This method has significant limitations, however, such as patterning issues and non-uniformity, which hinder their application in integrated circuits as transistors and array pixel displays. To overcome these challenges, various large-scale deposition methods have been developed. In this review, we introduce five major methods for TMDC deposition: chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, pulsed laser deposition, and ink-jet printing. An overview of each method is provided in the following order: surface analysis, electrical characteristics, and limitations of each method are discussed. Furthermore, we present three key strategies for an advanced device fabrication using the discussed deposition methods. By implementing these strategies, we can accelerate the development of highly crystalline and scalable TMDC thin films, which are essential for producing advanced electronic devices with improved performance.

Trends in incidence of ischaemic stroke in people with and without diabetes in Ireland 2005-2015	DIABETIC MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						diabetes mellitus; hospital mortality; incidence; ischaemic stroke; patient discharge	GENDER-DIFFERENCES	Aims: We aim to describe the epidemiology of ischaemic stroke and in-hospital mortality associated with stroke among men and women with and without diabetes from 2005 to 2015. Methods: Secondary data analysis of national hospital discharge data from the Hospital Inpatient Enquiry database. Stroke incidence and in-hospital mortality rates in people with and without diabetes were calculated. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and assess trends over time. Results: The age-adjusted incidence of stroke was twice as high in people with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (men IRR 2.0 [95% CI 1.95-2.06] and women IRR 2.2 [95% CI 2.12-2.27]). The incidence of ischaemic stroke decreased by an average 1.7% per year in men with diabetes and 3.3% per year in women with diabetes. In people without diabetes, the average annual reduction was smaller (0.2% per year in men and 1% per year in women). In-hospital mortality associated with admission with ischaemic stroke was approximately twice as high in those with diabetes compared to those without diabetes among men [IRR 1.81 (1.67-1.97)] and women [IRR 2 (95% CI 1.84-2.18)]. Conclusion: Despite decreases in incidence of ischaemic stroke and associated in-hospital mortality, there remains a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke and mortality in people with diabetes. Therefore, priority must be given to management of risk factors for ischaemic stroke in people with diabetes as well as continued development of targeted stroke prevention strategies.

J	Chen, Z; Chen, ZY; Jin, XL				Chen, Zong; Chen, Zhiyou; Jin, Xiaolei			Mendelian randomization supports causality between overweight status and accelerated aging	AGING CELL			English	Article						facial aging; frailty index; Mendelian randomization; overweight; telomere length	BIOLOGICAL AGE; OBESITY; METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; DYSFUNCTION; HALLMARKS; INSIGHTS; HEALTH; LOCI	It is reported that overweight may lead to accelerated aging. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the causal effect of overweight and aging. We collected genetic variants associated with overweight, age proxy indicators (telomere length, frailty index and facial aging), etc., from genome-wide association studies datasets. Then we performed MR analyses to explore associations between overweight and age proxy indicators. MR analyses were primarily conducted using the inverse variance weighted method, followed by various sensitivity and validation analyses. MR analyses indicated that there were significant associations of overweight on telomere length, frailty index, and facial aging (beta = -0.018, 95% CI = -0.033 to -0.003, p = 0.0162; beta = 0.055, 95% CI = 0.030-0.079, p < 0.0001; beta = 0.029, 95% CI = 0.013-0.046, p = 0.0005 respectively). Overweight also had a significant negative causality with longevity expectancy (90th survival percentile, beta = -0.220, 95% CI = -0.323 to -0.118, p < 0.0001; 99th survival percentile, beta = -0.389, 95% CI = -0.652 to -0.126, p = 0.0038). Moreover, the findings tend to favor causal links between body fat mass/body fat percentage on aging proxy indicators, but not body fat-free mass. This study provides evidence of the causality between overweight and accelerated aging (telomere length decreased, frailty index increased, facial aging increased) and lower longevity expectancy. Accordingly, the potential significance of weight control and treatment of overweight in combating accelerated aging need to be emphasized.

The subsystem dynamic of MRMs is established by joint torque feedback (JTF) technology. An identifier based on fuzzy logic model (FLM) is established to identify unknown system dynamics. Then, the trajectory tracking control issue of MRMs with uncertain disturbance is transformed into a two-player zero-sum differential game. On the basis of event-triggered mechanism and VI algorithm, the event-triggered Hamilton-Jacobi-Issacs (HJI) equation is approximately solved through establishment of actor-critic structure. Different from the traditional adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm, this scheme is based on adaptive fuzzy optimal control through an actor-critic structure, which refers to adaptation of both optimal cost function and optimal control policy. Moreover, tracking errors of closed-loop MRM system are demonstrated to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) under Lyapunov stability theorem. At last, experimental examples and comparisons show the reliability and effectiveness of this method.

Acoustic recording complements camera traps for monitoring sensitive penguin populations	IBIS			English	Article; Early Access						ecoacoustics; Eudyptes chrysocome; passive acoustic monitoring; soundscape ecology; Spheniscus magellanicus; temporal dynamics; Tierra del Fuego	TIERRA-DEL-FUEGO; COLONY ATTENDANCE PATTERNS; SPHENISCUS-MAGELLANICUS; BEAGLE CHANNEL; INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; INTERANNUAL VARIATION; EUDYPTES-CHRYSOCOME; SOUNDSCAPE ECOLOGY; MARTILLO ISLAND; STATEN-ISLAND	In the face of global biodiversity loss that threatens social-ecological sustainability, we must improve our knowledge of species' behaviours, life histories and populations. Enhanced understanding is especially critical for taxa like seabirds that live in remote habitats where monitoring is logistically challenging, and technology-based approaches could lead to major advances. Considering conservation threats and breeding behaviours, penguins represent a promising taxon for further exploration of monitoring methods. Only five of 18 penguin species are currently considered species of Least Concern by the IUCN, and the sensitivity of penguins to ecological disturbances makes them important indicators of ecosystem dynamics. Penguins regularly congregate in dense breeding colonies and are visually and aurally conspicuous animals, making them relatively easy to monitor in some respects. In situ observations and visual remote sensing monitoring methods (i.e. camera traps, uncrewed aerial vehicles and satellite imagery) currently provide highly valuable information on penguin behaviour and population dynamics, but these methods have a number of shortcomings. Several rely on human presence in remote areas, some require clean lines of sight with no visual obstructions, and some offer limited spatial and temporal resolution. In this study we explore the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as a complementary remote sensing method to monitor penguin behaviour and populations at high spatial and temporal resolution without visual constraints or the need for continuous human presence. We conducted observations of vocalization rates and placed automated acoustic recorders in colonies of Magellanic Penguins Spheniscus magellanicus and Southern Rockhopper Penguins Eudyptes chrysocome in conjunction with camera traps. We found positive relationships between acoustic activity and counts of Magellanic Penguins in camera trap photos. We also identified clear diel patterns of acoustic activity that differed between breeding stages, and we found positive correlations between acoustic activity and estimates of colony density for various times of day and radii around recorders. While much work remains to improve this method and refine interpretation, PAM holds great promise as a complementary tool for monitoring the relative abundance and behavioural dynamics of penguins and other colonial animals, particularly those that burrow or nest in dense vegetation that impairs visual monitoring techniques.

This work studies supported nickel catalysts made from hydrotalcites through sol-gel synthesis, Ni-EDTA impregnation, and coprecipitation. The synthetized hydrotalcites present nanocapsular morphology and dispersed nickel nano-oxide particles after calcination at 500 degrees C. The catalysts were evaluated at 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C for 8 hours and demonstrated high conversions and varying yields, with sol-gel oxide catalysts (Sg(OxMix)) showing the best performance with the highest reactivity and controlled coke formation at 800 degrees C after 14 hours of testing. The mixed oxide morphology promotes electronic effects and inhibits carbon encapsulation of metallic particles. Principal component analysis was performed to explain fluctuations in the reaction pathway.

Parental self-efficacy: Longitudinal impact on clinical outcomes across levels of care in adolescent anorexia nervosa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS			English	Article; Early Access						adolescents; anorexia nervosa; eating disorders; hospitalization; inpatient; outpatient; parental self-efficacy; weight gain	FAMILY-BASED TREATMENT; EATING-DISORDERS; GUIDELINES	ObjectiveParental self-efficacy in the domain of weight restoration for adolescents with restrictive eating disorders is central to success in family-based interventions. We sought to characterize this parental self-efficacy during a brief hospitalization for medical stabilization and follow-up among patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) or atypical AN (AAN) enrolled in the StRONG clinical trial to understand the potential impact of inpatient treatment on caregiver empowerment. MethodsPatients were enrolled upon hospital admission and refed per protocol. We examined correlates of the Parents Versus Anorexia (PVA) scale, a measure of parental self-efficacy in the domain of weight restoration, at admission, discharge, 10-days, 1-month, and 3-months post-discharge. Multi-level models evaluated associations among PVA scores and change in %median BMI and Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) global scores over 3-months post-discharge. ResultsParents of N = 67 adolescents and young adults M(SD) age 15.79 (2.20) years and 85.00 (11.86) %median BMI participated. PVA scores did not change significantly during hospitalization (p = .053), which lasted on average 10.7 +/- 4.5 days. PVA scores increased post-discharge (p = .009), with significant increase between discharge and 1-month post-discharge (p = .045). PVA scores were not associated with subsequent clinical outcomes. Rather, a main effect of time significantly predicted higher %median BMI and improved EDE-Q scores (p < .001). DiscussionThe finding that parental self-efficacy did not deteriorate during the inpatient stay is promising given the medical necessity of hospitalization to ensure short-term safety in some cases and the importance of parental self-efficacy to support long-term recovery. Public significanceFamily-based treatment is the recommended treatment for young people with AN and AAN, serious psychiatric illnesses that may require inpatient medical stabilization. Prior evidence suggests that parental self-efficacy in the outpatient setting is a key component of treatment success. The current study suggests that parental self-efficacy and longer-term treatment outcomes are not undermined by a brief inpatient hospitalization.

It depends who you ask: Divergences in staff and external stakeholder narratives about the causes of a healthcare failure	JOURNAL OF CONTINGENCIES AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						corrective culture; healthcare failure; organisational culture; patient perceptions; public inquiry	QUALITY; PERCEPTIONS; CULTURES; PATIENT; TEXT	Investigations of institutional failure in healthcare typically use staff narratives to identify the cultural factors contributing to the incident. But, to what extent can staff, who are embedded in the culture and who were part of the failing, reflect on and report on the culture? We investigate this by comparing 40 witness statements from staff and 53 witness statements from patients and relatives collected by a public inquiry into a major UK healthcare failure (Clostridium difficile outbreak). Through quantitative text analysis, we found that, while staff and external stakeholders both recognised problems in care, they diverged on the factors considered paramount. Staff emphasised underlying factors such as under-resourcing and training (causal culture), while patients and relatives emphasised corrective behaviours such as communication for identifying and taking precautions against the spread of C. difficile (corrective culture). The results indicate that patients and relatives may be able to report on cultural factors that staff do not report or are unaware of, thus allowing a more complete analysis. Even in light of an institutional failure, staff may have incomplete accounts of the contributing cultural factors, with implications for learning and postincident improvement.	[Hald, E.

Distance spectacle-wearing habits in older patients in England	OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS			English	Article						adaptation; ametropia; older people; progressives; pseudophakia; spectacles	MULTIFOCAL INTRAOCULAR LENSES; UNCORRECTED REFRACTIVE ERROR; CATARACT-SURGERY; EXPECTATIONS; PRESBYOPIA; IMPAIRMENT; PEOPLE; TRIAL; FALLS	Purpose: To report the proportion of older people in England who wear distance spectacles full time, part time and rarely, and to investigate factors that influence how much the distance vision (DV) correction is worn. Methods: A two-part questionnaire investigating the spectacle-wearing habits of older people was developed and completed by 322 participants (age 72 years +/- 7.7, range 60-94). A subcohort of 209 DV correction wearers with a mean spherical equivalent (MSE) of <+/- 4.00DS was selected for a logistic regression to investigate which factors influence how much the DV correction is used. Results: In total, 43% of emmetropic, and 55% of pseudophakic, DV spectacle wearers wear their correction full time. Lens type, MSE and the age that participants first wore a DV correction significantly predicted DV correction wearing habit (adjusted R-2 = 0.36), with lens type being the strongest predicting factor and progressive users wearing their spectacles 37% more than those using single vision lenses. Conclusions: Many patients appear to consider convenience more important than being spectacle independent at distance, with lens type the most significant influencing factor of how much those with low/moderate refractive error wear their distance correction. Many emmetropes and pseudophakes choose to wear their progressive or bifocal spectacles full time, and the emmetropia provided by cataract surgery does not provide independence from full-time spectacle wear for many patients. The optometrist has a key role in discussing both choice of spectacle lens correction and the refractive outcome options of cataract surgery with patients.

The aim of this study was to identify novel oncogenes in oral cancer in older nonsmokers. Material and MethodsWhole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 324 oral cancer patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were extracted from the WES data of older patients. Fisher's exact test was performed to determine the specificity of variants in these genes. Finally, SNVs and INDELs were identified by target enrichment sequencing. ResultsGene ontology analysis of 112 genes with significant SNVs or INDELs in nonsmokers revealed that nonsynonymous SNVs in HECTD4 were significantly more frequent in nonsmokers than in smokers by target enrichment sequencing (p = .02). ConclusionsFurther investigation of the function of HECTD4 variants as oncogenes in older nonsmokers is warranted.

This task is very complex, as the behaviour of road agents depends on many factors and the number of possible future trajectories can be considerable (multi-modal). Most prior approaches proposed to address multi-modal motion prediction are based on complex machine learning systems that have limited interpretability. Moreover, the metrics used in current benchmarks do not evaluate all aspects of the problem, such as the diversity and admissibility of the output. The authors aim to advance towards the design of trustworthy motion prediction systems, based on some of the requirements for the design of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The focus is on evaluation criteria, robustness, and interpretability of outputs. First, the evaluation metrics are comprehensively analysed, the main gaps of current benchmarks are identified, and a new holistic evaluation framework is proposed. Then, a method for the assessment of spatial and temporal robustness is introduced by simulating noise in the perception system. To enhance the interpretability of the outputs and generate more balanced results in the proposed evaluation framework, an intent prediction layer that can be attached to multi-modal motion prediction models is proposed. The effectiveness of this approach is assessed through a survey that explores different elements in the visualisation of the multi-modal trajectories and intentions. The proposed approach and findings make a significant contribution to the development of trustworthy motion prediction systems for autonomous vehicles, advancing the field towards greater safety and reliability.

In this study, we approached this question by chronic exposure of AC16 to the non-observable acute effect level (NOAEL) PM2.5 5 mu g/mL and its positive reference 50 mu g/mL, respectively. The doses were respectively defined on the cell viabilities >95% (p = 0.354) and >90% (p = 0.004) when treated acutely (24 h). To mimic the long-term exposure, AC16 was cultured from the 1st to 30th generations and treated with PM2.5 24 h in every three generations. The integration of proteomic and metabolomic analysis was applied, and 212 proteins and 172 metabolites were significantly altered during the experiments. The NOAEL PM2.5 induced both dose- and time-dependent disruption, which showed the dynamic cellular proteomic response and oxidation accumulation, the main metabolomics changes were ribonucleotide, amino acid, and lipid metabolism that have involved in stressed gene expression, and starving for energy metabolism and lipid oxidation. In summary, these pathways interacted with the monotonically increasing oxidative stress and led to the accumulated damage in AC16 and implied that the safe threshold of PM2.5 may be non-existent when a long-term exposure occurred.

However, most of these difluoromethylations proceed under photocatalytic conditions, whereas those requiring thermal conditions are few. Herein, we developed a general and practical method of Cu-catalyzed alkene difluoromethylation with difluoroacetic anhydride (DFAA) as a CF2H source, showing that the thus realized amino-, allylic-, and oxy-difluoromethylations involve bis(difluoroacetyl) peroxide (BDFAP) in situ generated from DFAA and H2O2 and further demonstrating the occurrence of carbo-difluoromethylation under catalyst-free conditions. The obtained results pave the way to the simple and efficient synthesis of a broad range of difluoromethylated species and thus facilitate their practical applications, including those in medicinal and agricultural chemistry. Moreover, we probed the mechanisms of the observed transformations, rationalized the extraordinary fast decomposition of BDFAP compared to that of diacyl peroxides containing CF3 or CF2Cl groups, and performed DFT calculations to shed light on the low stability and decomposition mode of BDFAP. Finally, we examined the influence of fluorinated radical philicity on the reaction outcome.

Here, we examine evidence for a genetic bottleneck in a population of American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) before and after the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV). More than 50% of marked birds in this population were lost over the 2-year period of the epizootic, representing a 10-fold increase in adult mortality. Using analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellite markers, we tested for evidence of a genetic bottleneck and compared levels of inbreeding and immigration in the pre- and post-WNV populations. Counter to expectations, genetic diversity (allelic diversity and the number of new alleles) increased after WNV emergence. This was likely due to increases in immigration, as the estimated membership coefficients were lower in the post-WNV population. Simultaneously, however, the frequency of inbreeding appeared to increase: Mean inbreeding coefficients were higher among SNP markers, and heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlations were stronger among microsatellite markers, in the post-WNV population. These results indicate that loss of genetic diversity at the population level is not an inevitable consequence of a population decline, particularly in the presence of gene flow. The changes observed in post-WNV crows could have very different implications for their response to future pathogen risks, potentially making the population as a whole more resilient to a changing pathogen community, while increasing the frequency of inbred individuals with elevated susceptibility to disease.

The current gold standard method for quantifying sarcopenia is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) but does not measure muscle directly-it is a composite measure quantifying "lean mass" (muscle) excluding fat and bone. In humans, DXA overestimates muscle mass, which has led to erroneous conclusions about the importance of skeletal muscle in human health and disease. In animal models, DXA is a popular method for measuring lean mass. However, instrumentation is expensive and is potentially limited by anesthesia concerns. Recently, the D-3-creatine (D3Cr) dilution method for quantifying muscle mass was developed in humans and rats. This method is faster, cheaper, and more accurate than DXA. Here, we demonstrate that the D3Cr method is a specific assay for muscle mass in mice, and we test associations with DXA and body weight. We evaluated the D3Cr method compared to DXA-determined lean body mass (LBM) in aged mice and reported that DXA consistently overestimates muscle mass with age. Overall, we provide evidence that the D3Cr dilution method directly measures muscle mass in mice. Combined with its ease of use, accessibility, and non-invasive nature, the method may prove to more quickly advance development of preclinical therapies targeting sarcopenia.

MethodsThe 2017-2018 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data were used, and 9960 individuals aged 60 years and above were included in the analyses. Factors evaluated in this survey included sociodemographic characteristics, clinical variables, physical and social activities, and economic and social factors. The associations of low life satisfaction with independent variables were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. ResultsCompared with those with an intimate partner (n = 2025), elders without an intimate partner (n = 7935) showed a higher prevalence of low life satisfaction (15.1 vs. 9.9%, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that >= 2 physical diseases (P = 0.024), poor self-reported health status (P = 0.012), and lack of community care service (P = 0.014) were risk factors for low life satisfaction among elders without an intimate partner, while poor self-reported health status (P < 0.001), >= 2 physical diseases (P = 0.001), being troubled with bodily pain (P < 0.001), lack of light physical activity >10 mins each time (P = 0.011), lack of moderate physical activity >10 mins each time (P = 0.001), lack of social activities in the previous month (P = 0.039), and lack of community care service (P < 0.001) were risk factors for elders with an intimate partner. Regarding the potential reasons for low life satisfaction in the elderly, dissatisfaction with current health status (28.0%) and air quality (15.6%) were most prevalent. ConclusionsOlder people without an intimate partner have lower life satisfaction. Having >= 2 physical diseases, poor self-reported health status, and lack of community care service were common risk factors for low life satisfaction among older adults with or without an intimate partner.

PRISM study-Pre-natal iron deficiency screening and management within an Australian regional centre	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH			English	Article						clinical; management; obstetrics; quality use of medicine; safety and quality		IntroductionCurrent Australian guidelines differ in their recommendations on optimal iron deficiency anaemia screening and management during pregnancy. A more active approach to screening and treatment of iron deficiency in pregnancy has been beneficial within a tertiary population. However, this approach has not been evaluated within a regional healthcare setting. ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical impact of standardised screening and management for iron deficiency in pregnancy within a regional Australian centre. DesignSingle centre, retrospective cohort observational study that audited medical records pre and post implementation of standardised screening and management for antenatal iron deficiency. We compared rates of anaemia at birth, rates of peripartum blood transfusions and rates of peripartum iron infusions. FindingsThere were 2773 participants with 1372 participants in the pre-implementation group and 1401 in the post-implementation group. Participant demographics were similar. Anaemia at admission for birth decreased from 35% to 30% (RR 0.87, 95% CI (0.75, 1.00), p 0.043) Fewer blood transfusions were required (16 (1.2%) pre-implementation, 6 (0.4%) post-implementation, RR 0.40, 95% CI(0.16, 0.99), p 0.048). Antenatal iron infusions increased from 12% to 18% of participants post implementation (RR 1.47, 95% CI(1.22, 1.76), p < 0.001).We audited compliance with the guidelines and found improvements post implementation. DiscussionThis is the first study to show clinically useful and statistically significant reduction in rates of anaemia and blood transfusions, post implementation of routine ferritin screening and management within a regional Australian population. ConclusionThe results of this study suggest there is benefit to implementation of standardised ferritin screening and management packages in Australian antenatal care. It also encourages RANZCOG to review current recommendations on screening for iron deficiency anaemia during pregnancy.

The plant oil-based 1.19-nonadecanedioic acid is synthesized from bio-derived oleic acid via isomerizing methoxycarbonylation. The homopolymer PA 6.19 with a carbon-based bio-content of 72% shows a good elongation at break of 166%, but lower tensile strength than commercial PA 6 (43 MPa versus 82 MPa). Addition of adipic acid to form statistical PA 6.6/6.19 copolymers improves toughness while maintaining the high elongation at break. Two PA 6.6/6.19 copolymers with a carbon-based bio-content of 26% and 33% are successfully synthesized and exhibited comparable toughness (94 +/- 6 MPa and 92 +/- 2 MPa) to the commercial PA 6 (92 +/- 15 MPa). The bio-based copolymers also exhibit a much lower water uptake than PA 6 and PA 6.6, resulting in a higher dimensional stability. Melt spinning of the oleic acid-based polyamides is successfully carried out to produce monofilaments with sufficient properties for further processing in a knitting process, demonstrating the capabilities of the bio-based PA 6.6/6.19 copolymers for use in the textile industry.

Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety outcomes of each intervention. MethodsWe queried PubMed and EMBASE in January 2023 and performed a network meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT), including high or intermediate-risk PE patients, and comparing AC, CDT, SE, and ST. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and major bleeding. The secondary outcomes included long-term mortality (>= 6 months), recurrent PE, minor bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. ResultsWe identified 11 RCTs and 42 observational studies involving 157,454 patients. CDT was associated with lower in-hospital mortality than ST (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.41 [0.31-0.55]), AC (OR [95% CI]: 0.33 [0.20-0.53]), and SE (OR [95% CI]: 0.61 [0.39-0.96]). Recurrent PE in CDT was lower than ST (OR [95% CI]: 0.66 [0.50-0.87]), AC (OR [95% CI]: 0.36 [0.20-0.66]), and trended lower than SE (OR [95% CI]: 0.71 [0.40-1.26]). Notably, ST had higher major bleeding risks than CDT (OR [95% CI]: 1.51 [1.19-1.91]) and AC (OR [95% CI]: 2.21 [1.53-3.19]). By rankogram analysis, CDT presented the highest p-score in in-hospital mortality, long-term mortality, and recurrent PE. ConclusionIn this network meta-analysis of observational studies and RCTs involving patients with intermediate to high-risk PE, CDT was associated with improved mortality outcomes compared to other therapies, without significant additional bleeding risk.

Unlike traditional condiments, the complex flavor of mushrooms is not determined by a single component, but rather by the potential synergistic actions of several different components and chemical interactions. However, only a limited number of edible mushroom flavor compounds have been examined in detail, leading to an incomplete understanding of their overall flavor profile. To address this knowledge gap, it is necessary to conduct further scientific research on edible mushroom flavors to maximize their utilization. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the flavor substances found in edible mushrooms, including both volatile and nonvolatile compounds, as well as the mechanisms by which various processing methods affect flavor. Additionally, we will explore the various factors that hinder the development of edible mushroom flavors and recommend strategies to further advance the technological and theoretical understanding of these unique and valuable food ingredients. In summary, by enhancing our understanding of the complex and unique flavor profile of edible mushrooms, we can better leverage their full potential as a valuable culinary and medicinal resource.

Here, a novel fluorinated covalent-organic polymer was prepared by using 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorotelephtal aldehyde as the precursors and introduced as stationary phase for open-tubular capillary electrochromatography. The as-synthesized fluorinated covalent-organic polymer and the modified capillary column were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Based on strong hydrophobic interaction and fluorine-fluorine interaction provided by fluorinated covalent-organic polymer coating layer, the modified column showed powerful separation selectivity toward hydrophobic compounds, organic fluorides, and fluorinated pesticides. Additionally, the fluorinated covalent-organic polymer with good porosity and regular shape was uniformly and tightly coated on the capillary inner wall. The obtained highest column efficiency could reach up to 1.2 x 10(5) plates center dot m(-1) for fluorophenol. The loading capacity of the modified column can reach 141 pmol for trifluorotoluene. Besides, the relative standard deviations of retention times for intraday run (n = 5), interday run (n = 3), and between columns (n = 3) were all less than 2.55%. Significantly, this novel fluorinated material-based stationary phase shows great application potential in fluorides analysis.

Here, a phase-engineered water-air impedance matching metasurface is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for remote and efficient water-to-air eavesdropping. The judiciously designed metasurface with near-unity transmission efficiency, long monitoring distance, and high mechanical stiffness is capable of making the water-air interface acoustically transparent and, at the same time, freewheelingly patterning the transmitted wavefront. This enables efficient control over the effective spatial location of a distant airborne sensor such that it can measure underwater signals with large signal-to-noise ratios as if placed close to the physical underwater source. Such airborne eavesdropping of underwater sound is experimentally demonstrated with a measured sensitivity enhancement of nearly 10(4) at 8 kHz, far from achievable with the current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the opportunities of using the proposed metasurface for cross-media orbital-angular-momentum-multiplexed communication and underwater acoustic window are also demonstrated. This metasurface opens new avenues for communication and sensing in inhomogeneities with totally reflective interfaces, which may be translated to nano-optics and radio frequencies.

Conventionally, zebrafish are studied during the first few days of development using optical microscopy methods. However, optical methods are not suited for imaging at later stages, since the fish become opaque. To address needs to visualize beyond the first days of development, a novel multimodality system for observing zebrafish from larval stage to adulthood is developed. Using a hybrid platform for concurrent selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) and optoacoustic mesoscopy, fish (ex vivo) at stages of development up to 47 days at a similar object size-to-resolution ratio are imaged. Using multiple wavelength illumination over the visible and short-wavelength infrared regions, it is demonstrated that the optoacoustic method can follow GFP-based contrast used in SPIM, enabling molecular imaging interrogation in adult fish. Moreover, the optoacoustic modality reveals zebrafish features based on optical contrast absent in SPIM, including contrast from endogenous blood, water, and lipids. It is discussed how the hybrid system method can enable the study of zebrafish in a wider range of applications and over time-scales not possible currently when using optical microscopy.

More optimal biomarkers may help improve recurrence and prognosis.Methods: We investigated whether the oncological properties of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) can participate in the prognosis of HCC. We evaluated the NeuGc antigen (Ag) expression in the HCC tissues and measured the preoperative anti-NeuGc IgG antibodies (Abs) in the sera of the patients with HCC. We compared the clinical characteristics and survival rate in the hepatectomized patients (initial; n = 66, recurrent; n = 34) with and without the NeuGc Ag or Abs.Results: Multivariate analyses showed positive expression of NeuGc Ag in HCC tissues (Odds ratio; initial = 6.3, recurrent = 14.0) and higher titers of preoperative anti-NeuGc Ab (Odds ratio; initial = 4.9; recurrent = 3.8), which could be the predictive factors related to early recurrence. Both the NeuGc Ag-positive and Ab-positive groups in the initial hepatectomized patients exhibited significantly shorter recurrent free survival compared to those in the negative groups.Conclusions: Our findings suggested that anti-NeuGc Ab titers and NeuGc Ag expression in the HCC tissues can be used as the predictive factors for the postoperative recurrence and prognosis of HCC.

However this vascular approach is associated with vascular complications (VC) which in turn have prognostic implications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of access site VC in patients undergoing TAVI with newer generation transcatheter prostheses enrolled in the national observational prospective multicenter study OBSERVANT II. MethodsVascular events were defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria. The population enrolled in OBSERVANT II was divided into 3 groups: patients without VC (No-VC), patients with minor VC or percutaneous closure device failure (Minor-VC) and patients with major VC (Major-VC). The primary endpoint was 1-year major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE), a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization. A multivariate Cox regression model was used for risk estimation of MACCE between the three analyzed groups. Results2.504 patients were included in this analysis: 2.167 patients in No-VC group; 249 patients in the Minor-VC and 88 patients in the Major-VC. At 1-year Minor-VC group had a freedom from MACCE comparable to the No-VC group, while Major-VC patients had significantly worse outcome (Log-rank test: p = 0.003). These results were driven by higher 1-year mortality in the Major-VC (p < 0.0001). Major-VC was an independent predictor of MACCE in adjusted analysis (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.18-3.03, p = 0.008). ConclusionsDespite a low incidence of major VC with current TF-TAVI devices, our data confirm that major VC is still associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome.

This functionality can be applied to derive robotic systems that are environmentally friendly. This study presents a fully biodegradable soft actuator, which is one of the key elements in "green" soft robotics. The working of the actuator is based on an electrohydraulic principle, which is similar to that of hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators. The actuator developed in this study consists of a dielectric film made of polylactic acid (PLA) and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), with soybean oil as the dielectric liquid and electrodes made from a mixture of gelatin, glycerol, and sodium chloride (NaCl). The synthesized biodegradable electrode material exhibits a Young's modulus of 0.06 MPa and resistivity of 258 omega center dot m when the mass fraction of NaCl relative to the amount of gelatin and glycerol is 10 wt%. The softness and resistivity of the electrode material results in actuation strain values of 3.2% (at 1 kV, corresponding to 1.2 kV mm(-1)) and 18.6% (at 10 kV, corresponding to 9.6 kV mm(-1)) for the linear-type and circular-type actuators, respectively. These values obtained for the biodegradable electrohydraulic soft actuators are comparable to those of nonbiodegradable actuators of the same type, representing the successful implementation of the concept.

After the initiation of the treatment, she became aware of numbness, dizziness, and loss of appetite. Exploration of the causes revealed no clues, but blood tests revealed hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. She was treated with intravenous calcium and magnesium, which resolved calcium, magnesium levels, and her symptoms. She was diagnosed with hypomagnesemia because of nedaplatin. Regular follow-up is necessary for patients during or after nedaplatin. Awareness of electrolyte disturbances may elucidate the accurate diagnosis even in patients with obscure symptoms, particular in undergoing or following anticancer therapies.

Despite their high potential for constructing condensed pi-conjugated molecules, the synthetic utility of longer cumulenes remains to be established owing to their inherently high reactivity. Conjugated bisbutatrienes having two cumulene moieties linked by a spacer as a mimic of a longer cumulene were evaluated. Here, the synthesis and characterization of hexafluorocyclopentane-bridged bisbutatrienes are described. These bisbutatrienes underwent various cyclizations, to construct the unique pi-extended frameworks inaccessible by other methodologies. The bisbutatrienes were converted into fulvenes, pentalene, germacycle, and benzocyclobutene under various conditions. Furthermore, a cyclooctatetraene derivative was synthesized by a one-step dimerization of the bisbutatriene.

Over the last decades, introductions of new fishing techniques along with globalizing trade have strongly changed local fishing practices.The Parc National du Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) in Mauritania had for centuries been subjected to an artisanal, low-impact, fishery. This fishing was exclusively oriented towards migratory bony fish species, mullet (Mugil cephalus) and meagre (Argyrosomus regius). Since the 1980s, these species have been replaced by illegal catches of internationally traded elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and by non-migratory and relict species (resident) such as tilapias (Sarotherodon melanotheron) and catfishes (Arius sp.).To date, most monitoring and management efforts have been dedicated to evaluating changes in elasmobranch populations and less focus has been on bony fish species. Data from a fishery monitoring programme are used to analyse the trends in effort, catch and catch per unit of effort of bony fish species by fitting non-parametric generalized additive models to capture changes in the fish community over the last 20 years.Mullet and meagre became overfished early on, and the contribution of resident species (tilapias and catfishes) increased in the catches. Together with a pattern of increased effort on the traditionally targeted species, such a change in the catch could reflect a change in the fish community.These results call for the implementation of sustainable fishing practices within PNBA. We propose the need to implement closures of fisheries during the species' breeding periods as well as the use of biological reference points such as the size at first capture and maximum sustainable yield targets for resident species.

This study aimed to investigate obstetric and perinatal outcomes in women with short stature; specifically, to investigate whether short-stature patients are at an increased risk for cesarean delivery. MethodsA population-based cohort study was conducted, including all singletons born between the years 1991 and 2021 at a tertiary medical center. Obstetric and perinatal outcomes of short-stature patients were compared with those of non-short patients. A generalized estimation equation binary logistic model was constructed to adjust for confounders and maternal recurrence in the cohort. ResultsThe study population included 356 356 parturient; among them, 14 035 (3.9%) were short-stature patients. Short-stature patients had significantly higher rates of cesarean delivery (20.7% vs 13.7%, odds ratio = 1.64, 95% confidence interval 1.57-1.71, P < 0.001), induction of labor, pathologic presentations, prolonged second stage of labor, non-reassuring fetal monitoring, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Newborns of short-stature patients had a significantly higher risk of being small for gestational age as compared with those of non-short patients. In the generalized estimation equation models, the association between short stature and risk of cesarean delivery remained significant (adjusted odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.27-1.38, P < 0.001), as well as the risk of small for gestational age newborns (adjusted odds ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.40-1.63, P < 0.001), but not for the other adverse outcomes. ConclusionsMaternal short stature is an independent risk factor for cesarean delivery and is associated with small for gestational age newborns.

The saturated absorption behavior of TiS2 on the YAG substrate is investigated. Then, TiS2 is successfully employed as a modulation element to develop a Tm:YAG ceramic eye-safe pulsed laser. With a 7.04 W absorbed pump light and a 3% transmission of output coupler, the greatest average optical power, and the least pulse width (PD) are 233 mW and 524 ns, separately. The pulse repeated frequency of 69 kHz is generated, while the single pulse energy (SPE) is 3.38 mu J. Based on the experimental results, TiS2 nanosheet films possess the practical value as saturable absorbers for 2.0 mu m eye-safe pulsed lasers.

Confronting the challenge of gender nonconforming donors: A blood center's three-year experience	TRANSFUSION			English	Article						blood donor collections; gender diversity; gender neutral; gender nonconforming		BackgroundBlood center organizations (BCOs) have traditionally offered two gender choices (male or female) on the donor history questionnaire (DHQ). Our BCO was one of the first in the United States to offer additional options on our DHQ to improve the experience for gender nonconforming donors. Study Design and MethodsThree years of data were analyzed from all blood donation visits between March 2019 and March 2022. Donors were stratified by gender categories and generation as follows: Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Boomers, and Silent. First time donor status, donor deferrals and infectious disease rates were evaluated for each category. ResultsDonor gender makeup included 127,072 (99.78%) Male/Female (M/F) and 282 (0.22%) Trans/Other (T/O) donors. The return rate for first-time donors was 36.75% for M/F donors compared to 33.84% for T/O donors. The generational breakdown of our T/O donors is 71.28% Gen Z, 21.99% Millennial, 3.19% Gen X, 3.55% Boomers and none from the Silent Generation. Comparing high risk DHQ deferrals, there were 719 (0.57%) M/F deferrals and 18 (6.38%) T/O deferrals. Disease marker testing resulted in 2314 (0.56%) deferrals of M/F donors compared to 2 (0.41%) T/O deferrals. ConclusionIncreased gender options on the DHQ allowing gender diverse self-identification enhances inclusivity. Transgender and nonbinary individuals accounted for a minority of donors, most of whom are younger, and have a comparable return rate to M/F donors. Shifts in donor policies can ensure inclusivity of this diverse population and provide an opportunity to expand the base of eligible donors.	[Reynolds, Vanessa; Van Buren, Nancy L. L.; Gorlin, Jed B.

However, studies on ES for atherosclerosis (AS) are scarce because ES does not provide a long-term intervention for chronic disease processes. Battery-free implants and surgically mounted them in the abdominal aorta of high-fat-fed Apolipoprotein E (ApoE(-/-)) mice are used, which are electrically stimulated for four weeks using a wireless ES device to observe changes in atherosclerotic plaques. Results showed that there is almost no growth of atherosclerotic plaque at the stimulated site in AopE(-/-) mice after ES. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of Thp-1 macrophages reveal that the transcriptional activity of autophagy-related genes increase substantially after ES. Additionally, ES reduces lipid accumulation in macrophages by restoring ABCA1- and ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Mechanistically, it is demonstrated that ES reduced lipid accumulation through Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1)/Autophagy related 5 (Atg5) pathway-mediated autophagy. Furthermore, ES reverse autophagic dysfunction in macrophages of AopE(-/-) mouse plaques by restoring Sirt1, blunting P62 accumulation, and inhibiting the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, resulting in the alleviation of atherosclerotic lesion formation. Here, a novel approach is shown in which ES can be used as a promising therapeutic strategy for AS treatment through Sirt1/Atg5 pathway-mediated autophagy.

Attitudes toward children: Distinguishing affection and stress	JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY			English	Article; Early Access						attitudes; children; individual differences; intergroup processes; prejudice	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; BABY SCHEMA; INITIAL VALIDATION; SCALE; NEED; MOTIVATION; ADJUSTMENT; BEHAVIORS; PREJUDICE; SYSTEM	Background: Adults' views and behaviors toward children can vary from being supportive to shockingly abusive, and there are significant unanswered questions about the psychological factors underpinning this variability.Objective: The present research examined the content of adults' attitudes toward children to address these questions.Method: Ten studies (N = 4702) identified the factor structure of adults' descriptions of babies, toddlers, and school-age children and examined how the resulting factors related to a range of external variables.Results: Two factors emerged-affection toward children and stress elicited by them-and this factor structure was invariant across the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Africa. Affection uniquely captures emotional approach tendencies, concern for others, and broad positivity in evaluations, experiences, motivations, and donation behavior. Stress relates to emotional instability, emotional avoidance, and concern about disruptions to a self-oriented, structured life. The factors also predict distinct experiences in a challenging situation-home-parenting during COVID-19 lockdown-with affection explaining greater enjoyment and stress explaining greater perceived difficulty. Affection further predicts mentally visualizing children as pleasant and confident, whereas stress predicts mentally visualizing children as less innocent.Conclusions: These findings offer fundamental new insights about social cognitive processes in adults that impact adult-child relationships and children's well-being.

Particularly relevant to this paper, adaptive learning is a critical component of personalized, preclass learning in a flipped classroom. Previously inaccessible, data generated by adaptive learning platforms regarding student engagement with the course content provides an invaluable opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the learning process and improve upon it. We aim to investigate the relationships between adaptive learning platform interactions and overall student success in the course and identify the variables most influential to student success. We present a comprehensive analysis of our adaptive learning platform data collected in a Numerical Methods course, including aggregate statistics, frequency analysis, and Principal Component Analysis, to determine which variables exhibited the most variability and, therefore, the most information in the data. Subsequently, we used the Partitioning Around Medoids clustering approach to investigate naturally occurring clusters of students and how these clusters relate to overall performance in the course. Our results show that overall performance in the course, as measured by the final course grade, is strongly associated with (1) the behavioral interactions of students with the adaptive platform and (2) their performance on the adaptive learning assessments. We also found distinct student clusters (as defined by success in the course) that exhibited distinctly different behaviors. These findings provide qualitative and quantitative information to identify students needing support and to craft an evidence-based support strategy for these students.

This paper looks at how globalisation, remittances, human capital, foreign direct investment, and financial growth affect carbon dioxide emissions in landlocked African countries from 1980 to 2018. The study looks at the elasticities between study factors by using second-generation tests, as well as Continuously-updated and Fully Modified (Cup-FM) and Continuously-updated and Bias-Corrected (Cup-BC) tests. The results show that remittances, human capital, natural resources, and income growth all make the environment worse by increasing CO2 emissions, whilst globalisation, foreign direct investment, and financial development all make it better by reducing emissions. The panel causality analysis shows that there are two ways in which transfers and CO2 emissions cause each other, but only one way in which CO2 emissions cause globalisation. Globalisation should be implemented sustainably to avoid irreversible long-term environmental impacts that deprive future generations of the chance to prosper or maintain their quality of life. It should also empower people and reduce inequality in landlocked countries.

One of them is the overdosed acetaminophen (APAP), which is metabolized into N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), an excessive toxic metabolite, by CYP2E1, resulting in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), exhausted glutathione (GSH), and thereafter hepatocyte necrosis. N-acetylcysteine is the Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for detoxification of APAP, but it has limited clinical application due to the short therapeutic time window and concentration-related adverse effects. In this study, a carrier-free and bilirubin dotted nanoparticle (B/BG@N) is developed, which is formed using bilirubin and 18 beta-Glycyrrhetinic acid, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) is then adsorbed to mimic the in vivo behavior of the conjugated bilirubin for hitchhiking. The results demonstrate that B/BG@N can effectively reduce the production of NAPQI as well as exhibit antioxidant effects against intracellular oxidative stress via regulating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1 signal axis and reducing the production of inflammatory factors. In vivo study shows that B/BG@N can effectively improve the clinical symptom of the mice model. This study suggests that B/BG@N own increases circulation half-life, improves accumulation in the liver, and dual detoxification, providing a promising strategy for clinical ALF treatment.

Density dependence of seed dispersal and fecundity profoundly alters the spread dynamics of plant populations	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						common garden experiment; invasion by extremes; mechanistic model; plant invasion; population dynamics; range expansion; range filling; seed dispersal by wind	RANGE EXPANSION; GENE FLOW; INVASION; DEMOGRAPHY; EVOLUTION; WIND; MECHANISMS; PLASTICITY; MODELS; SPEEDS	1. Plant population spread has fundamental ecological and evolutionary importance. Both determinants of plant population spread, fecundity and dispersal, can be density-dependent, which should cause feedback between population densities and spread dynamics. Yet it is poorly understood how density-dependence affects key characteristics of spread: spread rate at which the location of the furthest forward individual moves, edge depth (the geographical area over which individuals contribute to spread) and population continuity (occupancy of the spreading population). 2. We present a general modelling framework for analysing the effects of density-dependent fecundity and dispersal on population spread and parameterize this framework with experimental data from a common-garden experiment using five wind-dispersed plant species grown at different densities. 3. Our model shows that density-dependent fecundity and dispersal strongly affect all three population spread characteristics for both exponential and lognormal dispersal kernels. Spread rate and edge depth are strongly correlated but show weaker correlations with population continuity. Positive density-dependence of fecundity increases all three spread characteristics. Increasingly positive density-dependence of dispersal increases spread rate and edge depth but generally decreases population continuity. Density-dependent fecundity and dispersal are largely additive in their effect on spread characteristics. For population continuity, the joint effects of density-dependent fecundity and dispersal are somewhat contingent on the dispersal kernel. 4. The common-garden experiment and the experimentally parameterized mechanistic dispersal model revealed density-dependent fecundity and dispersal across study species. All study species exhibited negatively density-dependent fecundity, but they differed qualitatively in the density-dependence of dispersal distance and probability of long-distance dispersal. The negative density-dependence of fecundity and dispersal found for three species reinforced each other in reducing spread rate and edge depth. The positively density-dependent dispersal found for two species markedly increased spread rate and edge depth. Population continuity was hardly affected by population density in all study species except Crepis sancta in which it was strongly reduced by negatively density-dependent fecundity. 5. Synthesis. Density-dependent fecundity and seed dispersal profoundly alter population spread. In particular, positively density-dependent dispersal should promote the spread and genetic diversity of plant populations migrating under climate change but also complicate the control of invasive species.

This study aimed to characterize SARS-CoV-2 intrahost evolution in five immunocompromised in comparison with five immunocompetent COVID-19 patients during treatment. We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) on collected two oropharyngeal samples from immunocompromised and immunocompetent COVID-19 patients before and after treatment. In this study, we detected alpha and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. The most common substitutions in structural proteins in patients with alpha variant were S-& UDelta;Y143-144, A570D, D614G and D1118H, and N-R203K and G204R, and in delta variant S-T19R, G142D, E156G, 157-158del, L452R, T478K, D614G, D950N and N-D63G, R203M and D377Y were dominant. The common variations in nonstructural and accessory proteins including nsp3-A488S, P1228L, nsp6-T77A, nsp12-P323L, G671S, nsp13-P77L, NS3-S26L, and NS7a-T120I were detected. Also some infrequent substitutions were seen in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. After treatment, nsp12-V166A was emerged as a remdesivir resistance and S-L452M in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency. S-E484Q was detected in a patient with acute lymphoma leukemia. This study showed the possibility of the genetic diversity and development of some new mutations in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, surveillance of these patients to characterize any new variants is necessary.

Scavenger and herbivore functional role impairment modulates changes in plant communities following mass mortality events	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						carrion ecology; plant community; resource pulses; scavenger; trophic cascade; wildlife die-off	PERIODICAL CICADAS INCREASE; CANOPY CLOSURE; PULSES	Mass mortality events (MMEs) of wildlife are increasingly frequent and may destabilize communities. MMEs provide a unique ecological context because they simultaneously produce a resource pulse that is sometimes coupled with the loss or severe impairment of functional roles such as predation or herbivory. Moreover, these effects are complicated by global declines in obligate vertebrate scavengers.We designed an experiment to measure the relative importance of bottom-up (nutrient addition) and top-down (impairment of obligate scavenger and herbivore functional roles) forces experienced during MMEs on the local plant community.Increasing carrion biomass shifted local plant assemblages from the original state promoting plants more resistant to soil disturbance (i.e. annual plants), but this effect was unique to carrion as the same amount of macronutrients entering the system did not affect the plant community. This may indicate that the effects of carrion are primarily driven by interactions with consumers rather than bottom-up processes. Additionally, restricting obligate vertebrate scavenger access to increasing amounts of carrion biomass shifted the net effects of the carrion on the plant community by limiting perennial vines. Impairment of the herbivore functional role released plants from top-down control, increasing plant growth and survival.Our experiment indicates that top-down forces may have strong effects on plant communities following MMEs. As such, the global increase in wildlife MMEs may have broad consequences on ecological communities, not only on the species affected.	[Baruzzi, C.; Strickland, B. K.; Lashley, M.

EFSA investigated the origin of the current EU MRLs. For existing EU MRLs that reflect previously authorised uses in the EU, or that are based on obsolete Codex Maximum Residue Limits, or import tolerances that are not required any longer, EFSA proposed the lowering to the limit of quantification. EFSA performed an indicative chronic and acute dietary risk assessment for the revised list of MRLs to allow risk managers to take the appropriate decisions. For some commodities under assessment, further risk management discussions are required to decide which of the risk management options proposed by EFSA should be implemented in the EU MRL legislation.				pesticides.mrl@efsa.europa.eu	Bellisai, Giulia/ISU-4238-2023						16	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA		1831-4732		EFSA J	EFSA J.

J.			Experiences and recommendations of veterinarians for the Dutch disciplinary system-a survey-based study	VETERINARY RECORD OPEN			English	Article							DEFENSIVE MEDICINE	IntroductionIn the Netherlands, the veterinary disciplinary system is governmentally executed and was originally designed to provide an educational effect on veterinarians as part of maintaining quality standards. MethodsOver 900 veterinarians were questioned (20% of the total number of veterinarians working in veterinary medicine in the Netherlands). It was ascertained whether or not they were aware of the disciplinary system, if it affected their way of working and what impact it had on their way of working after having faced a disciplinary case. Respondents were given the opportunity to express their opinions about the system and possible improvements. ResultsThe risk of complaints was found to be significantly greater when a veterinarian owned a practice compared to veterinarians who were employees. Veterinarians with their own practice were generally older (male) veterinarians. Whether this was a direct effect or just the effect of having a longer career could not be answered. Multiple disciplinary procedures appeared to have no influence. In 13%, veterinarians indicated that the disciplinary system had led to a more defensive way of practicing medicine to avoid complaints. Discussion and conclusionsMost veterinarians supported a disciplinary system as a tool for maintaining and improving the integrity and reputation of the profession as a whole. Recommendations to improve were (1) shortening the length of the procedure, (2) screening for validity, (3) using online systems for communication with the disciplinary council, (4) the option of mediation before getting involved in a full procedure and (5) instituting a complaint fee.

The displacement cross sections of monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are measured using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy in near ultra-high vacuum at primary beam energies between 50 and 90 keV. Damage rates below 80 keV are up to three orders of magnitude lower than previously measured at edges under poorer residual vacuum conditions, where chemical etching appears to dominate. Notably, it is possible to create single vacancies in hBN using electron irradiation, with boron almost twice as likely as nitrogen to be ejected below 80 keV. Moreover, any damage at such low energies cannot be explained by elastic knock-on, even when accounting for the vibrations of the atoms. A theoretical description is developed to account for the lowering of the displacement threshold due to valence ionization resulting from inelastic scattering of probe electrons, modeled using charge-constrained density functional theory molecular dynamics. Although significant reductions are found depending on the constrained charge, quantitative predictions for realistic ionization states are currently not possible. Nonetheless, there is potential for defect-engineering of hBN at the level of single vacancies using electron irradiation.	[Bui, Thuy An; Leuthner, Gregor T.; Madsen, Jacob; Monazam, Mohammad R.

Previous research has not thoroughly investigated the association between PSaC and pain-related psychological factors. Therefore, there is an opportunity to use current pain models, such as the Fear Avoidance Model (FAM), as a framework to explore these relationships. The goals of this integrative review are to (1) identify and describe range of evidence that explores relationships between psychological factors and clinical outcomes in patients with PSaC, and (2) develop a comprehensive understanding of FAM-specific psychological factors that have been identified as potential predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with PSaC. MethodsThis review will be based on principles and stages of an integrative review which will allow for inclusion of diverse methodologies: (1) problem formulation, (2) literature search, (3) data evaluation, (4) data analysis, and (5) presentation. Methods for reporting this review will be informed by the 2020 PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. DiscussionThe findings from this integrative review will inform healthcare professionals working in post-concussion rehabilitation settings regarding relationships between FAM psychological factors and PSaC-an area that until recently has not been thoroughly explored. Additionally, this review will inform the development of other reviews and clinical studies to further investigate relationships between FAM psychological factors and PSaC.

In this study, a uniform sampling-based neural network (NN) is constructed based on the popular RandLA-Net. The uniform sampling can ensure high efficiency and stable spatial coverage. In the proposed NN, a local extra feature encoding structure is designed, and it is combined with local geometric spatial encoding and attention mechanisms to enhance the distinctiveness of depth features and improve the geometric detail preservation ability of the network. The VLS point cloud dataset of motorway scenes collected in this study is labelled for network training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed network over the state-of-the-art networks, attaining the highest intersection-over-union (IoU) on the majority of categories and a 4.39% improvement in mean IoU on all categories. For the pole-shaped targets, the improvement in IoU is 9.08% relative to those of the compared methods. The labelled VLS point cloud dataset generated in this work will be made publicly available.

Three novel iridium (III) complexes, Ir(dnfppy)(2)(Cl/pyrrole), Ir(dfppy)(2)(dpp), and Ir(tfmqz)(2)(sdpp), have been synthesized and characterized, respectively. These iridium (III) complexes emitted deep-blue, blue, and red photoluminescence with high quantum yields (Ir(dnfppy)(2)(Cl/Pyrrole): lambda(max) = 447 nm, F = 62.4%; Ir(dfppy)(2)(dpp): lambda(max) = 467 nm, F = 25%; Ir(tfmqz)(2)(sdpp): lambda(max) = 609 nm, F = 73.7%). Compared with Ir(dnfppy)(2)(Cl/pyrrole), the HOMO energy levels of Ir(dfppy)(2)(dpp) and Ir(tfmqz)(2)(sdpp) were calculated to be -5.71/-5.73 eV, and the LUMO energy levels were increased to be -2.75/-3.36 eV, respectively. The circular dichroism spectra of two pairs of the enantiomers for Ir(dfppy)(2)(dpp) or Ir(tfmqz)(2)(sdpp) displayed symmetry with opposite polarization between 300 and 600 nm. The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE(max)) of OLEDs based on Ir(tfmpqz)(2)(sddp) was 13.8%, showing a relatively low efficiency roll-off with the EQE of 10.7% at 5000 cd/m(2).

A Bayesian approach for analyzing crop yield response data with limited treatments	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							NITROGEN-FERTILIZER; MODELS	This paper proposes a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach to incorporate response parameters from published studies into crop yield response estimation procedures when nonlimiting or limiting treatment levels are omitted or limited in agronomic experiments. Such circumstances may be encountered when data are from farmer-led research, which may use nonstandardized experimental designs. The paper's focus is on maize yield response to nitrogen fertilizer, but the procedure is flexible enough to accommodate other factors that could affect crop yield response. A proof-of-concept Monte Carlo (MC) exercise supplements an empirical application. The MC simulation investigates the small sample properties of the proposed procedure. The empirical example uses field trial data for a maize planter experiment under different nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates. The planter trial compared mechanical planting methods to methods used in developing countries with limited access to mechanized planter technology. Some experiments had no check plots and all experiments lacked nonlimiting fertilizer rates. Linear and quadratic response functions with plateaus are used in the MC simulation and empirical application. MC results suggest that estimates were closest to true parameter values when priors for optimal N rates from published sources were used.	[Cho, Whoi; Lambert, Dayton M.; Brorsen, B.

The Medicines and Healthcare Product Regulatory Agency has been evaluating the available models for a number of medicines cleared by hepatic clearance mechanisms. Models were evaluated for metoprolol, tacrolimus, clindamycin, ondansetron, phenytoin, caffeine, fluoxetine, clozapine, carbamazepine, metronidazole, and paracetamol. The hepatic metabolism through cytochrome P450 (CYP) contributes significantly to the elimination of these drugs, and available knowledge of CYP changes during pregnancy has been implemented in the existing pregnancy physiology models. In general, models were able to capture trends in exposure changes in pregnancy to some extent, but the magnitude of pharmacokinetic change for these hepatically cleared drugs was not captured in each case, nor were models always able to capture overall exposure in the populations. A thorough evaluation was hampered by the lack of clinical data for drugs cleared by a specific clearance pathway. The limited clinical data, as well as complex elimination pathways involving CYPs, uridine 5 '-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase and active transporter for many drugs, currently limit the confidence in the prospective use of the models. Pregnancy-related changes in uridine 5 '-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase and transport functions are emerging, and incorporation of such changes in current physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling software is in progress. Filling this gap is expected to further enhance predictive performance of models and increase the confidence in predicting PK changes in pregnant women for hepatically cleared drugs.

Detection of skin wrinkles and quantification of roughness using a novel image processing technique from a dermatoscope device	SKIN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						efficacy evaluation; image processing; skin; wrinkles	TOPOGRAPHY	ObjectiveCutaneous relief analysis is crucial in the development of new skincare products, as well as in the evaluation of dermatological treatments. The analysis can be performed by qualitative or quantitative methods. We propose a new algorithm to detect wrinkles and quantify skin roughness by image processing from a dermatoscope. MethodsA clinical study was carried out with 33 research participants, and images were collected with the dermatoscope and PRIMOS equipment for wrinkle evaluation at two different times: Day 0 (D0) and 45 days (D45) after the use of a dermocosmetic product. Later, a new algorithm was developed to detect wrinkles in the acquired images by applying filters and image transformations that generate a segmented image highlighting the wrinkles. A roughness calculation method is proposed from the pixels belonging to wrinkles. ResultsCorrelation between the values obtained by the PRIMOS equipment and the proposed system was verified. No correlation was found for data obtained at D0; however, there was correlation at time D45 by Spearman's similarity coefficient. By comparing roughness between times D0 and D45, the treatment was statistically significant for both PRIMOS and the proposed methodology data. ConclusionThe wrinkle detection algorithm, in addition to the roughness calculation, demonstrated a sensitivity comparable to the PRIMOS system in evaluating the effectiveness of the dermocosmetic treatment. SignificanceConsidering the simplicity of the dermatoscope design compared to other established devices such as PRIMOS, the proposed system is promising as an alternative for dermatological evaluations.

We have examined the change in spatial configurations and physicochemical factors that result during the transition mechanism from the inactive to the active rhodopsin state via intermediates. During the activation process, many existing atomic contacts are disrupted, and new ones are formed. This is related to the movement of Helix 5, which tilts away from Helix 3 in the intermediate state in lumirhodopsin and moves closer to Helix 3 again in the active state. Similar patterns of changing atomic contacts are observed between Helices 3 and 5 of the adenosine and neurotensin receptors. In addition, residues 220-238 of rhodopsin, which are disordered in the inactive state, fold in the active state before binding to the G alpha, where it catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on the G alpha subunit. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations in the membrane environment revealed that the arrestin binding region adopts a more flexible extended conformation upon phosphorylation, likely promoting arrestin binding and inactivation. In summary, our results provide additional structural understanding of specific rhodopsin activation which might be relevant to other Class A G protein-coupled receptor proteins.

Here, we collected 266 complete cnidarian mitochondrial genomes and re-evaluated the phylogenetic relationships between the major lineages. We described the gene rearrangement patterns of Cnidaria. Anthozoans had significantly greater mitochondrial genome size and lower A + T content than medusozoans. Most of the protein-coding genes in anthozoans such as COX 13, ATP6, and CYTB displayed a faster rate of evolution based on selection analysis. There were 19 distinct patterns of mitochondrial gene order, including 16 unique gene orders in anthozoans and 3 mtDNA gene orders pattern in medusozoans, were identified among cnidarians. The gene order arrangement suggested that a linearized mtDNA structure may be more conducive to Medusozoan mtDNA stability. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the monophyly of the Anthozoa was strongly supported compared to previous mitochondrial genome-based analyses rather than octocorals forming a sister group relationship with medusozoans. In addition, Staurozoa were more closely related to Anthozoa than to Medusozoa. In conclusion, these results largely support the traditional phylogenetic view of the relationships of cnidarians and provide new insights into the evolutionary processes for studying the most ancient animal radiations.

Such gaps are even greater when dealing with basic biological data for biodiverse environments like the Amazon Rainforest. Therefore, studies that address, classify, and standardize functional traits allow the elaboration of a wide range of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. Moreover, such endeavors aid conservation and management planning by providing a better understanding of which functional traits are filtered or favored under environmental changes. Here, our main goal was to produce a database with 68 functional traits of 218 Odonata species that occur in the Brazilian Amazon. We extracted data on behavior, habit/habitat (larvae and adults), thermoregulation, and geographic distribution from 419 literature sources classified into different research areas. Moreover, we measured 22 morphological traits of approximately 2500 adults and categorized species distributions based on approximately 40,000 geographic records for the Americas. As a result, we provided a functional matrix and identified different functional patterns for the Odonata suborders, as well as a strong relationship between the different trait categories. For this reason, we recommend the selection of key traits that represent a set of functional variables, reducing the sampling effort. In conclusion, we detect and discuss gaps in the literature and suggest research to be developed with the present Amazonian Odonata Trait Bank (AMO-TB).

This complex displays high catalytic activity for the ringopening polymerization (ROP) of lactide in toluene, exceeding the toxic industry standard tin octanoate by a factor of 10. The high catalytic activity of [ZnCl2(TMGeech)] is further demonstrated under industrially preferred melt conditions, reaching high lactide conversions within seconds. To bridge the gap towards a sustainable circular (bio)economy, the catalytic activity of [ZnCl2(TMGeech)] for the chemical recycling of polylactide (PLA) by alcoholysis in THF is investigated. Fast production of different value-added lactates at mild temperatures is demonstrated. Selective PLA degradation from mixtures with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and a polymer blend, catalyst recycling, and a detailed kinetic analysis are presented. For the first time, chemical recycling of post-consumer PET producing different value-added materials is demonstrated using a guanidine-based zinc catalyst. Therefore, [ZnCl2(TMGeech)] is a promising, highly active multitool, not only to implement a circular (bio)plastics economy, but also to tackle today's ongoing plastics pollution.

(Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2022) reported that children whose mothers were pregnant when Superstorm Sandy struck the Eastern Seaboard of the United States had elevated risk of psychopathology. Their study leverages data from a unique cohort of children established prior to Sandy that enabled researchers to investigate children's mental health depending on their prenatal exposure to the storm. Their findings add to mounting evidence that various types of prenatal stressors instigate stress responses that are transmitted to the developing fetus and impart enduring risk for neuropsychiatric disorders.

We compared the ILI incidence among immunocompromised population and the general population. MethodWe conducted a prospective cohort study during the 2017-2018 seasonal influenza epidemic, on the electronic platform, which allows the collection of epidemiological crowdsourced data on ILI, directly from the French general population. The immunocompromised population were adults treated with systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or biologics for an autoimmune or chronic inflammatory disease, recruited directly on and also among patients of the departments of a single university hospital that were asked to incorporate . The general population consisted of adults reporting none of the above treatments or diseases participating in . The incidence of ILI was estimated on a weekly basis and compared between the immunocompromised population and the general population, during the seasonal influenza epidemic. ResultsAmong the 318 immunocompromised patients assessed for eligibility, 177 were included. During the 2017-2018 seasonal influenza epidemic period, immunocompromised population had 1.59 (95% CI: 1.13-2.20) higher odds to experience an ILI episode, compared to the general population (N = 5358). An influenza vaccination was reported by 58% of the immunocompromised population, compared to 41% of the general population (p < 0.001). ConclusionDuring a seasonal influenza epidemic period, the incidence of influenza-like illness was higher in patients treated with immunosuppressants, biologics, and/or corticosteroids for an autoimmune or chronic inflammatory disease, compared to the general population.

Feasibility of high-density electric source imaging in the presurgical workflow: Effect of number of spikes and automated spike detection	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						amount of IEDs; automation; electric source imaging; focal epilepsy; high-density EEG; Presurgical evaluation	INTERICTAL EPILEPTIC DISCHARGES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; LOCALIZING VALUE; EEG SPIKES; SCALP EEG; SURGERY; LOBE; AGREEMENT; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION	Objective: Presurgical high-density electric source imaging (hdESI) of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) is only used by few epilepsy centers. One obstacle is the time-consuming workflow both for recording as well as for visual review. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of (a) an automated IED detection and (b) the number of IEDs on the accuracy of hdESI and time-effectiveness. Methods: In 22 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy receiving epilepsy surgery (Engel 1) we retrospectively detected IEDs both visually and semi-automatically using the EEG analysis software Persyst in 256-channel EEGs. The amount of IEDs, the Euclidean distance between hdESI maximum and resection zone, and the operator time were compared. Additionally, we evaluated the intra-individual effect of IED quantity on the distance between hdESI maximum of all IEDs and hdESI maximum when only a reduced amount of IEDs were included. Results: There was no significant difference in the number of IEDs between visually versus semi-automatically marked IEDs (74 +/- 56 IEDs/patient vs 116 +/- 115 IEDs/patient). The detection method of the IEDs had no significant effect on the mean distances between resection zone and hdESI maximum (visual: 26.07 +/- 31.12 mm vs semi-automated: 33.6 +/- 34.75 mm). However, the mean time needed to review the full datasets semi-automatically was shorter by 275 +/- 46 min (305 +/- 72 min vs 30 +/- 26 min, P < 0.001).The distance between hdESI of the full versus reduced amount of IEDs of the same patient was smaller than 1 cm when at least a mean of 33 IEDs were analyzed. There was a significantly shorter intraindividual distance between resection zone and hdESI maximum when 30 IEDs were analyzed as compared to the analysis of only 10 IEDs (P < 0.001). Significance: Semi-automatized processing and limiting the amount of IEDs analyzed (similar to 30-40 IEDs per cluster) appear to be time-saving clinical tools to increase the practicability of hdESI in the presurgical work-up.

We identified 11 major categories from splenic leukocyte preparations, including neutrophils, natural killer cells, macrophages/myeloid cells, T cells, B cells, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, mast cells, remnants of endothelial cells, erythroid cells, erythroid progenitors, and a new type of serpin-secreting cells. Notably, we derived 54 potential subsets from these 11 categories. These subsets showed differential responses to spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection, implying that they have diverse roles in antiviral immunity. Additionally, we landscaped the populations with the induced expression of interferons and other virus-responsive genes. We found that trained immunity can be effectively induced in the neutrophil and M1-macrophage subsets by vaccinating zebrafish with inactivated SVCV. Our findings illustrated the complexity and heterogeneity of the fish immune system, which will help establish a new paradigm for the improved understanding of fish immunology.

It is often difficult in these cases to maintain oxygenation by face mask ventilation during induction of general anesthesia. Also, the extent and location of these tracheal tumors can preclude conventional induction of general anesthesia and subsequent successful endotracheal intubation. Peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) under local anesthesia and mild intravenous sedation may be safe to support the patient until securing a definitive airway. We describe a case of a 19-year-old female with a tracheal schwannoma, who developed differential hypoxemia (Harlequin, or North-South, syndrome) after institution of awake peripheral femorofemoral venoarterial (VA) partial CBP.

Recent studies have suggested the benefits of using machine learning (ML) to forecast complex medical predictions. We aimed to predict treatment response in patients with PBC using ML and pretreatment data. MethodsWe conducted a single-center retrospective study and collected data from 194 patients with PBC who were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment initiation. Patient data were analyzed with five ML models, namely random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGB), decision tree, naive Bayes, or logistic regression, to predict treatment response using the Paris II criteria. The established models were assessed using an out-of-sample validation. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the efficacy of each algorithm. Overall survival and liver-related deaths were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. ResultsCompared to logistic regression (AUC = 0.595, P = 0.0219, 0.031 models), ML analyses showed significantly high AUC in the random forest (AUC = 0.84) and XGB (AUC = 0.83) models; however, the AUC was not significantly high for decision tree (AUC = 0.633) or naive Bayes (AUC = 0.584) models. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly improved prognoses in patients predicted to achieve the Paris II criteria by XGB (log-rank = 0.005 and 0.007). ConclusionML algorithms could improve treatment response prediction using pretreatment data, which could lead to better prognoses. In addition, the ML model using XGB could predict the prognosis of patients before treatment initiation.

Stimulant medication use, an evidence-based treatment for ADHD, is associated with lower body mass index (BMI) and higher blood pressure among non-overweight youth. ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to examine the longitudinal influence of ADHD and stimulant medication use on BMI and blood pressure among a sample of 456 youth with overweight and obesity treated in a paediatric weight management clinic. MethodsMixed linear modelling examined the main and interactive effects of time by ADHD status and stimulant medication use on BMI and blood pressure. ResultsYouth without ADHD experienced a significantly faster decrease in BMI compared to youth with ADHD (p < 0.001). Youth with ADHD who were taking stimulant medication had a significantly faster decrease in BMI compared to youth with ADHD who were not taking stimulant medication (p = 0.009). There was no significant effect of ADHD status or stimulant medication use on diastolic or systolic blood pressure trajectories over time (ps >0.05). ConclusionsResults from this study suggest that youth with ADHD who are not taking stimulant medication may not benefit from clinical weight management to the same extent as either youth without ADHD or youth with ADHD who are taking a stimulant medication.

Long-term efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in initially acutely ill adults with schizophrenia: systematic review and network meta-analysis	WORLD PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						Antipsychotics; schizophrenia; long-term efficacy; olanzapine; positive symptoms; negative symptoms; all-cause discontinuation; weight gain	SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER; DOUBLE-BLIND; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; OLANZAPINE; HALOPERIDOL; CONSISTENCY; QUETIAPINE; TRIALS; PEOPLE	Most acute phase antipsychotic drug trials in schizophrenia last only a few weeks, but patients must usually take these drugs much longer. We examined the long-term efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in acutely ill patients using network meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group register up to March 6, 2022 for randomized, blinded trials of at least 6-month duration on all second-generation and 18 first-generation antipsychotics. The primary outcome was change in overall symptoms of schizophrenia; secondary outcomes were all-cause discontinuation; change in positive, negative and depressive symptoms; quality of life, social functioning, weight gain, antiparkinson medication use, akathisia, serum prolactin level, QTc prolongation, and sedation. Confidence in the results was assessed by the CINeMA (Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis) framework. We included 45 studies with 11,238 participants. In terms of overall symptoms, olanzapine was on average more efficacious than ziprasidone (standardized mean difference, SMD=0.37, 95% CI: 0.26-0.49), asenapine (SMD=0.33, 95% CI: 0.21-0.45), iloperidone (SMD=0.32, 95% CI: 0.15-0.49), paliperidone (SMD=0.28, 95% CI: 0.11-0.44), haloperidol (SMD=0.27, 95% CI: 0.14-0.39), quetiapine (SMD=0.25, 95% CI: 0.12-0.38), aripiprazole (SMD=0.16, 95% CI: 0.04-0.28) and risperidone (SMD=0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.21). The 95% CIs for olanzapine versus aripiprazole and risperidone included the possibility of trivial effects. The differences between olanzapine and lurasidone, amisulpride, perphenazine, clozapine and zotepine were either small or uncertain. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses and in line with other efficacy outcomes and all-cause discontinuation. Concerning weight gain, the impact of olanzapine was higher than all other antipsychotics, with a mean difference ranging from -4.58 kg (95% CI: -5.33 to -3.83) compared to ziprasidone to -2.30 kg (95% CI: -3.35 to -1.25) compared to amisulpride. Our data suggest that olanzapine is more efficacious than a number of other antipsychotic drugs in the longer term, but its efficacy must be weighed against its side effect profile.

And the endothelium has a great influence on the vasculature throughout the circulatory system, especially in the brain. This study aimed to investigate the mechanistic differences in endothelial injury between atrial fibrillation (AF)- and AS-induced ischemic stroke. All target genes of AF, AS, and the vascular endothelial cell (VC) were obtained from the GeneCards database; the differential genes of AF and AS separately associated with the VC were established by a Venn diagram. A protein-protein interaction network was created, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases were used to perform genomic enrichment and functional enrichment analysis. Hub genes were selected by Maximal Clique Centrality algorithm ranking and correlation linkage in the STRING database, and then, clinical serum samples were used to verify the quantitative expressions in the AF, AF stroke, AS, and AS stroke groups. Fifty-five AF-VC-related genes and ninety-three AS-VC-related genes were screened, which differed in biological function, cellular composition, and molecular function. The genes correlation between AF and vascular endothelial cells (VCs) was KRAS and PTPN11, and those correlation between AS and VCs was IL-4, IFNG, IL-17A, and CSF-2. IL-4 and CSF-2 may be relevant proteins involved in the differences in stroke mechanisms between AF and AS, and they may act by further influencing the function of their downstream cells. This study provides a preliminary theoretical basis for investigating the differences in mechanisms of endothelial injury between AF- and AS-induced ischemic stroke.

We included 5564 patients under the age of 18 years who visited the hospital in which the study took place from December 2020 to November 2022 with a primary diagnosis of acute diarrhea. Clinical information was extracted from the electronic health record system. We calculated the prevalence of norovirus infection by age, gender, season, year, and type of patients. A nonlinear association between age and prevalence rates was assessed using a restricted cubic spline regression model. A total of 5564 patients completed the test for human norovirus, among whom 1442 (25.9%) tested positive. The prevalence of norovirus infection was significantly lower in 2022 than in 2021 (35.9% vs. 53.7%, p < 0.001), and the highest prevalence was observed in winter (35.1%) and then followed by autumn (27.5%). Regarding the age pattern, the highest rate was seen in children aged 1-3 years (37.5%). Children at age 1.5 years may have the highest risk of having norovirus infection (P-nonlinear < 0.001). The prevalence of norovirus infection of norovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to that before the pandemic shown in literatures. A relatively high rate was observed in cool seasons and in younger children (i.e., 1-3 years).

Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by independent pairs. Comparable numerical data were statistically synthesized using random-effects robust variance estimation. ResultsIn total, 114 studies were included out of 8819 papers obtained from database searches. Birth order >= 2 versus 1 was associated with lower risk of ever atopic dermatitis (pooled risk ratio [RR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-0.98), current food allergy (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.90), and positive skin prick test (SPT) to common aeroallergens (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97). Sibship size >= 2 versus 1 was associated with decreased risk of current atopic dermatitis (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.98), ever atopic dermatitis (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.97), and positive SPT to common aeroallergens (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.92). No putative associations were seen regarding atopy assessed through allergen-specific immunoglobulin E with common allergens. ConclusionThe presence of siblings and being second-born or later may decrease the lifetime risk of atopic dermatitis and food allergy, albeit marginally. Similar association was seen with SPT sensitization. However, significant protection was not found for IgE sensitization.

Herein, we investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of AF in association with OSA in a cohort of cardiac surgery patients. A prospective study including patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Biomarkers reflective of AF pathophysiology (interleukin [IL-6], C-reactive protein [CRP], von Willebrand factor [vWF], N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP], high-sensitivity Troponin T [hs-TnT], and Galectin-3 [Gal-3]) was assessed by functional or immunological assays. miRNAs involved in AF were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using atrial tissue samples, fibrosis was assessed by Masson's trichrome. Connexin 40 and 43 (Cx40; Cx43) were evaluated by immunolabeling. Fifty-six patients (15 with OSA and 41 non-OSA) were included in this hypothesis-generating pilot study. OSA group had a higher incidence of postoperative AF (POAF) (46.7% vs. 19.5%; p = .042), presented an increased risk of POAF (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.01-12.92), and had significantly higher baseline levels of NT-proBNP (p = .044), vWF (p = .049), Gal-3 (p = .009), IL-6 (p = .002), and CRP (p = .003). This group presented lower levels of miR-21 and miR-208 (both p < .05). Also, lower Cx40 levels in POAF and/or OSA patients (50.0% vs. 81.8%, p = .033) were found. The presence of interstitial fibrosis (according to myocardial collagen by Masson's trichrome) was raised in OSA patients (86.7% vs. 53.7%, p = .024). Several biomarkers and miRNAs involved in inflammation and fibrosis were dysregulated in OSA patients, which together with a higher degree of interstitial fibrosis, altered miRNA, and Cxs expression predisposes to the development of a substrate that increases the AF risk.

A 62-year-old man using high-dose inhaled corticosteroid visited our hospital because of poorly-controlled asthma. He had eosinophilia in peripheral blood and sputum, and high levels of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide. Therefore, he was treated with mepolizumab for severe asthma. Mepolizumab treatment resulted in significantly improved pulmonary function and reduced frequencies of asthma exacerbations. Because of his good asthma control, mepolizumab treatment was discontinued after 3 years. Since discontinuing mepolizumab, his asthma control has remained without exacerbation. Previous studies suggest that mepolizumab should be continued to sustain clinical benefits. However, cases of long-term controlled asthma have not been reported after mepolizumab withdrawal, and our case may be instructive.

First the authors build a mathematical model based on the Z-transform, then they input the LFM signal into the modified FRI system and process the output of the system based on this mathematical model, which enables the estimation of the parameters of the LFM signal using only four sampling points. The error of the final experimental results can be controlled within 3%, which greatly improves the efficiency of LFM signal parameter estimation.

Metastasis from elsewhere should be excluded first. The tumor is a very aggressive with poor prognosis. No standard treatment approaches are available. Managed by surgical excision followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is an exceedingly rare disease, and its management is still unclear. A-65-year-old lady presented with a progressive swelling of her right breast that started spontaneously. Other potential primary sites were ruled out. She was kept on a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (AC-T protocol) of doxorubicin, adriamycin, and paclitaxel. Later, she was underwent modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Her post-operative recovery was uneventful. Currently, she is followed up at oncology outpatient clinic.

The predatory mites Amblyseius montdorensis Schicha, Neoseiulus cucumeris (Oudemans), and Amblyseius andersoni (Chant) were used to control the populations of thrips and greenhouse whiteflies. The dose of these entomophagous species applied was 8 to 10 individuals m(-2) per plant every 3 wk. To fight spider mite, the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot was used at the rate of 1 individual m(-2) every 3 wk as a preventive measure. The parasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck was released to suppress melon aphid (A. gossypii). The long-term observations of the population dynamics of pests and the use of natural enemies to manage pests at the local level will enable us to adjust the dose of entomophages applied depending on the geographical location of the greenhouse facility, the regional climatic conditions, and weather conditions typical of certain years, etc. According to these factors, the results of this study are applicable to other greenhouse facilities with similar conditions. In future, the authors intend to elucidate an optimized method of using entomophagous species for farms located in warmer regions.

Here, the biochemical and structural properties of MTHFR from a virulent strain of N. meningitidis serogroup B (NmMTHFR) were characterized. Unlike other orthologs, NmMTHFR functions as a unique homohexamer, composed of three homo-dimerization partners, as shown in our 2.7 angstrom resolution crystal structure. Six active sites were formed solely within monomers and located away from the oligomerization interfaces. Flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor formed hydrogen bonds with conserved sidechains, positioning its isoalloxazine ring adjacent to the overlapping binding sites of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) coenzyme and CH2-H(4)folate substrate. NmMTHFR utilized NADH (K-m = 44 mu M) as an electron donor in the NAD(P)H-CH2-H(4)folate oxidoreductase assay, but not nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) which is the donor required in human MTHFR. In silico analysis and mutagenesis studies highlighted the significant difference in orientation of helix alpha 7A (Phe215-Thr225) with that in the human enzyme. The extended sidechain of Met221 on helix alpha 7A plays a role in stabilizing the folded structure of NADH in the hydrophobic box. This supports the NADH specificity by restricting the phosphate group of NADPH that causes steric clashes with Glu26. The movement of Met221 sidechain allows the CH2-H(4)folate substrate to bind. The unique topology of its NADH and CH2-H(4)folate binding pockets makes NmMTHFR a promising drug target for the development of new antimicrobial agents that may possess reduced off-target side effects.

However, limited electrochemical stability of water and issues related to complex aqueous chemistry, component corrosion, and materials dissolution limit their lifetime. Oxygen reduction reaction is considered to be the main parasitic process in aqueous Na-ion batteries leading to self-discharge, materials degradation and Na-ion inventory loss. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on novel electrolyte design which allows to mitigate the main parasitic reactions and prepare capacity balanced (N/P=1) aqueous battery cells. For this purpose, aqueous symmetric Na2VTi(PO4)(3)|Na2VTi(PO4)(3) system is used as a model to demonstrate that the introduction of a small concentration of strongly reducing agent such as hydrazine into purely aqueous or hybrid (water and dimethyl sulphoxide) electrolyte could chemically reduce the dissolved oxygen and significantly improve the capacity retention of N/P=1 cells during cycling. The low concentrations and self-consuming nature of hydrazine in a closed cell do not pose any health or chemical risks and presents a viable strategy for practical design. We believe, these results to be applicable not only to aqueous Na-ion batteries but also other aqueous or hybrid battery chemistries where such parasitic processes play a significant role.

This study evaluates mental health outcomes for OA compared to younger adults (YA; <55 years of age) receiving CBT. Design: This is a pre-post study comparing the effectiveness of CBT for OA (n = 99) and YA (n = 601) in a CBT service located in a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Canada. Data was collected between 2001 and 2021. Participants received a mean of 18.5 sessions (SD 10) of standard, evidence-based CBT with treatment integrity checks. The main outcome was clinically significant change, as measured by the Reliable Change Index (RCI). Secondary outcomes were change in the Global Severity Index (GSI-SCL) of the Symptoms Checklist-90 (Revised), and Clinical Global Improvement scores (CGI). Results: The RCI allowed a comparison of treatment efficacy across diagnoses. Both groups experienced similar improvement on the RCI (2.92 [.3.64] vs. 3.15 [.4.86], p = 0.65). Furthermore, 39% of OA and 42% of YA no longer met criteria for their diagnoses. Groups did not differ with respect to changes in the GSI-SCL. The CGI severity comparison suggested that OA had milder illness. In all outcomes (RCI, CGI and GSI-SCL), participants improved over time. Conclusions: This real-world study analyzed a large sample of OA and YA undergoing CBT for various mental health conditions. Both groups were found to benefit equally.

Currently, strategies to enhance the reaction performance through elaborate catalyst design have been well developed, but it is still of challenge to realize the promotion of reactivity and selectivity at the same time. Instead, a facile method of catalyst modification with ionic liquid to modulate the electrode surface microenvironment that mimic the role of the natural MoFe protein environment is found effective for the simultaneous improvement of NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a low NaNO3 concentration of 500 ppm. Protic ionic liquid (PIL) N-butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bim]NTf2) modified Co3O4-x is fabricated and affords the NH3 yield rate and FE of 30.23 +/- 4.97 mg h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) and 84.74 +/- 3.43 % at -1.71 and -1.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, outperforming the pristine Co3O4-x. Mechanistic and theoretical studies reveal that the PIL modification facilitates the adsorption and activation of NO3- as well as the NO3--to-NH3 conversion and inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction competition via enhancing the Lewis acidity of the Co center, shuttling protons, and constructing a hydrogen bonded and hydrophobic electrode surface microenvironment.

J	Queloz, M				Queloz, Matthieu			On the self-undermining functionality critique of morality	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY			English	Editorial Material							NIETZSCHE	Nietzsche's injunction to examine "the value of values" can be heard in a pragmatic key, as inviting us to consider not whether certain values are true, but what they do for us. This oddly neglected pragmatic approach to Nietzsche now receives authoritative support from Bernard Reginster's new book, which offers a compelling and notably cohesive interpretation of Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality. In this essay, I reconstruct Reginster's account of Nietzsche's critique of morality as a "self-undermining functionality critique" and raise three problems for it: (i) Is there room within an etiological conception of function for the notion of self-undermining functionality? (ii) If Nietzsche's critique is internal and based solely on the function it ascribes to morality, where does that critique derive its normative significance from? (iii) Does Reginster's account not make out ascetic morality to be more universally dysfunctional than it is, given that some priestly types have done remarkably well out of morality?

To inform implementation, we analysed PrEP awareness, discussion and interest in taking LAI-PrEP among Filipina transfeminine adults. MethodsWe utilized secondary data from the #ParaSaAtin survey that sampled Filipina transfeminine adults (n = 139) and conducted a series of multivariable logistic regressions with lasso selection to explore factors independently associated with PrEP outcomes, including awareness, discussion with trans friends and interest in LAI-PrEP. ResultsOverall, 53% of Filipina transfeminine respondents were aware of PrEP, 39% had discussed PrEP with their trans friends and 73% were interested in LAI-PrEP. PrEP awareness was associated with being non-Catholic (p = 0.017), having previously been HIV tested (p = 0.023), discussing HIV services with a provider (p<0.001) and having high HIV knowledge (p = 0.021). Discussing PrEP with friends was associated with older age (p = 0.040), having experienced healthcare discrimination due to transgender identity (p = 0.044), having HIV tested (p = 0.001) and having discussed HIV services with a provider (p < 0.001). Very interested in LAI-PrEP was associated with living in Central Visayas (p = 0.045), having discussed HIV services with a provider (p = 0.001) and having discussed HIV services with a sexual partner (p = 0.008). ConclusionsImplementing LAI-PrEP in the Philippines requires addressing systemic improvements across personal, interpersonal, social and structural levels in healthcare access, including efforts to create healthcare settings and environments with providers who are trained and competent in transgender health and can address the social and structural drivers of trans health inequities, including HIV and barriers to LAI-PrEP.

Methods: PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched. English language, original studies investigating oncological outcomes of TLM in adult patients with recurrent laryngeal cancer were included. Data were pooled using a distribution-free approach for estimating summary local control (LC), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) curves with random effects. Results: Two hundred and thirty-five patients underwent salvage TLM after primary (chemo)radiotherapy. The mean follow-up time was 60.8 months (95% CI: 32.7-88.9). Estimated pooled LC rates (95% CI) at 1, 3 and 5 years were 74.2% (61.7-89.4), 53.9% (38.5-75.3), and 39.1% (25.2-60.8). Estimated pooled DSS rates (95% CI) at 1, 3 and 5 years were 88.4% (82.0-95.3), 67.8% (50.9-90.3), and 58.9% (42.7-81.1). Two hundred and seventy-one patients underwent TLM after primary laser treatment. The mean follow-up time was 70.9 months (95% CI: 36.9-104.9). Estimated pooled LC rates (95% CI) at 1, 3 and 5 years were 72.2% (64.7-80.6), 53.2% (42.2-66.9), and 40.4% (29.6-55.2). Estimated pooled DSS rates (95% CI) at 1, 3 and 5 years were 92.1% (85.5-99.1), 77.0% (64.4-92.0), and 67.1% (51.6-87.3). Conclusions: TLM is a valuable treatment option for the management of locally recurrent laryngeal carcinoma if performed by experienced surgeons and following rigorous patients' selection criteria. Further studies should be conducted to define stage-based clinical guidelines.

I.			<i>Aedes albopictus</i> microbiome derives from environmental sources and partitions across distinct host tissues	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN			English	Article						Aedes albopictus; environment; microbiome assembly; tissue microbiome	MOSQUITO MICROBIOTA; DENGUE	The mosquito microbiome consists of a consortium of interacting microorganisms that reside on and within culicid hosts. Mosquitoes acquire most of their microbial diversity from the environment over their life cycle. Once present within the mosquito host, the microbes colonize distinct tissues, and these symbiotic relationships are maintained by immune-related mechanisms, environmental filtering, and trait selection. The processes that govern how environmental microbes assemble across the tissues within mosquitoes remain poorly resolved. We use ecological network analyses to examine how environmental bacteria assemble to form bacteriomes among Aedes albopictus host tissues. Mosquitoes, water, soil, and plant nectar were collected from 20 sites in the Manoa Valley, Oahu. DNA was extracted and associated bacteriomes were inventoried using Earth Microbiome Project protocols. We find that the bacteriomes of A. albopictus tissues were compositional taxonomic subsets of environmental bacteriomes and suggest that the environmental microbiome serves as a source pool that supports mosquito microbiome diversity. Within the mosquito, the microbiomes of the crop, midgut, Malpighian tubules, and ovaries differed in composition. This microbial diversity partitioned among host tissues formed two specialized modules: one in the crop and midgut, and another in the Malpighian tubules and ovaries. The specialized modules may form based on microbe niche preferences and/or selection of mosquito tissues for specific microbes that aid unique biological functions of the tissue types. A strong niche-driven assembly of tissue-specific microbiotas from the environmental species pool suggests that each tissue has specialized associations with microbes, which derive from host-mediated microbe selection.

The increased morbidity and mortality among T2DM patients are partly due to dysregulated hemostasis. This study determined the quality of glycemic control in T2DM and its association with markers of coagulation and inhibitors of fibrinolysis. MethodsThis case-control study recruited 90 participants involving: 30 T2DM patients with good glycemic control, 30 with poor glycemic control, and 30 nondiabetic subjects as controls at a Municipal Hospital in Ghana. Fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), calculated international normalized ratio (INR), and full blood count (FBC) were determined for each respondent. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) were determined using the solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Data were analyzed using R language software. ResultsPlasma PAI-1 antigen levels were significantly higher in the participants with poor glycemic control as compared to participants with good glycemic control (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in plasma TAFI levels between the participants with poor glycemic control as compared to participants with good glycemic control (p = 0.900). T2DM patients had significantly shorter APTT, PT, and INR than controls (p < 0.05). At a cut-off of >= 161.70 pg/mu L, PAI was independently associated with increasing odds (adjusted odds ratio = 13.71, 95% confidence interval: 3.67-51.26, p < 0.0001) of poor glycemic control and showed the best diagnostic accuracy for poor glycemic control (area under the curve = 0.85, p < 0.0001). ConclusionPAI-1 levels were significantly increased in T2DM with poor glycemic control and emerged as the best predictor for poor glycemic control. Good glycemic management to control the plasma levels of PAI-1 is required to prevent hypercoagulability and thrombotic disorders.	[Selleh, Peter K.; Anto, Enoch O.; Boadu, Wina I.

This timely frame responds to growing calls for conservation to deliver fair outcomes to people and offers strategic value for meeting environmental goals. To clarify how and why approaches that support nature and equity may emerge, this commentary draws on conservation efforts in five different social and political settings. Building on practitioner experiences in Australia, Chile, Kenya, Peru, and Solomon Islands, it identifies a set of equity instruments that recognize local environmental knowledge, rights, and practices, strengthen marginalized voices, and promote fair outcomes, and the enabling conditions that facilitate their use. The article concludes by discussing critical considerations for enhancing nature and equity.

The type of drug use is measured by distinguishing between those who were treated for using hard drugs (e.g., heroin and cocaine) and those who were treated for using soft drugs (cannabis). Extracting data from the initial treatment registration report, social capital is operationalised into seven different LSCC categories, and the total number of LSCC (the LSCC score) is recorded. Based on logistic regressions, the LSCC score shows a strong graded dose-response relationship with hard drug use. With each additional LSCC, the probability of being treated for hard drug use increases with 9%. Parental child abuse is the most important single predictor of being treated for hard drug use. Having been parentally abused as a child raises the probability by 32%. The results hold after controlling for age, initiation age, and number of years of drug use, all of which show a significant reversed U-shaped relationship with hard drug use.

However, the m7G modification of circRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains to be investigated. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) was used to measure the methylation levels of m7G and identify m7G sites in circRNAs in human OSCC and normal tissues. The host genes of differentially methylated and differentially expressed circRNAs were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were predicted using the miRanda and miRDB databases. The analysis identified 2348 m7G peaks in 624 circRNAs in OSCC tissues. In addition, the source of m7G-methylated circRNAs in OSCC was mainly the sense overlap region compared with normal tissues. The most conserved m7G motif in OSCC tissues was CCUGU, whereas the most conserved motif in normal tissues was RCCUG (R = G/A). Importantly, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the host genes of differentially methylated and differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in many cellular biological functions. Furthermore, the significantly differentially expressed circRNAs were analyzed to predict the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks. This study revealed the whole profile of circRNAs of differential m7G methylation in OSCC and suggests that m7G-modified circRNAs may impact the development of OSCC.

Previous hypotheses on parasite-related invasion mainly focus on the lack of parasites against invasive pests or the introduction of parasites with a higher risk to native pests. Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is a new invasive pest in China. Here, we investigated pathogen infection in eight natural populations of FAW in China, isolated and characterised the pathogens, and then evaluated the infection risk of the pathogens to native pests. The pathogen infection frequencies in FAW were very low (0.32%); only two individuals were found to have typical symptoms of fungal infection, and the fungi were identified as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium rileyi. Internal transcribed spacer sequence-based analysis showed that among 44 B. bassiana isolates worldwide, the SFJS01 isolate was genetically different from only 3 isolates. Among all 13 isolates of M. rileyi from FAW, including the SFGX01 isolate, there was no significant differentiation. Comparison of the mortality caused by B. bassiana SFJS01 or M. rileyi SFGX01 against S. frugiperda, Spodoptera litura, Bemisia tabaci, Laodelphax striatellus and Nilaparvata lugens showed that the new isolates all had the highest virulence to S. frugiperda and the lowest virulence to S. litura, a native pest closely related to FAW. The findings indicated that pathogens isolated from FAW did not pose a high risk to native pests and that they did not play a key role in the successful invasion of the FAW in China.

The stigma of parental problems and contact with CPS are barriers to recruiting children. This article investigates how such barriers are experienced and handled by professional support group leaders. The empirical data is drawn from five group interviews with 16 professionals, recruited from a purposive sample of nine local authorities in Sweden. It is found that professionals experience stigma as a barrier to recruiting children, mainly the parents' shame but also their fear of CPS involvement. Professionals describe parents' problems on a 'scale of shamefulness', ranging from divorce to domestic violence, and the barriers vary in strength relative to the shamefulness of the problem. Parents are gatekeepers for their children's participation, so destigmatizing and shame-reducing strategies, whether on the interpersonal, organizational or structural level, are called for to increase children's access. However, strategies targeting parental shame are not without their challenges and risks.

We report the current knowledge about human lymphatic vessel contractility and capability of adaptation. A literature search in PubMed identified studies published January 2000-September 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies investigating parameters related to contraction frequency, fluid velocity, and lymphatic pressure in vivo and ex vivo in human lymphatic vessels. The search returned 2885 papers of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. In vivo vessels revealed baseline contraction frequencies between 0.2 +/- 0.2 and 1.8 +/- 0.1 min(1), velocities between 0.008 +/- 0.002 and 2.3 +/- 0.3 cm/s, and pressures between 4.5 (range 0.5-9.2) and 60.3 +/- 2.8 mm Hg. Gravitational forces, hyperthermia, and treatment with nifedipine caused increases in contraction frequency. Ex vivo lymphatic vessels displayed contraction frequencies between 1.2 +/- 0.1 and 5.5 +/- 1.2 min(-1). Exposure to agents affecting cation and anion channels, adrenoceptors, HCN channels, and changes in diameter-tension properties all resulted in changes in functional parameters as known from the blood vascular system. We find that the lymphatic system is dynamic and adaptable. Different investigative methods yields alternating results. Systematic approaches, consensus on investigative methods, and larger studies are needed to fully understand lymphatic transport and apply this in a clinical context.

Efficacy of hydrogen peroxide to reduce Gyrodactylus species infestation density on four fish species	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH			English	Article						Brook Trout; Fathead Minnow; Gyrodactylus; hydrogen peroxide; Lake Trout; treatment; Yellow Perch	INFECTIONS; MONOGENEA; TROUT; POPULATION; DERJAVINI; EPIDERMIS; SALMONIS	Objective: The ability to effectively treat parasitic infestations of fish is of high importance for fish culture facilities. However, tools or approved therapies for treating infestations on fish are limited. This paper summarizes results from four separate clinical field studies that evaluated the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 35% PEROX-AID) for reducing Gyrodactylus spp. infestation density.Methods: Three species of Gyrodactylus were studied (G. salmonis, hosts: Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis and Lake Trout S. namaycush; G. freemani, host: Yellow Perch Perca flavescens; G. hoffmani, host: Fathead Minnow Pimephales promelas) before and after the application of immersion H2O2 therapy.Result: Parasite density was significantly reduced for each parasite x host combination to which H2O2 therapy was applied. Two clinical field studies in salmonids were found to demonstrate substantial effectiveness that enabled 35% PEROX-AID approval.Conclusion: Further assessments of Gyrodactylus spp. could expand the use of H2O2 for controlling these parasites in aquaculture. Specifically, H2O2 was effective at all levels tested (50 or 75 mg H2O2/L for 60 min for the Yellow Perch and Fathead Minnow clinical field studies; 100 or 150 mg H2O2/L for 30 min regardless of salt pre-treatment for the Brook Trout study; and 100 mg H2O2/L for 30 min or 50 mg H2O2/L for 60 min for the Lake Trout study).

Protein aggregation is an indicator of a decline of PQC linked to aging and disease. Mitochondrial PQC is critical to maintain mitochondrial function and thus cellular fitness. How mitochondria handle aggregated proteins is not well understood. Here we tested how the metabolic status impacts on formation and clearance of aggregates within yeast mitochondria and assessed which proteins are particularly sensitive to denaturation. MethodsConfocal microscopy, electron microscopy, immunoblotting and genetics were applied to assess mitochondrial aggregate handling in response to heat shock and ethanol using the mitochondrial disaggregase Hsp78 as a marker for protein aggregates. ResultsWe show that aggregates formed upon heat or ethanol stress with different dynamics depending on the metabolic state. While fermenting cells displayed numerous small aggregates that coalesced into one large foci that was resistant to clearance, respiring cells showed less aggregates and cleared these aggregates more efficiently. Acute inhibition of mitochondrial translation had no effect, while preventing protein import into mitochondria by inhibition of cytosolic translation prevented aggregate formation. ConclusionCollectively, our data show that the metabolic state of the cells impacts the dynamics of aggregate formation and clearance, and that mainly newly imported and not yet assembled proteins are prone to form aggregates. Because mitochondrial functionality is crucial for cellular metabolism, these results highlight the importance of efficient protein biogenesis to maintain the mitochondrial proteome operational during metabolic adaptations and cellular stress.

Nevertheless, the specific mechanism of its carcinogenesis in breast tumor has not been clarified. This research aims to elucidate the role and the underlying molecular pathways of DYNLT3 on breast cancer tumorigenesis.Methods: The differential expression of DYNLT3 among breast cancer, breast fibroids, and normal tissues, as well as in various breast cancer cell lines were detected by immunohistochemical staining, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, the role of DYNLT3 on cell viability and proliferation were observed through cell counting kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, and colony formation experiments. Migratory and invasive abilities was envaulted by wound healing and Transwell methods. Apoptotic cells rate was examined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, nude mice xenograft models were established to confirm the role of DYNLT3 in tumor formation in vivo.Results: DYNLT3 expression was highly rising in both breast cancer tissues and cells. DYNLT3 knockdown obviously suppressed cell growth, migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The overexpression of DYNLT3 exerted the opposite effect in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, DYNLT3 knockdown inhibited tumor formation in vivo. Mechanistically, an elevation of N-cadherin and vimentin levels and a decline of E-cadherin were observed when DYNLT3 was upregulated, which was reversed when DYNLT3 knockdown was performed.Conclusion: DYNLT3 may function as a tumor-promotor of age-associated breast cancer, which is expected to provide experimental basis for new treatment options.

What does the future look like for kelp when facing multiple stressors?	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						conservation biology; global change; marine ecology; stressor interactions	SACCHARINA-JAPONICA LAMINARIALES; GIANT-KELP; PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSE; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UV-RADIATION; TEMPERATURE; CO2; GROWTH	As primary producers and ecosystem engineers, kelp (generally Order Laminariales) are ecologically important, and their decline could have far-reaching consequences. Kelp are valuable in forming habitats for fish and invertebrates and are crucial for adaptation to climate change by creating coastal defenses and in providing key functions, such as carbon sequestration and food provision. Kelp are threatened by multiple stressors, such as climate change, over-harvesting of predators, and pollution. In this opinion paper, we discuss how these stressors may interact to affect kelp, and how this varies under different contexts. We argue that more research that bridges kelp conservation and multiple stressor theory is needed and outline key questions that should be addressed as a priority. For instance, it is important to understand how previous exposure (either to earlier generations or life stages) determines responses to emerging stressors, and how responses in kelp scale up to alter food webs and ecosystem functioning. By increasing the temporal and biological complexity of kelp research in this way, we will improve our understanding allowing better predictions. This research is essential for the effective conservation and potential restoration of kelp in our rapidly changing world.

Effects of human and nonhuman predation risk on antipredator movement behaviors of an upland game bird	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						coyote; dynamic interaction; hunting; movement ecology; predation risk; resource selection; wild turkey	BROWNIAN BRIDGE MOVEMENT; HABITAT SELECTION; WILD TURKEYS; PREY INTERACTIONS; SITE SELECTION; R PACKAGE; WOLVES; FEAR; ELK; LANDSCAPE	Predators elicit antipredator behaviors such as proactive and reactive movements in prey, but both are rarely investigated simultaneously. Impacts of human predation risk on antipredator behaviors can be greater than those of nonhuman predators, resulting in increased effects on populations and community structure. We compared the influence of human and nonhuman predation risk on proactive and reactive antipredator movement behaviors of male Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo, hereafter turkey). We used simultaneously collected GPS locations from 31 turkeys and 36 coyotes (Canis latrans) to investigate the antipredator behavior of turkeys to coyotes. To assess antipredator behaviors of turkeys to hunters, we used 1661 hunting tracks collected while monitoring 109 turkeys. For proactive movements, we quantified how predation risk influenced resource selection. To investigate reactive movements, we quantified changes in movement behavior of turkeys after encountering hunters and coyotes. Coyote and turkey home range overlap was high, but lack of core area overlap, encounters, and similar resource selection suggested the use of different areas on the landscape. Turkeys selected areas associated with decreased coyote risk and closer to hardwoods. Coyotes preferred shrubs and open areas, suggesting turkeys avoided coyote risk and the habitats coyotes preferred. We detected 17 coyote and turkey contacts, and the probability of contact decreased by 16.6% for every 100 m farther from a forest edge. Turkeys did not display reactive movement behaviors after a direct encounter with coyotes, as step lengths were similar prior to and after encounters, which did not differ from random step lengths. After hunting, turkeys selected areas farther from public access points and closer to private property, suggesting proactive avoidance of hunter risk. We detected 31 hunter and turkey contacts; increased step lengths after hunter contacts suggested fleeing behavior. The probability of a hunter-turkey contact decreased by 5.5% for every 100 m farther from a secondary road. Antipredator movement behaviors by turkeys suggest coyote risk to be low over a broad temporal window, while hunter risk is high for a narrow temporal window. We provide insight into how human-induced fear can cause antipredator behavioral responses greater than nonhuman fear, potentially causing changes in species distribution and community structure.

However, there is an increasing demand for the design and fabrication of handedness-preserving mirrors as well as chiral reflective metasurfaces with tunable spin states of reflected photons that work in a broad wavelength range in the UV and visible domain. Most chiral mirrors fabricated up to now are prepared by top-down techniques, such as e-beam lithography, which are very costly and difficult to scale up to macroscopic devices. Here, an efficient bottom-up strategy is introduced for fabricating chiral mirrors by using Layer-by-Layer assembly of oriented silver nanowire layers prepared by grazing incidence spraying on a semi-reflective silver layer. The resulting chiral metasurfaces display structure-dependent differential reflectance for circularly polarized light in a broad wavelength range in the UV, visible, and near infrared domains, reaching an extremely high figure of merit. Their differential reflectance reaches up to 95% of the maximum polarization efficiency, with the handedness of the reflected light being partially preserved. These large-area chiral mirrors with tunable chiral reflectance open perspectives in various fields, such as in optics, sensing, and chiral light-matter interactions.

However, its application is severely hindered by poor interphasic contact. Here, a new Janus interface engineering strategy is reported for the construction of continuous and flexible Bi2O3/Gd2O3 crystal nanofibrous membranes (FJNMs) with micro/nano dual self-strengthening interphasic adhesion. This strategy facilitates online micro-interlocking between Bi2O3/Gd2O3 nanofibers and in situ nano-grain fusion between Bi2O3/Gd2O3 crystals, significantly enhancing the adhesive strength at the Bi2O3/Gd2O3 interface. Additionally, the synergistic shielding effect from Bi2O3/Gd2O3 absorption and multiple reflections in Bi2O3 and Gd2O3 crystal lattices make the nanofibrous membranes a superior X-ray radiation barrier. The FJNMs demonstrate integrated features of exceptional X-ray shielding efficiency (91%-100%), robust interfacial adhesion (lap-shear strength >3.8 MPa), prominent flexibility, lightweight, and outstanding breathability.

The presence of reactive minerals within the geological CO2 sequestration target storage formation can allow reaction with injected CO2, which changes the porosity and permeability of the LF beds, affecting storage effectiveness. To investigate the effect of chemical reactions on the pore structure and permeability of sandstone cores representing the LF CO2 storage, tests were conducted to analyze the changes in porosity and permeability of sandstone cores induced by CO2-saturated brine at different reaction times (28-day maximum reaction period). Porosity and permeability of the sandstone increased after reaction with CO2-saturated brine due to mineral dissolution. The sandstone exhibited an increase in porosity and permeability after 15 days of reaction with CO2-saturated brine. Moreover, there was an increase in the volume of large pores in the sandstone after the 28-day period. The pore network of the sandstone was established through CT results, and the porosity calculated based on the obtained pore network was close to that measured in the test, demonstrating the feasibility to use CT to study the evolution of the microstructure of sandstone after long-time exposure to CO2-saturated brine.

With the increase in the availability of data in a society defined by the industrious production of data, the educational system needs to think of possibilities to bring young children closer to the world of data science. This paper presents a nontraditional data exploration experience with an 8-year-old participant helped by a data visualization tool. A task-based interview was conducted while the participant explored a carbon dioxide emission dataset. This paper studied how the participant interrogates the data, draws inferences and exhibits dispositions. At the end, some reflections are presented when introducing the exploration of nontraditional data in teaching.

J	Zhou, W; Hou, Y; Xu, SJ; Zhou, SL				Zhou, Wei; Hou, Yi; Xu, Shijun; Zhou, Shilin			An adaptive cross-scale transformer based on graph signal processing for person re-identification	IET IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						cross-scale interaction; graph signal processing; person re-identification; pure transformer model		Extracting robust feature representation is one of the key challenges for person re-identification (ReID) task. Although convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods have achieved great success, they still cannot handle the part occlusion and misalignment caused by limited receptive field. Recently, pure transformer models have shown its power in the person ReID task. However, current transformer models adopt patches of equal-scale as input, and cannot solve the problem of cross-scale interaction properly. To overcome this problem, an adaptive cross-scale transformer from a perspective of the graph signal, named ACSFormer, is proposed. Specifically, the self-attention module is first treated as an undirected fully connected graph. And then, "node variation" is introduced as an indicator to adaptively merge neighbourhood tokens. To the best of the authors' knowledge, their ACSFormer is the first work to attempt to combine pure transformers and graph signal processing in the field of person ReID. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three person ReID datasets to validate the performance of ACSFormer. Experiments demonstrate that this ACSFormer performs on par with state-of-the-art CNN-based methods and consistently improves transformer-based baseline, for example, surpassing ViT-baseline by 2.5%, 2.7% and 4.8% mAP on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17, respectively.

Large-scale heparin-based bind-and-elute chromatography identifies two biologically distinct populations of extracellular vesicles	JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES			English	Article						heparin; fibronectin; extracellular vesicles; extracellular particles; exosome; exomere	FIBRONECTIN; SULFATE; GROWTH; RNAS	Purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been challenging because EVs are heterogeneous in cargo yet share similar sizes and densities. Most surface marker-based affinity separation methods are limited to research or diagnostic scales. We report that heparin chromatography can separate purified EVs into two distinct subpopulations as ascertained by MS/MS: a non-heparin-binding (NHB) fraction that contains classical EV markers such as tetraspanins and a heparin-binding (HB) fraction enriched in fibronectins and histones. Both fractions were similarly fusogenic but induced different transcriptional responses in endothelial cells. While EVs that were purified by conventional, non-affinity methods alone induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Ki67, the NHB fraction did not. This result suggests heparin chromatography as an additional novel fractionation step that is inherently scalable, does not lead to loss of material, and separates inflammatory and pyrogenic EVs from unreactive EVs, which will improve clinical applications.

The primary study aim was to evaluate the relationship between anti-Xa and thromboelastography (TEG) reaction (R) time in patients with severe COVID-19 receiving therapeutic UFH infusions.Design: Single-center, retrospective study conducted over a 15-month period (2020-2021).Setting: Academic medical center (Banner University Medical Center Phoenix).Patients: Adult patients with severe COVID-19 administered therapeutic UFH infusions with one or more corresponding TEG, and anti-Xa assessments drawn within =2 hours of each other were included. The primary end point was the correlation between anti-Xa and TEG R time. Secondary aims were to describe the correlation between activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and TEG R time, as well as clinical outcomes. Pearson's coefficient was used to evaluate the correlation using a kappa measure of agreement.	[Buckley, Mitchell S.

J	Cakiroglu, Ü; Mumcu, S				Cakiroglu, Unal; Mumcu, Suheda			An automatic feedback model for learning programming via block-based programming platforms	COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						automatic feedback; block-based programming; teaching programming	COMPUTER; SCRATCH; SKILLS	Block-based programming platforms (BBPP) are often introduced to students for teaching programming. To facilitate students learning to program with BBPPs, students need quality feedback. However, BBPPs' feedback systems sometimes fail to support students in learning programming. In this study, a new BBPP, including a novel automatic feedback model, is created to support secondary school students in learning programming concepts and applying problem-solving strategies for problems in BBPPs better. The proposed feedback model analyses the students' blocks used in BBPPs and compares them with the correct solution by calculating the distance of the codes represented by the block patterns. Teachers' and students' initial evaluations about the BBPP were generally positive and promising. The proposed model is considered to have the potential for practical application in the design and implementation of the feedback model for BBPPs. We hope that the findings of this study will assist in the future design and implementation of feedback for BBPPs to facilitate the structural and strategic knowledge dimensions of programming.

The role of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in CAR-T-cell-treated patients remains unclear. To explore the efficacy and safety of early G-CSF administration in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) who were receiving autologous anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, we retrospectively collected and summarized clinical data to compare patients receiving G-CSF within 14 days (early G-CSF group) to patients receiving later or no G-CSF (control group) after their CART infusion. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the incidence and duration of neutropenia between the early G-CSF group and the control group (77% vs. 63%, p = 0.65; 8 vs. 4 days, p = 0.37, respectively). However, the incidence and duration of CRS were significantly higher in the early G-CSF group than in the control group (81% vs. 38%, p = 0.03; 3 vs. 0 days, p = 0.004, respectively). Moreover, early G-CSF application had no significant effect on the expansion and efficacy of CAR-T cells. In conclusion, our study suggested that early G-CSF administration did not reduce the incidence and duration of neutropenia but rather increased the incidence and duration of CRS.

Framing landscape decision-making as a governance process that requires a collective approach can encourage key stakeholders to come together to co-inform a discussion about their priorities and what constitutes good governance, leading to more holistic landscape decisions. In this paper, we recognise that a suite of complementary and multi-dimensional approaches are in practice used to inform and evaluate land use decisions. We have called these approaches `lenses' because they each provide a different perspective on the same problem. The four lenses are (i) power and market gain, (ii) ecosystem services, (iii) place-based identity and (iv) ecocentric. Each brings a different set of evidence and viewpoints (narrative, qualitative and experiential, as well as quantitative metrics such as monetary) to the decision-making process and can potentially reveal problems and solutions that others do not. Considering all lenses together allows dialogue to take place which can reveal the true complexities of landscape decision-making and can facilitate more effective and more holistic decisions. Employing the lenses requires governance structures that give equal weight to all lenses, enable dialogue and coexistence between top down and bottom-up approaches, and permit adaptation to local and granular place-specifics rather than developing "one-size-fits-all" solutions. We propose that formalising the process of balancing all the lenses requires public participation, and that a lens approach should be used to support landscape decisions alongside a checklist that facilitates transparency in the conversation, showing how all evidence has been considered and critically assessed.

However, this approach is inefficient when it comes to assessing the actual edibility of fresh products, since the events that accelerate the onset of degradation phenomena, such as a rise in temperature, cannot be continuously assessed. In this context, the detection of a different parameter, such as low concentration of amines, can reveal the onset of degradation processes. Here, a colorimetric photonic multilayer sensor is reported for detecting low amine concentrations suitable for sealed packages. The sensor consists of alternating layers of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) and polyacrylic acid, and its response is based on the selective interaction between the latter and amines. This interaction causes the polymer layers to swell and introduce disorder into the photon structure, resulting in fading its bright color. Since the reaction of these systems is usually reversible, manipulation or false readings are possible due to inapt sealing of the package. It is shown that the activation of carboxylic acid residues of the sensitive polymer with N-hydroxysuccinimide produces an irreversible response to amine vapor concentrations as low as 3 parts per billion.

Although mechanisms were proposed in previous studies, alpha,beta '-disulfide formation in ETPs is not well-determined owing to the failure to identify the hypothetical intermediate. Herein, we characterize the key ortho-quinone methide (o-QM) intermediate and prove its involvement in the carbon-sulfur migration from an alpha,alpha '- to an alpha,beta '-disulfide by elucidating pretrichodermamide A biosynthesis, which is catalyzed by a FAD-dependent thioredoxin oxygenase TdaE harboring a noncanonical CXXQ motif. Biochemical investigations of recombinant TdaE and mutants demonstrated that the construction of the alpha,beta '-disulfide was initiated by Gln140 triggering proton abstraction for generation of the essential o-QM intermediate, accompanied by beta '-acetoxy elimination. Subsequent attack on the alpha,alpha '-disulfide by Cys137 led to disulfide migration and spirofuran formation. This study expands the biocatalytic toolbox for transannular disulfide formation and sets the stage for the targeted discovery of bioactive ETPs.

This association may be attributed to the ability of many oral microbes to influence the inflammatory microenvironment. Herein, we focused our attention on the bidirectional relationship between periodontitis and type 2 diabetes using high-resolution whole metagenomic shotgun analysis to explore the composition and functional profile of the subgingival microbiome in diabetics and non-diabetics subjects with different periodontal conditions.In the present study, the abundance of metabolic pathways encoded by oral microbes was reconstructed from the metagenome, and we identified a set of dysregulated metabolic pathways significantly enriched in the periodontitis and/or diabetic patients. These pathways were mainly involved in branched and aromatic amino acids metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and adipocytokine signaling pathways, ferroptosis and iron homeostasis, nucleotide metabolism, and finally in the peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides synthesis.Overall, the results of the present study provide evidence in favor of the hypothesis that during the primary inflammatory challenge, regardless of whether it is induced by periodontitis or diabetes, endotoxemia and/or the release of inflammatory cytokines cause a change in precursor and/or in circulating innate immune cells. Dysbiosis and inflammation, also via oral-gut microbiome axis or adipose tissue, reduce the efficacy of the host immune response, while fueling inflammation and can induce that metabolic/epigenetic reprogramming of chromatin accessibility of genes related to the immune response.Moreover, the presence of an enhanced ferroptosis and an imbalance in purine/pyrimidine metabolism provides new insights into the role of ferroptotic death in this comorbidity.

PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access							METROPOLITAN-AREAS; PUBLIC-SECTOR; TAX; GOVERNMENTS; MUNICIPAL; ORGANIZATION; AUTONOMY; RELIANCE; POLICY	What happens to general-purpose local government spending for service provision when a special district enters the public service market? Theoretically, special districts can act either as complements by supplementing existing service provision spending or as substitutes by supplanting current service provision spending. We find a substitution effect using fixed effects regression on urban counties in the United States from 1972 to 2017. Special districts replace spending for public service provision by county governments; however, we find no similar result for municipal governments. But the results are nuanced-findings are confined mainly to public services that tend to cover large land areas, like fire protection, sewerage, and solid waste management. Furthermore, we find evidence that day-to-day operations drive observed substitution, and that county size is an important factor depending on the functional service area.

They transmit their signaling via binding to intracellular signal transducers and effectors, such as G proteins, GPCR kinases, and beta-arrestins. To influence specific GPCR signaling behaviors, beta-arrestins recruit effectors to form larger signaling complexes. Intriguingly, they facilitate divergent functions for the binding to different receptors. Recent studies relying on advanced structural approaches, novel biosensors and interactome analyses bring us closer to understanding how this specificity is achieved. In this article, we share our hypothesis of how active GPCRs induce specific conformational rearrangements within beta-arrestins to reveal distinct binding interfaces, enabling the recruitment of a subset of effectors to foster specialized signaling complexes. Furthermore, we discuss methods of how to comprehensively assess beta-arrestin conformational states and present the current state of research regarding the functionality of these multifaceted scaffolding proteins.

Employing in situ H-1 NMR spectroscopy, both an organocatalytic, anionic polymerization setup (system A) and a zwitterionic, Lewis pair-type approach (system B) are studied comparatively. The obtained kinetics data are fitted to the non-terminal model (Jaacks and Ideal Integrated) and terminal Mayo-Lewis model (Meyer Lowry) to determine the reactivity ratios, revealing striking differences in copolyether microstructure and achievable molar masses. While for the metal-free catalysis (system A) reactivity ratios of r(EO) = 3.4 and r(PO) = 0.30 are found, indicating a soft gradient structure, the presence of Mg(HMDS)(2) (system B) entails exclusively zwitterionic propagation. This results in enhanced selectivity, displaying corresponding parameters of r(EO) = 7.9 and r(PO) = 0.13, in line with the proposed monomer-activated mechanism. The block-like, strongly tapered copolyether microstructure is also reflected in the thermal properties, showing a melting point for the latter sample and much higher molar masses (M-n >50 000 g mol(-1)). Notably, this study not only identifies capable polymerization systems for EO/PO, but also underlines that via in situ H-1 NMR kinetics key questions regarding the polymerization mechanism can be illuminated quickly and reliably, simplifying access to essential structure-property relations.

To find the global optimum, it is desirable to screen the overall design space. Advanced model-based approaches enable to screen a broad range of the design-space, in contrast to traditional statistical or heuristic-based approaches. Though, chromatographic mechanistic modeling (MM), one of the advanced model-based approaches, can be speed-limiting for flowsheet optimization, which evaluates every purification possibility (e.g., type and order of purification techniques, and their operating conditions). Therefore, we propose to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) during global optimization to select the most optimal flowsheets. So, the number of flowsheets for final local optimization is reduced and consequently the overall optimization time. Employing ANNs during global optimization proved to reduce the number of flowsheets from 15 to only 3. From these three, one flowsheet was optimized locally and similar final results were found when using the global outcome of either the ANN or MM as starting condition. Moreover, the overall flowsheet optimization time was reduced by 50% when using ANNs during global optimization. This approach accelerates the early purification process design; moreover, it is generic, flexible, and regardless of sample material's type.

Reduced dosing versus full dosing valganciclovir for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus in high-risk abdominal transplant recipients	CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article; Early Access						cytomegalovirus; kidney transplant; prophylaxis; valganciclovir	HIGH-DOSE VALGANCICLOVIR; DISEASE; PREVENTION; INFECTION; EFFICACY; SAFETY; DONOR	BackgroundCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common infection in abdominal transplant recipients (ATR). Prevention of CMV in the highest risk population (CMV IgG donor+/recipient-) is critical as CMV is associated with negative outcomes. Guideline recommended prophylactic valganciclovir dosing is 900 mg daily for 6 months in this population. However, reduced dosing strategies are utilized in practice. MethodsThis single center, retrospective study in adult ATR compared full valganciclovir prophylactic dosing (900 mg daily for 6 months) to reduced dosing (900 mg daily for 3 months, then 450 mg daily for 3 months). The primary endpoint was incidence of CMV infection with viral load >1000 IU/mL. Secondary endpoints included incidence of CMV infection with viral load 200-1000 IU/mL, neutropenia, and leukopenia. ResultsIncidence of CMV infection with viral load >1000 IU/mL (29% vs. 27%, p = 1) or CMV infection with viral load 200-1000 IU/mL (6% vs. 12%, p = .421) did not differ significantly between 68 ATR in reduced and full dosing groups, as well as incidence of leukopenia (94% vs. 97%, p = 1) and neutropenia (77% vs. 70%, p = .586). ConclusionsThere was no difference in the incidence of CMV infection, neutropenia, or leukopenia of the two dosing regimens, although time to CMV diagnosis was different.	[Kreiser, Maura L.

MethodsA case-control study was carried out on 161 patients treated with dental implants, 80 with PI and 81 without PI, which corresponded to 91 women and 70 men, whose mean age was 60.90 years. A specific protocol was completed for the clinical and implant data. Microbiological samples were taken by oral rinse and with paper tips from the peri-implant sulcus. For the quantitative and qualitative analysis Candida Chromogenic Agar/CONDA plates were incubated for 72 h at 36 + 1 degrees C. Fungal growth was considered active when having more than 50 CFU. Specific Candida spp. cultures were later confirmed by API ID 32C and PCR. ResultsFungal growth was achieved in 28% of oral rinse and 6.75% of peri-implant fluid samples. No significant differences were recognized between study groups. Most of the cultures (>65%) showed more than 50 CFU. The most frequent species were Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. There was no association between different PI risk factors and fungal data. The presence of Candida spp. in the oral cavity of patients with dental implants was related to total edentulism and the use of implant-fixed complete prosthesis implant-retained removable prosthesis. ConclusionsThese results suggest that there is no link between PI and presence of Candida in patients with dental implants undergoing regular supportive periodontal therapy.

RC88 is a mesothelin-targeting antibody-drug conjugate for malignant solid tumor. In the preclinical study, the relationship between PKs and PDs was determined using the xenograft mouse model derived from ovarian cancer and lung cancer cell lines. A secondary parameter representing the efficacy index of the drug, termed as tumor static concentration (TSC), was calculated using the three semimechanistic PK/PD models. A mechanism-based target-mediated drug disposition model was used to predict the human PKs. TSC from mice and predicted human PK were integrated to predict human efficacy dose. Results showed that 2 cell lines were sensitive to drugs, and the predicted efficacy dose was between 0.82 and 1.96 mg/kg q1w.

The selection of antibodies has traditionally been based on their binding affinity. New techniques and advancements in combinatorial antibody libraries have made it possible to isolate functional antibodies within cellular environments. These antibodies can act an agonist or antagonist provide valuable insights into the complexities of signal transduction and potentially leading to different cell responses or affecting cell behavior. Additionally, an in vivo selection system is utilized, which relies on cell migration to specific tissues, to generate antibodies that induce cells to differentiate and selectively migrate to particular tissues. Overall, the discovery of functional antibodies from antibody libraries has the potential to reveal receptor pleiotropism and pave opportunities to investigate cellular biology and uncover surprising discoveries in the areas of stem cells and cancer research.

The experimental results show that the Dice coefficient on the test set was 80.58%, and the mean intersection over union was 81.21%. The improved U-2-Net model has the best segmentation accuracy compared with similar models, realizes the automatic segmentation of thyroid nodules, provides help for manual segmentation, and has good application prospects and clinical value.

Living conditions and (de)citizenship of adults with intellectual and complex disabilities in Portugal	JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES			English	Article; Early Access						citizenship status; human rights; living conditions; persons with intellectual and complex disabilities; Portugal		BackgroundIn 2009, Portugal ratified the UN CRPD and a turn to a rights-based approach in disability law and policy has intensified since. It thus becomes important to understand whether these legal changes are furthering the social inclusion of adults with intellectual and complex disabilities. MethodQuestionnaires were applied to a stratified sample of 127 adults with intellectual and complex disabilities attending social care and vocational training programmes across the country. ResultsParticipants reported low rates of social participation, and many (49%) were found to live below the poverty line. High rates of discrimination and violence and feelings of loneliness and sadness were also reported, which can be strong indicators of the oppression that many of them daily endure. ConclusionAdults with intellectual and complex disabilities in Portugal face exclusion, discrimination, and violence. The poverty and isolation in which many of them live compounds their (de)citizenship status in Portuguese society.

Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide widely used in crops to control weeds and could affect honeybees' health in sublethal doses. Our aim was to study how sublethal doses of glyphosate affects to oxidative stress and mitochondrial homeostasis in honeybees. We exposed honeybees to glyphosate at 5 and 10 mg center dot l(-1) for 2 and 10 h for the gene expression analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and for 48 and 72 h for the antioxidant enzymes activity and lipid peroxidation determination. We observed a general increase in antioxidant- and mitochondrial-related genes expression in honeybees after 2 h of exposition to glyphosate, as well as a rise in catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymatic activity after 48 h and an increment in lipid peroxidation adducts generation after 72 h. These results suggest a direct effect of glyphosate on honeybees' health, with an insufficient response of the antioxidant system to the generated oxidative stress, resulting in an increase in lipid peroxidation and, therefore, oxidative damage. Altogether, results obtained in this work demonstrate that sublethal treatments of glyphosate could directly affect honeybee individuals under laboratory conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate alternatives to glyphosate to determine if they are less harmful to non-target organisms.

High-resolution stable isotope profiles from shells of the land snail <i>Placostylus</i> reveal contrasting patterns between snails originating from New Zealand and New Caledonia	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Carbonate shell; Placostylus; southwest Pacific; stable isotopes; terrestrial gastropods	AMBAGIOSUS PULMONATA BULIMULIDAE; SOUTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; LANDSNAIL FAUNAS; SAN-SALVADOR; CARBON; SIGNATURES; ISLAND; ENVIRONMENT; TIME	The stable oxygen (delta O-18(shell)) and carbon (delta C-13(shell)) isotope ratios retrieved from the carbonate shell of terrestrial gastropods can be used as an environmental proxy and are thought to reflect dietary composition and ambient climatic conditions (e.g. precipitation amount, humidity, temperature). Here, we generate high-resolution isotopic profiles of nine modern land snails of the genus Placostylus, collected from two locations in New Caledonia and one location in New Zealand. We found that snails from New Zealand had, on average, higher delta O-18(shell) values than their counterparts in New Caledonia, which surprisingly runs counter to the expected relationship based on the isotopic composition of rainwater between these two regions. Specimens from New Caledonia exhibit ephemeral decreases in their delta O-18(shell) values, which could be linked to extreme precipitation events in this region, while snails from New Zealand have less variation in their delta O-18(shell) values. Snails from New Zealand had, on average, slightly higher delta C-13(shell) than their counterparts in New Caledonia, but a large difference in carbon isotopes was sometimes observed between snails collected at the same location. Most snails exhibit a temporal trend in their delta C-13(shell) values, indicating potential shifts in diet through to maturity.

However, previous research has not explained how consumers choose between these two channels and the potential moderating factors of that choice. To narrow this gap in the literature, we conducted a cognitive neuroscience-based experiment and a scenario-based experiment to investigate how the consumers' purchase intention is impacted by e-commerce sales channels (self-run vs. third-party) and review volume (low vs. high). As per the results of the experiments, the participants were more likely to buy from the self-run (vs. third-party) channel when the review volume was low; however, they did not differ in their purchase intention between the self-run and third-party channels when the review volume was high (Studies 1 and 2). The neuroscience data yielded similar findings: When the review volume was low, the self-run channel elicited more pronounced electroencephalography activity regarding the late positive potential (LPP) than the third-party channel; when the review volume was high, there was no difference in the LPP induced by the two sales channels (Study 1). In addition, the interaction effect between sales channel and review volume on purchase intention was mediated by perceived product quality (Study 2). Based on these findings, we discussed the theoretical and practical implications of the research.

Here we posit that a strategy based on repeating front-of-package images of a flavor ingredient can help solve this dilemma. Prior literature reports positive benefits in terms of purchase from displaying one or more front-of-package flavor-giving ingredient images but offers limited insights into the effect of repeating the same flavor-giving ingredient image. Based on four experiments, we found a differential effect of flavor-giving ingredient images repetition on consumption and purchase intention only when cognitive resources were available. The more flavor-giving ingredient images, the lower product consumption (Study 1), but the easier mental flavor imagery, and the stronger purchase intention (Study 2). Specifically, the increase in flavor mental imagery produced by image repetition induces sensory-specific satiety that drives more intention to purchase (Study 3). These findings are of interest for both reducing obesity due to overeating and designing front-of-package imagery.

Previously published predictive models for microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) were generally assumed patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) a homogenous population, i.e., the laboratory predictors were associated with sperm retrieval rate (SRR) in a similar way among different subpopulations. In addition, previous studies primarily regarded the success of sperm retrieval as the sole endpoint, although live birth is the ultimate goal for the couples. Objectives. The main objective is to develop and evaluate the clinical benefit of a model predicting the clinical outcome of micro-TESE in heterogeneous population with NOA. The outcome of pregnancy was taken into account via assessing the association between the predicted outcome of micro-TESE and pregnancy. Materials and Methods. A development cohort of 1,292 patients with NOA and an external validation cohort of 530 patients were included. Sperm retrieval was performed using micro-TESE. Clinical outcomes, including sperm retrieval, clinical pregnancy, and live birth, were collected. We developed a model using the machine learning method random forest and provided a web-based calculator. Results. The SRR was 38.1% (492/1,292) in the development cohort and 48.5% (257/530) in the validation cohort. The final model includes etiology, AMH, sperm retrieval surgical history, testicular volume, FSH, LH, and age as predictors (ordered by variable importance). The area under the curve of our model was 0.76 (0.74-0.79) in the development cohort and 0.75 (0.71-0.79) in the external validation cohort. The decision curve analysis showed that personalized model-based surgical decision provides additional clinical benefit. The clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) were 45.3% (405/895) and 57.6% (338/587), respectively, in the overall population. For patients of different SRR, the CPR and CLBR of whom had successful sperm retrieval were similar. Discussion and Conclusion. Our model predicting the SRR of micro-TESE was generalizable and easy to use. Predicted pregnancy outcomes like CPR and CLBR could also be derived from predicted SRR. A model-based surgical decision after personalized consultation would be beneficial to patients with NOA.

Recent advances in wearable strain sensors using nanomaterials have significantly enhanced sensor performance with regard to sensitivity, detectable range, and response time. However, it is still challenging to obtain all types of body strain information, from small vibrations to joint movements, using one type of sensor. Herein, a full-range on-body strain (FROS) sensor covering ultrasmall-to-large strains such as vocal vibration and joint movement is reported. To achieve an ultrawide detectable range, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-embedded laser-induced graphene (LIG) is synthesized by laser engraving on a graphene oxide (GO)-embedded polyimide (PI) complex film. An rGO-LIG homostructure based on sp(2)-carbons is photothermally reconstructed from the GO-PI heterostructure in a complex film by in situ co-transformation and then transferred to an elastomer substrate. The fabricated FROS sensor successfully performs on-body strain monitoring of various indicators, such as physiological pulse, vocal sound waveform, and body movement, as well as American sign language translation. Furthermore, it is believed that this rGO-LIG homostructure-based material synthesized by in situ co-transformation can potentially provide novel functionalities in fields such as wearable electronics, humanoid, soft robotics, and intelligent prosthetics.

This meta-analysis aimed to objectively explore the efficacy and safety of TKIs.Methods: Electronic databases were searched for relevant clinical trials. We conducted a pairwise meta-analysis, pooled analysis, and estimated summary survival curves to compare survival outcomes following TKIs therapy for BCBM patients using Stata version 16.0 or R x64 4.0.5.Results: Thirteen clinical trials involving 987 HER2-positive BCBM patients were analyzed. A trend of longer progression-free survival (PFS) was observed in the TKI-containing arm compared to the non-TKI-containing arm (hazard ratio = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-1.15, p = 0.132), although the difference is not statistically significant. Summary survival curves reported the summary median PFS and overall survival were 7.9 months and 12.3 months. Subgroup analysis revealed that TKIs combined with capecitabine (TKI + Cap) regimens resulted in improved survival outcomes. Tucatinib may be more effective in BCBM patients. The main grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (22%, 95% CI: 14%-32%), neutropenia (11%, 95% CI: 5%-18%), hepatic toxicity (7%, 95% CI: 1%-16%), and sensory neuropathy (6%, 95% CI: 2%-12%).Conclusion: TKIs therapy improved the survival outcomes of HER2-positive BCBM patients, especially when combined with capecitabine and tolerable AEs. We also identified the clinical value of tucatinib, which appears to be the most favorable TKI drug for BCBM patients.

Here, we synthesize a meta-analysis of the cumulative effect of human disturbances on the behaviour of global threatened terrestrial mammals. LocationGlobal terrestrial ecosystem. Time PeriodData collected from 1993 to 2021. Major Taxa StudiedTerrestrial mammals. ResultsThere were significant differences in behavioural changes among categories of human disturbances (i.e. biological invasion, climate change, grazing, habitat degradation, protection management, road traffic and tourism). The effect size of road traffic on behavioural change was the largest and particularly led habitat selection to be more specialized. The effect size for habitat degradation on foraging behaviour was the largest, and the effect mainly led to a shorter time spent in foraging and a change in food selection. Changes to behaviour increased with human disturbance intensity and varied among species according to their functional traits including body mass, food habits, migration and group type. Climate change, grazing, road traffic and tourism had a greater effect on larger species. The effect size for habitat degradation on omnivorous species was the largest, while carnivorous and solitary species were more sensitive to tourism, and migratory species were especially vulnerable to climate changes. Main ConclusionsThe diverse human disturbances interact with disturbance intensity, and some species' functional traits significantly affected the behavioural change in threatened terrestrial mammals. Such behavioural changes away from predisturbance patterns may have consequences for their fitness and community interactions. The management and conservation of threatened species should incorporate knowledge of their behavioural responses to human disturbance and take into account the potential ecological consequences for biodiversity conservation.

Nursing students' perceived stress, social support, self-efficacy, resilience, mindfulness and psychological well-being: A structural equation model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article						mindfulness; nursing student; psychological well-being; resilience; self-efficacy; social support; stress	CONNOR-DAVIDSON RESILIENCE; SCALE; HAPPINESS	Nursing students' stress, protective factors (e.g. resilience, social support, mindfulness and self-efficacy) and psychological well-being (PWB) have been well reported in the literature. However, the interactions of these variables were scarcely examined in the latter part of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the context of a developing country. This cross-sectional correlational study complying with STROBE guidelines tested a hypothetical model of the interrelationships of nursing students' stress, protective factors and PWB using structural equation modelling (SEM). Nursing students (n = 776) from five nursing schools in the Philippines were conveniently recruited from September 2022 to January 2023. Six validated self-report scales (Perceived Stress Scale, Multi-dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Psychological Wellbeing Scale) were used to collect data. SEM, mediation analyses and path analyses were used for data analysis. The emerging model demonstrated acceptable model fit parameters. Stress negatively impacted protective factors, while all the protective factors positively influenced PWB. Social support mediated the influence of stress on resilience, mindfulness and PWB. Resilience is a significant mediator of stress, self-efficacy, social support and PWB. Mindfulness mediated the influence of stress, social support and self-efficacy on PWB. Finally, self-efficacy had a mediating role between resilience and mindfulness. Nursing institutions and nurse educators can use the proposed model as their basis for empirical and theoretical evidence in creating programmes that will strengthen nursing students' protective factors, thus reducing stress while improving PWB and learning outcomes.

In other tusked animals, endodontic therapy has been reported to treat acute pulp exposure and to preserve the growing tusk. Therefore, a partial pulpectomy was attempted in the babirusa, combined with systemic antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy. Under general anaesthesia, the partial pulpectomy was performed twice, followed by a direct pulp capping with mineral trioxide aggregate and closure of the coronal pulp opening using glass ionomer cement and composite. Partial pulpectomies have been performed in babirusas before, but using mineral trioxide aggregate as pulp capping is a novel treatment regimen. It was performed without complications, and the tusk continued to grow. Over a follow-up period of 14 months, the tusk was successfully preserved in absence of any relapse or instability.

Understanding the factors involved in spread of resistance allows the formulation of strategies to slow resistance development and likewise identify solutions for the treatment of highly recalcitrant fungal infections. To investigate the recent explosion of resistant strains, a literature review was performed focusing on four main areas: mechanisms of resistance to antifungal agents, diagnosis of superficial fungal infections, management, and stewardship. The use of traditional diagnostic tools such as culture, KOH analysis and minimum inhibitory concentration values on treatment were investigated and compared to the newer techniques such as molecular methods including whole genome sequencing, and polymerase chain reaction. The management of terbinafine-resistant strains is discussed. We have emphasized the need for antifungal stewardship including increasing surveillance for resistant infection.	[Gupta, Aditya K.

In this study, the authors propose an end-to-end and simple enough coordinate-based regression (CBR) method called Dynamic Deformable Transformer (DDT) for face alignment. Unlike general pre-defined landmark queries, DDT uses Dynamic Landmark Queries (DLQs) to query landmarks' classes and coordinates together. Besides, DDT adopts a deformable attention mechanism rather than a regular attention mechanism which has a faster convergence speed and lower computational complexity. Experiment results on three mainstream datasets 300W, WFLW, and COFW demonstrate DDT exceeds the state-of-the-art CBR methods by a large margin and is comparable to the current state-of-the-art HBR methods with much less computational complexity.

J	Hayward, L; Whitworth, M; Pepin, N; Dorling, S				Hayward, Leah; Whitworth, Malcolm; Pepin, Nick; Dorling, Steve			Thunderstorm tracking in Northwest Europe for enhanced hazard preparedness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						Ireland; lightning; Northwest Europe; thunderstorm synoptics; thunderstorm tracking; thunderstorms; UK	CLIMATOLOGY	The tracking of thunderstorms provides critical information on their frequency and behaviour for early warning, prediction and preparedness. Thunderstorm tracking has previously been constrained by the boundaries of a particular country or has focused on a particular category such as severe thunderstorms and mesoscale convective systems. However, less severe thunderstorms also pose a risk to life and property and occur more frequently and thus warrant inclusion in investigations of thunderstorm behaviour. In this paper, we present a new thunderstorm event catalogue, including all detected thunderstorms with at least three lightning flashes, derived from a tracking methodology applied to Northwest Europe within the bounds of 48 degrees to 65 degrees N and 15 degrees W to 10 degrees E between 2008 and 2018. The catalogue is based on ATDnet lightning flash data which was clustered into thunderstorms using a spatio-temporal proximity assessment lightning clustering code written in the R coding language. The thunderstorm lightning clusters enabled the production of thunderstorm behaviour statistics such as speed, direction of movement, lightning flashes per minute and duration. This revealed that in winter, thunderstorms are shorter lived and move faster than in summer as well as more typically tracking from the west rather than from the south-west. Thunderstorm behaviour characteristics were attributed to weather pattern types for the first time, providing probabilistic data that can be attributed to synoptic conditions. This can improve preparedness and early warning. Such results demonstrate how this new thunderstorm event catalogue, which includes all types and severities of thunderstorms unconstrained by political boundaries, can provide additional important information to enhance understanding of thunderstorm behaviour in the region. Our lightning clustering method may be useful for similar studies in other locales.

These materials have been designed to assist anti-doping laboratories in validating their calibration method or to be employed as calibrant for stable carbon isotope measurements of Boldenone, Boldenone Metabolite 1 and Formestane. These CRMs will allow for accurate and traceable analysis in compliance with World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Technical Document TD2021IRMS. MethodsCertification was performed using an elemental analyser-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) primary reference method on the bulk carbon isotope ratios of nominally pure steroid starting materials. EA-IRMS analyses were carried out on a Flash EA Isolink CN coupled via a Conflo IV to a Delta V plus mass spectrometer. Confirmation analysis was performed by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) using a Trace 1310 GC coupled to a Delta V plus mass spectrometer via GC Isolink II. ResultsBased on the EA-IRMS analysis, the materials were certified with delta(C-13) values of -30.38 parts per thousand (Boldenone), -29.71 parts per thousand (Boldenone Metabolite 1) and 30.71 parts per thousand (Formestane). Noting that the assumption of 100% purity in the starting materials has the potential to introduce bias, this was investigated using GC-C-IRMS analysis and theoretical modelling based on purity assessment data. ConclusionsCareful application of this theoretical model was shown to provide reasonable estimates of uncertainty while avoiding the introduction of errors associated with analyte-specific fractionation during GC-C-IRMS analysis.

Associations between sporting physical activity and cognition in mid and later-life: Evidence from two cohorts	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						accelerometer; cognition; executive function; exercise; leisure activity; memory; physical activity; sporting	PERFORMANCE; VALIDITY	Evidence has linked sporting leisure time physical activity (sporting-LTPA) to healthy cognition throughout adulthood. This may be due to the physiological effects of physical activity (PA), or to other, psychosocial facets of sport. We examined associations between sporting-LTPA and cognition while adjusting for device-measured PA volume devoid of context, both in midlife (N = 4041) participants from the 1970 British Cohort Study and later-life (N = 957) participants from the British Regional Heart Study. Independent of device-measured PA, we identified positive associations between sporting-LTPA and cognition. Sports with team/partner elements were strongly positively associated with cognition, suggesting LTPA context may be critical to this relationship.	[Mitchell, J. J.; Wannamethee, G. S.; Jefferis, B.

Loss of Human Leukocyte Antigen and Immune Escape in Head and Neck Cancer	LARYNGOSCOPE			English	Article; Early Access						head and neck cancer; human leukocyte antigen; immunology	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; PROCESSING MACHINERY; HLA; EXPRESSION; RESISTANCE; MECHANISMS; BLOCKADE; DEFECTS; THERAPY	Objectives/Hypothesis: Cancer cells evade recognition by the immune system to survive. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by high levels of immune infiltration and mutation-associated neoantigens; therefore, immune evasion is likely to be an important mechanism in HNSCC tumorigenesis and progression. A commonly employed mechanism of immune evasion is downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumor cells. The objective of this study was to integrate multi-dimensional genomic and transcriptomic data from HNSCC tumors to better understand the clinical and immunologic implications of HLA LOH.Study type/Design: Cross-sectional integrated clinical and genomic analysis.Methods: Whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing data from 522 tumors profiled in The Cancer Genome Atlas HNSCC cohort were analyzed and integrated with secondary analyses including immune cell deconvolution data. Associations were analyzed with categorical hypothesis testing and multivariable logistic and Cox regression.Results: HLA LOH was a prevalent event that was identified in 53% of HNSCC tumors; in many cases, more than one class I HLA gene was targeted for LOH. HLA LOH was more common in advanced-stage tumors. Tumors with somatic HLA LOH had tumor microenvironments defined by decreased lymphocyte and T cell infiltration.Conclusions: HLA LOH is one of the most prevalent genetic alterations in HNSCC, and is associated with a cold immune microenvironment, suggesting that HLA LOH is a means of immune evasion. It may have value as a predictive biomarker or potential as a cancer cell-specific therapeutic target.	[Morris, Luc G.

Safety and efficacy of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						bleeding; chronic liver disease; heparin; outcome; thrombosis	LIVER-DISEASE; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; INTERNATIONAL-CLASSIFICATION; PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPHYLAXIS; RISK; THROMBOPROPHYLAXIS; COHORT	Background & AimsPatients with cirrhosis are considered in a haemostatic balance, though weaker than in normal subjects. In these patients, however, the use of pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains controversial. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of VTE prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of studies reporting the occurrence of bleeding and VTE events in patients with cirrhosis, and controls, undergoing VTE prophylaxis. Meta-regression analysis was conducted to further explore the determinants of heterogeneity in the study of the occurrence of either bleeding or VTE events. ResultsIn a total of 10 studies, including 5712 patients, of which 2330 undergoing VTE prophylaxis, bleeding (n = 5513) and VTE events occurred in 8.2% and 2.8% patients respectively. A total of 2963 and 3162 patients were included from low-risk of bias studies in bleeding and VTE analysis respectively: while administration of VTE prophylaxis did not seem to reduce VTE (OR = 1.07, CI 0.39-2.96, p = .89), importantly prophylaxis was not associated with increased bleeding risk (OR = 0.56, CI 0.20-1.59, p = .27). Meta-regression analysis showed that no parameter significantly influenced the heterogeneity of data regarding bleeding or VTE events. ConclusionsIn patients with cirrhosis, current evidence is insufficient to advise for or against the use of VTE prophylaxis, mainly due to lack of quality and homogeneity of available data. However, its use does not appear to be associated with a significant bleeding risk. Adequately designed studies are required to provide a measure of its overall utility.

The present study describes a novel dynamic proteomics approach for the measurement of protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in broiler chickens. MethodsChickens received a 10 g/kg oral dose of (H2O)-H-2 at day 21 of their life. Body water H-2 abundance was measured in plasma samples using a portable Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Free and protein-bound amino acids (AAs) were isolated and had their H-2 enrichment measured by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Peptide H-2 enrichment was measured by proteomics analysis of plasma and muscle samples. Albumin, fibrinogen and muscle protein FSR were calculated from GC/MS and proteomics data. ResultsAla appeared to be more enriched at the site of protein synthesis than in the AA free pools. Glu was found to be the AA closest to isotopic equilibrium between the different AA pools. Glu was used as an anchor to calculate n(AA) values necessary for chicken protein FSR calculation in dynamic proteomics studies. FSR values calculated using proteomics data and GC/MS data showed good agreement as evidenced by a Bland-Altman residual plot. ConclusionsA new dynamic proteomics approach for the measurement of broiler chicken individual protein FSR based on the administration of a single (H2O)-H-2 oral bolus has been developed and validated. The proposed approach could facilitate new immunological and nutritional studies on free-living animals.

Investigating how collagen alignment modulates cellular functions will pave the way for understanding tissue scarring and regeneration and new therapeutic strategies. However, current approaches for the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) aligned collagen matrices are low-throughput and require special devices. To overcome these limitations, a simple approach to reconstitute homogeneous 3D collagen matrices with adjustable degree of fibril alignment using 3D printed inclined surfaces is developed. By characterizing the mechanical properties of reconstituted matrices, it is found that the elastic modulus of collagen matrices is enhanced with an increase in the alignment degree. The reconstituted matrices are used to study fibroblast behavior to reveal the progression of scar formation where a gradual enhancement of collagen alignment can be observed. It is found that matrices with aligned fibrils trigger fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts via cell contractility, while collagen stiffening through a crosslinker does not. The results suggest the impact of collagen fibril organization on the regulation of fibroblast differentiation. Overall, this approach to reconstitute 3D collagen matrices with fibril alignment opens opportunities for biomimetic pathological-relevant tissue in vitro, which can be applied for other biomedical research.

Indian buyers in global markets: Quality, prices and productivity	WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article; Early Access						heterogeneous firms; import prices; input quality	FIRM-LEVEL EVIDENCE; IMPORTED INTERMEDIATE INPUTS; NETWORKS; TRADE	This paper adds to the new literature on firms' direct sourcing of imported intermediate inputs. We address key gaps in the literature by examining the influence of source country characteristics on import prices, the import behaviour of Indian firms and empirical strategies to address source country selection bias, while using disaggregated import data at the firm, product and source country level. We offer a theoretical contribution which suggests that source characteristics affect firms' willingness to pay for imported inputs, particularly high-quality differentiated inputs. Our unique and detailed data set of Indian manufacturers' imported inputs allows us to control for all firm and product characteristics to eliminate missing-variable bias with fixed effects, and to correct for possible selection bias in firms' source country choices. Results indicate that source country characteristics matter. Import prices rise for products sourced from high-income per capita countries, rise with distance and fall with GDP and remoteness (the latter a new finding suggested by our theory). High productivity firms that also export appear particularly willing to pay high prices for high-quality inputs from specific source countries. Our results suggest that, apart from other consequences, restrictions on imported inputs harm firms' ability to upgrade product quality.

MethodsA multi-site, transdiagnostic sample of 355 adolescents with EDs completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and their parents completed the PEDE-Q. ResultsThe internal consistencies of the PEDE-Q subscales were on par with established EDE-Q ranges (.73 to .90), both when examined using the original four-factor EDE-Q subscales and the seven-item, three-factor subscales of the brief EDE-Q. Statistically significant medium- to large-sized correlations and poor to moderate levels of agreement were found between the corresponding EDE-Q and PEDE-Q subscales. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the PEDE-Q had a statistically significant area under the curve (AUC) to maximize sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing full-syndrome AN, whereas the EDE-Q did not. Based on chi-square analyses, the PEDE-Q identified a statistically significantly greater number of AN cases than the EDE-Q. The EDE-Q yielded a BN diagnosis more frequently than the PEDE-Q, although this difference was not statistically significant. DiscussionResults suggest that the PEDE-Q has good psychometric properties and provides incremental information that can aid in the assessment and diagnosis of adolescents with EDs, particularly those with AN. Public significanceThere exist complex challenges to identifying clinically significant eating disorders among youth. The PEDE-Q is a questionnaire measure that improves eating disorder assessment among children and adolescents by asking parents to report on the symptoms and behaviors they have observed in their child and that youth may not fully disclose. The PEDE-Q can aid in the diagnosis of adolescents with eating disorders, particularly those with anorexia nervosa.

Hence, this study aims to re-investigate the relationship between economic growth, renewable energy use, and CO2 emissions in Algeria from 1990 to 2018. Motivated by the mixed findings of the existing literature, which ignore the Fourier function and bootstrap test and apply the newly developed Fourier bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag model (FARDL). Our findings indicate that renewable energy use and growth have a long-run relationship with CO2 emissions and do not accept the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for CO2 emissions in Algeria. In the long term, the results show that renewable energy use has a negative and significant impact, and growth has a positive and statistically significant effect on CO2 emissions. In the short run, the findings indicate that renewable energy use reduces CO2 emissions, while both the growth and squared growth had positive and statistically insignificant impacts on CO2 emissions, confirming the lack of evidence supporting the EKC hypothesis. Moreover, the causality test indicates a one-way causation from growth to renewable energy use, confirming the conservation hypothesis for Algeria and from growth to CO2 emissions. Interestingly, we found one-way causality from CO2 emissions to renewable energy use, attributing this to the fact that renewable energy usage has yet to reach a point that it can significantly cause a CO2 emissions reduction. Based on the results, we recommend that policymakers design appropriate policies to decarbonize energy consumption, e.g., increasing fossil fuel costs and implementing a carbon tax. In contrast, Algeria should promote new CO2 emission-reducing technologies without affecting economic growth, e.g., tax exemptions and reductions for enterprise owners in the renewable energy industry.

Extensive research conducted in human and model systems has provided evidence that those processes are disturbed with female aging. In fact, advanced maternal age (AMA) is associated with a lower chance of pregnancy and live birth, explained by the age-related decline in oocyte quality/competence. This decline has largely been attributed to mitochondria, essential for oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo development; with mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress, responsible for nuclear and mitochondrial damage, suboptimal intracellular energy levels, calcium disturbance, and meiotic spindle alterations, that may result in oocyte aneuploidy. Nuclear-related mechanisms that justify increased oocyte aneuploidy include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, loss of chromosomal cohesion, spindle assembly checkpoint dysfunction, meiotic recombination errors, and telomere attrition. On the other hand, age-dependent cytoplasmic maturation failure is related to mitochondrial dysfunction, altered mitochondrial biogenesis, altered mitochondrial morphology, distribution, activity, and dynamics, dysmorphic smooth endoplasmic reticulum and calcium disturbance, and alterations in the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, reproductive somatic cells also experience the effects of aging, including mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage, compromising the crosstalk between granulosa/cumulus cells and oocytes, also affected by a loss of gap junctions. Old oocytes seem therefore to mature in an altered microenvironment, with changes in metabolites, ribonucleic acid (RNA), proteins, and lipids. Overall, understanding the mechanisms implicated in the loss of oocyte quality will allow the establishment of emerging biomarkers and potential therapeutic anti-aging strategies.This article is categorized under:Reproductive System Diseases > Molecular and Cellular Physiology	[Ferreira, Ana Filipa; Almeida-Santos, Teresa; Sousa, Ana Paula] Ctr Hosp & Univ Coimbra, Reprod Med Unit, P-3004561 Coimbra, Portugal; [Ferreira, Ana Filipa; Almeida-Santos, Teresa] Univ Coimbra, Fac Med, Coimbra, Portugal; [Ferreira, Ana Filipa; Soares, Maria; Almeida-Santos, Teresa; Ramalho-Santos, Joao] Univ Coimbra, CNC Ctr Neurosci & Cell Biol, CIBB, Coimbra, Portugal; [Soares, Maria] Univ Coimbra, Inst Interdisciplinary Res IIIUC, PhD Programme Expt Biol & Biomed PDBEB, Coimbra, Portugal; [Ramalho-Santos, Joao] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, Coimbra, Portugal	Universidade de Coimbra; Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra (CHUC); Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra	Sousa, AP (corresponding author), Ctr Hosp & Univ Coimbra, Reprod Med Unit, P-3004561 Coimbra, Portugal.	apmsousa@ci.uc.pt	Almeida Santos, Teresa/M-7830-2016; Ramalho-Santos, João/F-8641-2012	Almeida Santos, Teresa/0000-0001-7423-2996; Ramalho-Santos, João/0000-0002-1172-4018; Sousa, Ana Paula/0000-0002-4190-6138	Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia [2020.06180.BD, CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-000012-HealthyAging2020, UID/NEU/04539/2019]	Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))	Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Numbers: 2020.06180.BD, CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-000012-HealthyAging2020, UID/NEU/04539/2019		261	0	0	9	9	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2692-9368			WIRES MECH DIS	WIREs Mech.

It interprets the pathophysiological state of the subject by quantitatively describing the dynamic changes of metabolites through analytical methods, mainly mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a method used to manipulate sperm, oocytes, and embryos to achieve conception. Recently, several studies have reported that metabolomics methods can be used to measure metabolites in ART samples; these metabolites can be used to evaluate the quality of gametes and embryos. This article reviews the progress of research on metabolomics and the application of this technology in the field of ART, thus providing a reference for research and development directions in the future.

Evidence from a large, urban/peri-urban cohort	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						air pollution; emergency department; pediatrics; sickle cell disease; vaso-occlusive events	RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; ADOLESCENTS; REGRESSION; EXPOSURE; QUALITY	IntroductionPathophysiologic pathways of sickle cell disease (SCD) and air pollution involve inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial damage. It is therefore plausible that children with SCD are especially prone to air pollution's harmful effects. MethodsPatient data were collected from a single-center, urban/peri-urban cohort of children with confirmed SCD. Daily ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5) were collected via satellite-derived remote-sensing technology, and carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone from local monitoring stations. We used multivariable regression to quantify associations of pollutant levels and daily counts of emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for weather and time trends. For comparison, we quantified the associations of pollutant levels with daily all-patient (non-SCD) ED visits to our center. ResultsFrom 2010 to 2018, there were 17,731 ED visits by 1740 children with SCD (64.8% HbSS/HbS beta(0)). Vaso-occlusive events (57.8%), respiratory illness (17.1%), and fever (16.1%) were the most common visit diagnoses. Higher 3-day (lags 0-2) rolling mean PM2.5 and CO levels were associated with daily ED visits among those with SCD (PM2.5 incident rate ratio [IRR] 1.051 [95% confidence interval: 1.010-1.094] per 9.4 mu g/m(3) increase; CO 1.088 [1.045-1.132] per 0.5 ppm). NO2 showed positive associations in secondary analyses; ozone levels were not associated with ED visits. The comparison, all-patient ED visit analyses showed lower IRR for all pollutants. ConclusionsOur results suggest short-term air pollution levels as triggers for SCD events and that children with SCD may be more vulnerable to air pollution than those without SCD. Targeted pollution-avoidance strategies could have significant clinical benefits in this population.

J	Grant, D				Grant, Don			Sociological contributions to the study of social innovation: A critical review	SOCIOLOGY COMPASS			English	Review						institutions; networks; organizations; social entrepreneurship; social innovation; social movements; sociology	INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; ORGANIZATION; ISOMORPHISM; RESISTANCE; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS; FIELDS; LOGICS; WORK	Sociology has long been interested in innovating solutions to social problems. However, this desire has also been a source of controversy as it can conflict with the discipline's ambition also to be recognized as a hard science. This paper critically reviews sociological contributions to the study of social innovation. It first contextualizes these contributions by discussing the origins of sociology's interest in transforming society, the growing tension between that interest and sociology's other aspiration to create objective knowledge about the social world, and how more sociologists have relocated to business schools where most research on social innovation is now being conducted. Next, it summarizes sociologists' contributions, which emphasize how social innovation is organized by institutions, networks, social movements, and organizations themselves. It then discusses criticisms of this work and responses to these critiques. It concludes by asking whether sociologists' research on social innovation has advanced their discipline's dual mission of reforming and explaining society and what additional studies are needed.

This study examined the prevalence of obesity, physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and sleep among young children from a district town in northern Bangladesh and identified factors associated with unhealthy weight status. MethodsPopulation-based cross-sectional study involving all kindergarten schools in Jamalpur District town. Schools and children aged 4-7 years were randomly selected and had their weight and height measured. Mothers completed a questionnaire on their child's PA, recreational screen time, and sleep and sociodemographic factors. Children's weight status was based on World Health Organization (WHO) categories. Meeting the PA recommendation was based on the WHO guidelines for children and adolescents, and meeting the sedentary behavior and sleep recommendations was based on the Canadian/Australian 24-hour movement guidelines for children and young people. ResultsA total of 585 children and their parents were included in the study. Overall, 15% of children were overweight or obese. Three-quarters of children met the sleep guideline, and 50% met the PA guideline. Less than one third of children (31%) met the recreational screen time guideline, whereas 15% met all three guidelines. However, when adjusted for all predictors in the model, maternal education, family income, and child's age were significantly associated with overweight/obesity. Children with higher maternal education level were 2.3 times (AOR = 2.33, 95% CI: 1.19-4.78) more likely to be overweight/obese. Children in families with a higher monthly income had 1.9 times (AOR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.35) higher risk of being overweight/obese. ConclusionsPrioritizing maternal education (mother-centric interventions) can help address the high levels of childhood obesity in Bangladesh.

First, an overview of basic concepts including secondary electron emission, electron kinetics under the force law, multipactor susceptibility, and saturation mechanisms is provided, followed by a discussion on multipactor mitigation strategies. These strategies are categorised into two broad areas - mitigation by engineered devices and engineered radio frequency (rf) fields. Each approach is useful in different applications. Recent advances in multipactor physics and engineering during the past decade, such as novel multipactor prediction methods, understanding space charge effects, schemes for controlling multipacting particle trajectories, frequency domain analysis, high frequency effects, and impact on rf signal quality are presented. In addition to vacuum electron multipaction, multipactor-induced ionization breakdown is also reviewed, and the recent advances are summarised.

Our results show that while religious homogamy has a positive relationship with marital satisfaction among Protestants and Catholics, there is no such association among Buddhists. This study also reveals that higher levels of religious attendance intensify the positive relationship between religious homogamy and marital satisfaction only among Protestants. Moreover, religious heterogamy is positively associated with marital relationships among religious nones compared to religious homogamy. However, this pattern held only for religious nones who married Buddhists or Catholics. We discuss the implications of our findings for research on religion and marriage from cross-cultural perspectives.

Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan using a random-effect model. Narrative synthesis was performed for studies where results could not be pooled statistically.Results: Ten RCTs were included in the review. Results suggested that right frontal parietal and left inferior temporal gyrus of the brain showed increased cortical thickness after receiving MBIs. There were significant interaction effects for global efficiency and significant interactions in the insular and gyrus regions. Functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex and left hippocampus were increased in participants undergoing MBIs. Nevertheless, meta-analysis showed non-significant pooled effects, favouring control groups on anxiety, depression, attention, memory and global cognition.Conclusion: This review suggested the potential effects of MBIs in improving cortical thickness and connectivity in regions associated with memory and attention. Nevertheless, the effects of MBIs compared to active control groups on depression, anxiety, attention, memory and global cognition are inconclusive due to the lack of studies and non-significant results.Impact: The review advocates for more rigorous studies with larger sample size and utilizing wait-list controls to evaluate the effects of MBIs. MBIs can be considered as an adjunct with other therapies to further enhance the effect on psychological and cognitive outcomes for older adults with MCI.No Patient or Public Contribution as this is a meta-analysis.

We aimed to develop this and compare with existing HF risk scores. Methods and resultsParticipants in the third wave (2006-08) of the population-based Trondelag Health Study 3 (HUNT3) were included if they reported no previous HF. Any hospital diagnoses captured during follow-up (until the end of 2018) of HF, cardiomyopathy, or hypertensive heart disease were assessed by an experienced cardiologist. Valid HF events were defined as symptoms/signs of HF and objective evidence of structural/functional abnormality of the heart at rest. The model was compared with slightly modified HF risk scores (the Health Aging and Body Composition HF risk score, the Framingham HF risk score, the Pooled Cohort equations to Prevent HF risk score, and NORRISK 2). Among 36 511 participants (mean +/- SD age of 57.9 +/- 13.3 years, 55.4% female), with a mean follow-up of 10.2 +/- 1.3 years, 1366 developed HF (incidence rate of 3.66 per 1000 participant years). Out of the 38 relevant clinical variables assessed, we identified 12 (atrial fibrillation being the strongest) that independently predicted an HF event. The final model demonstrated good discrimination (C statistics = 0.904) and calibration, was stable in internal validation, and performed well compared with existing risk scores. The model identified that, at enrolment, 31 391 (86%), 2386 (7%), 1246 (3%), and 1488 (4%) had low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and high 10-year HF risk, respectively. ConclusionsTwelve clinical variables independently predicted 10-year HF risk. The model may serve well as the foundation of a practical, online risk score for HF in general practice.Trial Registration: Identifier: NCT04648852.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has shown considerable promise as a mitochondrial rescue agent across a range of preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of PD. ObjectivesTo investigate the safety and tolerability of high-dose UDCA in PD and determine midbrain target engagement. MethodsThe UP (UDCA in PD) study was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of UDCA (30 mg/kg daily, 2:1 randomization UDCA vs. placebo) in 30 participants with PD for 48 weeks. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31-MRS) to explore target engagement of UDCA in PD midbrain and assessment of motor progression, applying both the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (MDS-UPDRS-III) and objective, motion sensor-based quantification of gait impairment. ResultsUDCA was safe and well tolerated, and only mild transient gastrointestinal adverse events were more frequent in the UDCA treatment group. Midbrain P-31-MRS demonstrated an increase in both Gibbs free energy and inorganic phosphate levels in the UDCA treatment group compared to placebo, reflecting improved ATP hydrolysis. Sensor-based gait analysis indicated a possible improvement of cadence (steps per minute) and other gait parameters in the UDCA group compared to placebo. In contrast, subjective assessment applying the MDS-UPDRS-III failed to detect a difference between treatment groups. ConclusionsHigh-dose UDCA is safe and well tolerated in early PD. Larger trials are needed to further evaluate the disease-modifying effect of UDCA in PD. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Bruxism is defined as a masticatory muscle activity characterized by repetitive or sustained tooth contact, or by bracing or thrusting of the mandible. A smartphone application to report awake bruxism (AB) has been developed and translated into more than 25 languages. Objective(s)To translate the application into Swedish, adapt it to Swedish culture and conduct a study to evaluate the usability of the application for studies on family history and associated risk factors. MethodsTranslation and cultural adaption of the Swedish version of the application (BruxApp) was carried out in a four-step sequential process. Ten young adults (22-30 years) were recruited together with ten parents (42-67 years) and reported their AB with the application over two seven-day periods. Pain, stress and parafunctional behaviours were assessed by questionnaires. ResultsThe back translation check showed minimal discrepancies between the translation and the English version. Participants did not report any problems with the application. Response rates for both groups were 65%. A difference in frequency of AB was shown between young adults and parents (22.0% vs. 12.5%, p < .001). A positive moderate correlation was found between AB and stress (r = 0.54, p = .017). ConclusionThe use of application strategies enables data collection on AB which can be used in both clinical and research settings. The results suggest that the Swedish version is ready for implementation and for studies on the relationships between AB, family history and psychosocial factors.

Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from Cox regression models. The dose-response relationship was explored using restricted cubic splines. A separate survival analysis was conducted for 12 595 patients with incident COPD.Results: Over a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 12 595 cases of COPD were documented. Compared with the reference group, those with prediabetes and diabetes were associated with an 18% (HR 1.18 [95% CI: 1.13-1.24]) and 35% (HR 1.35 [95% CI: 1.24-1.47]) higher risk of COPD, respectively. Diabetes duration was associated with COPD risk, with multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of 1.23 (1.05-1.44), 1.20 (1.04-1.39) and 1.18 (1.01-1.37) for diabetes duration of 7 years or longer, 3 to less than 7 years, and 1 to less than 3 years versus less than 1 year, respectively. Dose-response analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between diabetes duration and COPD risk. Regarding COPD survival, COPD patients with prediabetes and diabetes had a 9% (HR 1.09 [95% CI: 1.00-1.19]) and 21% (HR 1.21 [95% CI: 1.05-1.41]) higher risk of overall death, respectively. Compared with the cases with a diabetes duration of less than 1 year, those with a diabetes duration of 7 years or longer were associated with a 46% higher risk of overall death (HR 1.46 [95% CI: 1.11-1.92]).Conclusions: Our findings indicate that diabetes, prediabetes and a longer diabetes duration are associated with a higher risk of and worse survival for COPD. Future studies are warranted to determine the optimal way of diabetes control that might reduce COPD risk.

The usefulness of CanAssist Breast over Ki67 in breast cancer recurrence risk assessment	CANCER MEDICINE			English	Article						CanAssist breast; IKWG; intermediate Ki67	ADJUVANT SYSTEMIC THERAPY; INTERNATIONAL KI67; AMERICAN SOCIETY; GUIDE DECISIONS; BIOMARKERS; RECEPTOR; WOMEN; VALIDATION; INDEX; KI-67	Background: Assessment of Ki67 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has limited utility in clinical practice owing to analytical validity issues. According to International Ki67 Working Group (IKWG) guidelines, treatment should be guided by a prognostic test in patients expressing intermediate Ki67 range, >5%-<30%. The objective of the study is to compare the prognostic performance of CanAssist Breast (CAB) with that of Ki67 across various Ki67 prognostic groups.Methods: The cohort had 1701 patients. Various risk groups were compared for the distant relapse-free interval (DRFi) derived from Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. As per IKWG, patients are categorized into three risk groups: low-risk (<5%), intermediate risk (>5%-<30%), and high-risk (>30%). CAB generates two risk groups, low and high risk based on a predefined cutoff.Results: In the total cohort, 76% of the patients were low risk (LR) by CAB as against 46% by Ki67 with a similar DRFi of 94%. In the node-negative sub-cohort, 87% were LR by CAB with a DRFi of 97% against 49% by Ki67 with a DRFi of 96%. In subgroups of patients with T1 or N1 or G2 tumors, Ki67-based risk stratification was not significant while it was significant by CAB. In the intermediate Ki67 (>5%-<30%) category up to 89% (N0 sub-cohort) were LR by CAB and the percentage of LR patients was 25% (p < 0.0001) higher compared to NPI or mAOL. In the low Ki67 (=5%) group, up to 19% were segregated as high-risk by CAB with 86% DRFi suggesting the requirement of chemotherapy in these low Ki67 patients.Conclusion: CAB provided superior prognostic information in various Ki67 subgroups, especially in the intermediate Ki67 group.

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						climate; political parties; Western Europe; public opinion; comparative politics	POLICY SHIFTS; ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES; ISSUE COMPETITION; SPATIAL THEORY; RADICAL RIGHT; GREEN; OWNERSHIP; ELECTIONS; POPULISM; IMPACT	Global warming is not only a serious threat for humanity but increasingly structures political competition in Western Europe. The rise of green (niche) parties and public awareness of the issue pressure mainstream parties to emphasise climate protection. Yet, while scholars reflect on the factors influencing mainstream parties' environmental agendas, we know little about what triggers climate standpoints and about the role public opinion plays in this process. This study measures the salience of climate protection in 292 election manifestos of mainstream parties in 10 Western European countries since the 1990s and estimates the impact of different factors on their climate agenda using OLS regressions. The findings suggest that green parties are not the driving factor, and that it is the public salience of environmental issues and pressure from the Fridays for Future movement influencing mainstream parties' agendas. Accordingly, mainstream parties seem to be responsive to public opinion pressure adopting climate protection stances. The study further proposes a different measure of niche party success than that used in previous studies.

To improve the understanding of how these polymers' molecular structure and chemical composition affect their coating mechanisms and resulting coating properties, herein three mussel-inspired polymers are developed: dendritic polyglycerol with 40% catechol groups and 60% amines (dPG40), linear polyglycerol with 80% catechols and 20% amines (lPG80), and finally lPG40 with 40% catechols and 60% amines. After a series of characterizations, it is found that chemical surface modification with a monolayer coating can be easily achieved with lPG40, and that robust and well-defined nano- to micro-structural surface coatings are possible with lPG80 and dPG40. Tunable properties are found to include not only coating speed, but coating thickness, roughness, and surficial topography. This diverse suite of controllable attributes enables mussel-inspired polyglycerol (MiPG) coatings to satisfy a wide-range of applications on multiple materials.

Hence, we conducted a systematic scoping review regarding the consequences for survivors of rape during genocide. Searches conducted in PubMed, Global Health, Scopus, PyscInfo, and Embase produced a total of 783 articles. After completing the screening process, 34 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. The included articles focus on survivors from six different genocides, with most focusing on either the genocide of the Tutsis in Rwanda or the Yazidis in Iraq. The study findings consistently show that survivors deal with stigmatization as well as a lack of both financial and psychological social support. This lack of support is partly due to social ostracization and shame but is also attributed to the fact that many survivors' families and other providers of social support were murdered during the violence. Many survivors, particularly young girls, reported dealing with intense forms of trauma both as a direct result of sexual violence and due to witnessing the death of their community members during the period of genocide. A notable proportion of survivors became pregnant from genocidal rape and contracted HIV. Group therapy was shown to improve mental health outcomes across numerous studies. These findings have important implications and can inform recovery process efforts. Psychosocial supports, stigma reduction campaigns, community reestablishment, and financial assistance are integral in facilitating recovery. These findings can also play an important role in shaping refugee support programs.

Four Donor-Acceptor (D-A) polymers, named PTDPPSe, PTDPPTT, PTDPPBT, and PTDPPTVT, are synthesized using selenophene (Se), thienothiophene (TT), bithiophene (BT), and thienylenevinylenethiophene (TVT) as the donors and siloxane side chain modified diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as acceptor. The influences of the donor structure on the polymer energy level, film morphology, molecular stacking, carrier transport properties, and tensile properties are all examined. The films of PTDPPSe show the best stretchability with crack-onset-strain greater than 100%, but the worst electrical properties with a mobility of only 0.54 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The replacement of the Se donor with larger conjugated donors, that is, TT, BT, and TVT, significantly improves the mobility of conjugated polymers but also leads to reduced stretchability. Remarkably, PTDPPBT exhibits moderate stretchability with crack-onset-strain approximate to 50% and excellent electrical properties. At 50% strain, it has a mobility of 2.37 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) parallel to the stretched direction, which is higher than the mobility of most stretchable conjugated polymers in this stretching state.

The main instruments of local government competition, involving taxation, government spending and attracting investment, are considered as well as the institutional context. Following the "performance-output-performance" to clarify the role of local government competition and environmental regulation on GDE, it is found that fiscal spending competition increases GDE, while tax and capital attraction competition play the opposite role; performance promoted inter-governmental competition makes local governments' strategic choices between economic catch-up and environmental protection volatile, and this volatility brings about fluctuations and losses in GDE. The study by regions finds that government competition and environmental regulation have a greater impact on GDE in the eastern and developed regions, while the impact on other regions is relatively small. Further, the mechanism setting and institutional improvement of environmental governance achieved significant results after 2013, but the function of local government competition mechanisms in improving environmental quality has not yet emerged in China. The findings based on the heterogeneity of regional economic development and path mechanisms provide a reference for social planners to carry out top-level design in taxation, fiscal spending, and investment attraction, as well as to formulate differentiated regional environmental regulation policies.

Meanwhile, few studies focus on enhancing the service life of tribo-materials, especially from an anti-friction perspective during dry operation. Herein, for the first time, a surface-textured film with self-lubricating property is introduced into the SF-TENG as a tribo-material, which is obtained by the self-assembly of hollow SiO2 microspheres (HSMs) close to a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface under vacuum conditions. The PDMS/HSMs film with micro-bump topography simultaneously reduces the dynamic coefficient of friction from 1.403 to 0.195 and increases the electrical output of SF-TENG by an order of magnitude. Subsequently, a textured film and self-adapting contact synergized bidirectional rotary TENG (TAB-TENG) is developed, and the superiorities of the soft flat rotator with bidirectional reciprocating rotation are systematically investigated. The obtained TAB-TENG exhibits a remarkable output stability and an outstanding mechanical durability over 350 000 cycles. Furthermore, a smart foot system for stepping energy harvesting and wireless walking states monitoring is realized. This study proposes a pioneering strategy for extending the lifetime of SF-TENGs and advances it toward practical wearable applications.

Island raptors are relatively threatened species that rely on simplified food webs and usually co-occur with invasive species. Here, we studied a population of Striated Caracara Phalcoboenus australis in Isla de los Estados (Argentina) to understand the relative contribution of food availability, topographical features and territoriality to breeding parameters. Caracaras in the area depend on the short seasonal (i.e. pulsed) availability of seabirds for feeding their chicks. On the other hand, the recent introduction of non-native ungulates may have led to a suboptimal breeding environment by reducing Caracara nest-site availability within the seabird colonies via disturbance of the grassland. Using data from seven breeding seasons we analyse the abundance, the proportion of breeding individuals, the spatial structure of breeding events and the population-level breeding performance, including chick sex ratio, to study whether the breeding ecology of this species is still shaped by marine food web pulses or could be associated with invasive herbivore disturbance. The breeding adults represented only 6-15% of the population. The spatial pattern of nest-sites did not differ from random arrangement after considering the heterogeneous distribution of food availability. Territory identity accounted for most of the variation in clutch size and productivity, and penguin availability explained part of the variability in territory occupancy and hatching rate. The chick sex ratio was biased towards females and varied according to brood size, with the more productive territories producing 91% of males. The breeding cycle of this population is still mainly dependent upon the Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes chrysocome food pulse and presents mixed evidence of being disrupted by invasive herbivores. The studied factors contributed differentially to the output of each reproductive stage, with territory identity accounting for most of the variation. Our results suggest that individual-level, long-term data could be relevant to understanding the dynamics of this species in the Fuegian archipelago, and thus a broad-scale research programme is warranted to assess the conservation status and propose future management scenarios for this species.

The pathogenesis of PEO remains unclear, although T helper (Th) 2 and Th22 cells may play an important role. Dupilumab is an interleukin (IL)-4 receptor a-antagonist that effectively reduces Th2 responses, which has drawn increasing attention in the treatment of PEO patients. Here, we reported a successful case of dupilumab treatment in combination with ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation therapy, which is well known and effective for chronic itch. The patient had a significant decrease in visual analogue scale (VAS) score and eosinophil after only 1 week of treatment, which may be due to the combination effect.

It does so in order to resituate Atkins's work within the history of scientific visualization and to contribute to the increasing complexity scholars of visual culture and of the scientific image have added to prevailing accounts of the rise of the "objective" scientific image in the nineteenth-century. Building on the work of historians of photography, art, science, and literature, it argues that her cyanotypes point toward an alternative history of scientific image as a form of craft and collection that resonates with recent calls in the study of the scientific image and scientific practices to move "beyond representation."

ObjectivesThis study investigated the perceived and performed eHealth literacy of medical sciences students, as well as the relationships between those literacies. MethodsThis study enrolled 228 medical sciences students (convenience sample) in Iran. The study tools include the eHEALS literacy scale for the perceived eHealth literacy and a questionnaire designed by the authors to assess performed eHealth literacy (skills around access, understanding, appraising, applying, and generating information). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation coefficient. ResultsIn general, over 70% of students perceived their skills of access and appraisal as good/very good, correlating with their estimated performance. Students perceived they were less confident in some appraisal skills (e.g., using information from the Internet to make health decisions) than others. Performed skills in information generation were mostly poor or very good; performed application skills generally good/very good. ConclusionsThe eHEALS score scales with actual skills (access and appraisal). Support is necessary for students in particular types of appraisal skills.

Among the vascular tissues, the phloem is particularly intriguing because of its complex functionality. In angiosperms, its principal components are the sieve elements, which transport phloem sap, and their neighboring companion cells. Together, they form a functional unit that sustains sap loading, transport, and unloading. The developmental trajectory of sieve elements is unique among plant cell types because it entails selective organelle degradation including enucleation. Meticulous analyses of primary, so-called protophloem in the Arabidopsis thaliana root meristem have revealed key steps in protophloem sieve element formation at single-cell resolution. A transcription factor cascade connects specification with differentiation and also orchestrates phloem pole patterning via noncell-autonomous action of sieve element-derived effectors. Reminiscent of vascular tissue patterning in secondary growth, these involve receptor kinase pathways, whose antagonists guide the progression of sieve element differentiation. Receptor kinase pathways may also safeguard phloem formation by maintaining the developmental plasticity of neighboring cell files. Our current understanding of protophloem development in the A. thaliana root has reached sufficient detail to instruct molecular-level investigation of phloem formation in other organs.

Through perceptual learning, we can enhance our capacities for perceptual discrimination, categorization, and attention to salient properties. We can also encode harmful biases and stereotypes. This article reviews interdisciplinary research on perceptual learning, with an emphasis on the implications for our rational and normative theorizing. Perceptual learning raises the possibility that our inquiries into topics such as epistemic justification, aesthetic criticism, and moral knowledge should include not only an examination of cognition but also of perception.

Herein, epichlorohydrin functionalized by three different cations (piperidine cation, imidazole cation and trimethylammonium cation) are respectively used to modify polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to prepare a series of PVA based AEMs, and the AEMs are cross-linked by p-phthalaldehyde. H-1 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy confirm the successful functionalization of epichlorohydrin and the successful preparation of the AEMs. The ion exchange capacity, water uptake, swelling ratio, mechanical properties, thermal stability, OH- conductivity, morphology and alkaline stability of the AEMs are assessed and compared. The experimental results suggest that the AEM modified by piperidine cation owns continuous ion channels and obvious microphase separation structure, resulting in an OH- conductivity of 94.13 mS cm(-1) at 80(circle)C. And its alkali resistance is also relatively good (87.16%, 360 h). Besides, crosslinking by p-phthalaldehyde effectively lowers the swelling ratio, increases the thermal stability and improves the mechanical properties of the AEMs.	[Jiang, Ying; Shen, Chunhui; Chen, Junjie; Lu, Hao; Guo, Yichuan; Gao, Shanjun] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Shen, Chunhui] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China	Wuhan University of Technology; Wuhan University of Technology	Shen, CH (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.	shenchunhui@whut.edu.cn		Shen, Chunhui/0000-0001-7303-1578	National Natural Science Foundation of China [21875176]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 21875176).		47	0	0	13	13	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0021-8995	1097-4628		J APPL POLYM SCI	J.

Explaining biodiversity requires an understanding of how species richness and environment covary across scales. Here, we identify scales and locations at which biodiversity is generated and correlates with environment. Location: Full latitudinal range per continent. Time Period: Present day. Major Taxa Studied: Terrestrial vertebrates: all mammals, carnivorans, bats, songbirds, hummingbirds, amphibians. Methods: We describe the use of wavelet power spectra, cross-power and coherence for identifying scale-dependent trends across Earth's surface. Spectra reveal scale-and location-dependent coherence between species richness and topography (E), mean annual precipitation (Pn), temperature (Tm) and annual temperature range (Delta T). Results: >97% of species richness of taxa studied is generated at large scales, that is, wavelengths. 103 km, with 30%-69% generated at scales greater than or similar to 10(4) km. At these scales, richness tends to be highly coherent and anti-correlated with E and T, and positively correlated with Pn and Tm. Coherence between carnivoran richness and Delta T is low across scales, implying insensitivity to seasonal temperature variations. Conversely, amphibian richness is strongly anti-correlated with Delta T at large scales. At scales greater than or similar to 10(3) km, examined taxa, except carnivorans, show highest richness within the tropics Terrestrial plateaux exhibit high coherence between carnivorans and E at scales similar to 10(3) km, consistent with contribution of large-scale tectonic processes to biodiversity. Results are similar across different continents and for global latitudinal averages. Spectral admittance permits derivation of rules--of-thumb relating long-wavelength environmental and species richness trends. Main Conclusions: Sensitivities of mammal, bird and amphibian populations to environment are highly scale dependent. At large scales, carnivoran richness is largely independent of temperature and precipitation, whereas amphibian richness correlates	[O'Malley, Conor P. B.; Roberts, Gareth G.

For males the steppingstone effect found in this study is similar to that in Buddelmeyer and Wooden (Industrial Relations, 50 (1), 109-30, 2011). Whereas Buddelmeyer and Wooden (Industrial Relations, 50(1), 109-30, 2011) find no steppingstone effect of casual employment for females, this study shows the effects occur to them. The positive result for females appears to be driven by weakened labour market conditions. This suggests that for females the steppingstone effect of casual employment could be sensitive to broad economic conditions.

Repeat patient testing-quality control with canine samples shows promise as an alternative to commercial quality control material for a network of four Sysmex XT-2000<i>i</i>V hematology analyzers	VETERINARY CLINICAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						commercial quality control; harmonization; hematology; repeat patient testing-quality control; Sysmex		BackgroundRepeat patient testing-quality control (RPT-QC) uses retained patient samples as an alternative to commercial quality control material (QCM). We elected to calculate and validate RPT-QC limits for red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HBG), hematocrit (HCT), and white blood cell count (WBC). Objectives(1) To validate RPT-QC across a network of four harmonized Sysmex XT-2000iV hematology analyzers and determine the total error that can be controlled with RPT-QC. (2) To generate quality control (QC) limits using the standard deviation (SD) of the duplicate measurement differences and determine a suitable simple QC rule with a probability of error detection >0.85 and probability of false rejection <0.05. (3) Monitor RPT-QC using sigma metrics as a performance indicator and (4) to challenge RPT-QC to ensure acceptable sensitivity. MethodsFresh adult canine EDTA samples with results within reference intervals were selected and run again on days 2, 3, and 4. QC limits were generated from the SD of the duplicate measurement differences. The QC limits were challenged using interventions designed to promote unstable system performance. The total error detectable by RPT-QC was determined using EZRULES 3 software. ResultsIn all, 20-40 data points were needed for RPT-QC calculations and validated using 20 additional data points. The calculated limits differed among the network of analyzers. The total error that could be controlled was the same or better than that of the manufacturer's commercially available quality control material using the same analyzer for all measurands except hematocrit, which required a higher total error goal than that proposed by ASVCP guidelines to achieve an acceptable probability of error detection. The challenges designed to mimic unstable system performance were successfully detected as out-of-control QC. ConclusionsThe challenges for RPT-QC resulted in acceptable detection of potential unstable system performance. This initial study demonstrates that RPT-QC limits differ among the network of Sysmex XT-2000iV analyzers, indicating a requirement to customize for the individual analyzer and laboratory conditions. RPT-QC could achieve ASVCP total allowable error goals for RBC, HGB, and WBC, but not for HCT. Sigma metrics were consistently >5.5 for RBC, HGB, and WBC, but not for HCT.

Peripheral nerve involvement in hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by quantitative magnetic resonance neurography	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						electrophysiology; hereditary spastic paraplegia; magnetic resonance neurography (MRN); magnetization transfer contrast imaging; T2-relaxometry	FAMILIAL AMYLOID POLYNEUROPATHY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; RELAXATION; INJURY; TIME; MRI	Background and objectives: Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are heterogenous genetic disorders. While peripheral nerve involvement is frequent in spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7), the evidence of peripheral nerve involvement in SPG4 is more controversial. We aimed to characterize lower extremity peripheral nerve involvement in SPG4 and SPG7 by quantitative magnetic resonance neurography (MRN). Methods: Twenty--six HSP patients carrying either the SPG4 or SPG7 mutation and 26 age-/sex-matched healthy controls prospectively underwent high-resolution MRN with large coverage of the sciatic and tibial nerve. Dual-echo turbo-spin-echo sequences with spectral fat-saturation were utilized for T2-relaxometry and morphometric quantification, while two gradient-echo sequences with and without an off--resonance saturation rapid frequency pulse were applied for magnetization transfer contrast (MTC) imaging. HSP patients additionally underwent detailed neurologic and electroneurographic assessments. Results: All microstructural (proton spin density [.], T2-relaxation time, magnetization transfer ratio) and morphometric (cross-sectional area) quantitative MRN markers were decreased in SPG4 and SPG7 indicating chronic axonopathy.. was superior in differentiating subgroups and identifying subclinical nerve damage in SPG4 and SPG7 without neurophysiologic signs of polyneuropathy. MRN markers correlated well with clinical scores and electroneurographic results. Conclusions: MRN characterizes peripheral nerve involvement in SPG4 and SPG7 as a neuropathy with predominant axonal loss. Evidence of peripheral nerve involvement in SPG4 and SPG7, even without electroneurographically manifest polyneuropathy, and the good correlation of MRN markers with clinical measures of disease progression, challenge the traditional view of the existence of HSPs with isolated pyramidal signs and suggest MRN markers as potential progression biomarkers in HSP.

Quality of life has been extensively studied within various theoretical frameworks. It has been used to guide the provision of appropriate support in daily life. In addition, a vast body of scientific literature has focused on the theoretical and practical underpinnings of self-determination as a construct in itself. To understand how self-determination is an essential supporting concept in the quality of life paradigm, this brief report unravels the complementary but unique role that each construct (quality of life and self-determination) embodies. Furthermore, we discuss the role of self-determination in the scientific literature and in the quality of life of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, reflecting on how both lines of research can converge and be aligned from a common approach. The aim is to drive attention to areas of future research development that strengthen understanding of quality of life and the self-determination construct.

This study aimed to study the prevalence of HP infection and treatment outcomes in Thailand. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the results of the urea breath test (UBT) performed at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between 2018 and 2021. The prevalence of HP infection was evaluated in dyspeptic patients undergoing UBT screening. In patients with known HP infection, the treatment regimen and the success rate in each patient were recorded. ResultsOne-thousand nine-hundred and two patients were included in this study. The prevalence of HP infection in dyspeptic patients was 20.77% (UBT was positive in 65 out of 313 patients). Of the 1589 patients who received the first treatment regimen, 1352 (85.08%) had a negative UBT result. Patients who failed in each treatment regimen were treated with subsequent regimens. The overall success rates for the second, third, and fourth regimens were 69.87% (109 of 156 patients), 53.85% (14 of 26 patients), and 50% (3 of 6 patients), respectively. Univariate logistic regression analysis found that using lansoprazole was associated with failure of treatment with OR = 2.11 (95% CI: 1.14-3.92, P = 0.018). ConclusionCurrent primary HP treatment regimens have an eradication rate of >80%. Even though the previous regimens failed, without available antibiotic sensitivity results, the subsequent regimens were successful by at least 50%. In cases of multiple-treatment failure and where antibiotic sensitivity tests were unavailable, continuing to change regimens could provide satisfactory results.

Bioactive impact of manuka honey and bone char incorporated into gelatin and chitosan cryogels in a rat calvarial fracture model	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						bone char; bone regeneration; cryogel; manuka honey; osteoinductivity; rat fracture model; tissue engineering	EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; TISSUE; SCAFFOLDS; DEFECT; HYDROXYAPATITE; COMBINATION; POLYMERS; AGENT; CELLS; FOCUS	Bone tissue engineered scaffolds are designed to mimic the natural environment for regeneration when typical healing is inhibited. Autografts are the current gold standard for treatment but are limited by available bone and supplementary surgical sites that broaden complications and comorbidities. Cryogels are an ideal scaffold in bone regeneration due to their mechanical integrity and marcoporous structure that elicits angiogenesis and subsequently new bone tissue formation. To aid in bioactivity and osteoinductivity, manuka honey (MH) and bone char (BC) were added to gelatin and chitosan cryogels (CG). Manuka honey has powerful antimicrobial properties to aid against graft infection, and bone char is composed of 90% hydroxyapatite, a well-studied bioactive material. These additives are natural, abundant, easy to use, and cost effective. CG cryogels incorporated with either BC or MH, and plain CG cryogels were implanted into rat calvarial fracture models for cortical bone regeneration analysis. We found indication of bioactivity with both bone char and manuka honey through the presence of woven bone structure in histology stains and micro computed tomography (microCT) data. Overall, plain CG cryogels supported greater bone regeneration capabilities than the BC or MH incorporated cryogels due to a lack of advanced organized tissue formation and collagen deposition after 8 weeks of implantation; however, future work should explore varying additive concentrations and delivery methods to further assess additive potential.

This systematic review aims to investigate the barriers and facilitators for children and adults with overweight or obesity when implementing lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss in primary care. A systematic review was conducted by searching four databases to identify eligible studies (1969-2022). The Critical Appraisal Skills Program was used to assess the study quality. A total of 28 studies were included, of which 21 focused on adults and seven on children and their parents. Thematic synthesis of the 28 studies included identified nine key themes, of which support, role of the general practitioner, structure of the lifestyle intervention program, logistics, and psychological factors were the most common. This review shows that a strong support system and a personalized lifestyle intervention are essential components for successful implementation. Additional research is needed to identify whether future lifestyle interventions can take these barriers and facilitators into account and still be feasible for losing weight.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few data on the concentration of hazardous metals in tattoo inks sold online or by makeshift hawkers. The aim of this work was to organize an analytical methodology to ensure the simultaneous quantitative determination of 18 elements in a complex matrix, like inks for tattooing, by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The total concentrations of metals in the 16 analysed tattoo ink samples ranged from 0.060 to 16.9 g kg(-1). Zinc is the most present metal in the samples, in fact it is in the range 3.4-13882 mg kg(-1). In three of the 16 samples the zinc concentrations exceed those required by legislation (2000 mu g g(-1)). Cr concentration in all cases is higher than allowed (0.5 mu g g(-1)). The weight loss by heating the ink samples to 105 degrees C and, subsequently, to 550 degrees C showed that in all cases the volatile component (ethanol, solvents, etc.) varies from 48 (Wh1) to 95 %, while the percentages of the residue at 550 degrees C ranged from 0 % (BK0) to 47 % (Wh1). Considering values limit, four of analysed samples should not be used by tattoo artists.

Recently, endoscopic OCT angiography (OCTA) was successfully achieved in distal scanning systems using an internal-motor-driving catheter. In conventional OCT systems using externally driving catheters, the mechanical instability in the proximal actuation causes difficulties for differentiating capillaries in tissues. In this study, OCTA in an endoscopic OCT system using an external-motor-driving catheter was proposed. Blood vessels were visualized by using a high-stability inter-A-scan scheme and the spatiotemporal singular value decomposition algorithm. It is not limited by nonuniform rotation distortion caused by the catheter and physiological motion artifacts. Results show that microvasculature in a custom-made microfluidic phantom and the submucosal capillaries in the mouse rectum are successfully visualized. Furthermore, OCTA using a catheter with a small size (outer diameter less than 1 mm) makes it possible for early diagnosis of narrow lumens, such as pancreatic and bile duct cancers.

Although aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has become the ideal tool for killing planktonic bacteria, AIE luminogens (AIEgens) often lack DNase-mimetic activity, so as to suffer from poor anti-biofilm capacity. Here, an "AIEzyme", a kind of AIE nanomaterial with enzyme-like activity, is designed and synthesized, where the AIEgens are used as the ligands of Zr-based coordination polymer nanoparticles. Not only does AIEzyme have enduring DNase-mimetic activity with low activation energy, but also structural rigidity-stabilized fluorescence. Due to the long-acting hydrolysis for eDNA in biofilm, AIEzyme can efficiently disorganize the established biofilms with good penetrability and realize the healing of superbug-infected wounds under only one dose of AIEzyme. This work provides a strategy to endow ordinary AIEgens with DNase-like and anti-biofilm activities. Moreover, AIEzymes can be observed by virtue of their own AIE character, facilitating the study on self-positioning and residual amount of AIEzymes in wounds. The concept "AIEzyme" would hopefully stimulate the tremendous expansion for the tool kits and the application of AIEgens and artificial enzymes.

Herein, we report the syntheses of novel chiral terpolymers with unprecedented statistical distributions of carbonate and ester units (up to 50 % junction units) via the one-pot reaction of cyclohexene oxide, phthalic anhydride, and CO2 under mild conditions using enantiopure bimetallic aluminum-complex-based catalyst systems. Notably, all resulting terpolymers exhibited excellent enantioselectivities (>= 96 % ee) that were independent of the carbonate-ester distribution. The statistical compositions of the carbonate and ester units in the resulting terpolymers were determined via H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopies. Furthermore, thermal properties were tuned by altering the ester content of the chiral terpolymer without influencing the enantioselective ring-opening step involving the meso-epoxide. This asymmetric terpolymerization methodology is also compatible with a variety of meso-epoxides to afford the corresponding terpolymers with 17 %-25 % junction units and excellent enantioselectivities (94 %-99 % ee). The present study is expected to provide new guidelines for preparing a broad range of biodegradable polymers with excellent enantioselectivities and adjustable properties.

Multi-Step Nucleation of a Crystalline Silicate Framework via a Structurally Precise Prenucleation Cluster	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article; Early Access						Cyclosilicate Hydrate; Multi-Step Nucleation; Polyanions; Prenucleation Clusters; Self-Assembly	GROWTH; HYBRID	Hierarchical nucleation pathways are ubiquitous in the synthesis of minerals and materials. In the case of zeolites and metal-organic frameworks, preorganized multi-ion "secondary building units" (SBUs) have been proposed as fundamental building blocks. However, detailing the progress of multi-step reaction mechanisms from monomeric species to stable crystals and defining the structures of the SBUs remains an unmet challenge. Combining in situ nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle X-ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy, we show that crystallization of the framework silicate, cyclosilicate hydrate, occurs through an assembly of cubic octameric Q(8)(3) polyanions formed through cross-linking and polymerization of smaller silicate monomers and other oligomers. These Q(8)(3) are stabilized by hydrogen bonds with surrounding H2O and tetramethylammonium ions (TMA(+)). When Q(8)(3) levels reach a threshold of approximate to 32% of the total silicate species, nucleation occurs. Further growth proceeds through the incorporation of [(TMA)(x)(Q(8)(3))center dot nH(2)O]((x-8)) clathrate complexes into step edges on the crystals.

However, most of them rely on rare, precious metals as principal components, and integrating the functions of light absorption and catalysis into a single molecular unit based on abundant metals remains a challenge. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which can be regarded as intermediate compounds between molecules and inorganic solids, are potential platforms for the construction of a simple photocatalytic system composed only of Earth-abundant nontoxic elements. In this work, we report that a tin-based MOF enables the conversion of CO2 into formic acid with a record high apparent quantum yield (9.8 % at 400 nm) and >99 % selectivity without the need for any additional photosensitizer or catalyst. This work highlights a new MOF with strong potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction driven by solar energy.

A retrospective cohort study	JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access						community; developmental; education; intelligence quotient	DELAY; CHILDREN	AimThis study sought to assess the association between early developmental assessment of toddlers with idiopathic global developmental delay (GDD) and their later intelligence test scores. MethodsToddlers with idiopathic GDD attending a community clinic over a 6-year period were assessed initially using the Griffiths Mental Development Scales - Extended Revised version (GMDS-ER) and later completing formal intelligence testing using the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale - 5th Edition (SB5) at age 4-6 years. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the association of quotient scores across the tools. The composite quotient (GQ) and the subscale quotients of GMDS-ER were correlated with the full-scale IQ (FSIQ), verbal and non-verbal IQ scores from the SB5. ResultsThirty of 153 children assessed at the clinic were eligible for the study. The correlation between GMDS-ER GQ and later SB5 FSIQ was strong (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). The subscales' associations were moderate to strong (0.48-0.71). Eighty-six percent (86%) of children with delay on GMDS-ER GQ were found later to be in the impaired category based on the FSIQ of the SB5. ConclusionThere was a strong association between toddlers' early developmental quotients and later IQ scores for children with idiopathic GDD, though agreement between early GDD diagnoses and later intellectual disability is not absolute. Individualised care is needed around prognostic advice and recommendations to caregivers and families in the early years, so they may effectively plan for interventions, supports and later reassessment to optimise their child's development and learning.

Herein, a highly stretchable polymer semiconductor is reported that shows concurrently improved thin film crystallinity and stretchability upon thermal annealing. The polymer thin films annealed at temperatures higher than their crystallization temperatures exhibit substantially improved thin film stretchability (> 200%) and hole mobility (>= 0.2 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). The simultaneous enhancement of the crystallinity and stretchability is attributed to the thermally-assisted structural phase transition that allows the formation of edge-on crystallites and reinforces interchain noncovalent interactions. These results provide new insights into how the current crystallinity-stretchability limitation can be overcome. Furthermore, the results will facilitate the design of high-mobility stretchable polymer semiconductors for high-performance stretchable electronics.

Scant information is available on their potential interactions with hepatic xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. This work aimed to evaluate in vitro the potential inhibitory effects of widely employed acaricides on catalytic activities mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) and flavin--monooxygenase (FMO) enzymes in cattle. Bovine (n = 4) liver microsomes were incubated in the absence (control assays) and in presence of different OPs (fenthion, chlorpyrifos, ethion, diazinon and dichlorvos), fipronil and cypermethrin at 0.1-100 mu m. Five oxidative enzyme activities were assayed by spectrofluorimetric or HPLC methods: 7--ethoxyresorufin O--deethylase (for CYP1A1), methoxyresorufin O--demethylase (for CYP1A2), benzyloxyresorufin O--debenzylase (for CYP2B), testosterone 6--beta hydroxylase (for CYP3A) and benzydamine N--oxidase (for FMO). All acaricides, particularly phosphorothionate--containing OPs, inhibited to some extent more than one enzyme activity. The most frequent inhibitor was fenthion, which inhibited (p <.05) all enzyme activities tested (from 22% at 1 mu m to 72% at 100 mu m). However, low inhibitory potencies (IC50s higher than 7 mu m) of all acaricides studied were observed against the catalytic activities assayed. Therefore, the risk of in vivo metabolic interactions due to inhibition of monooxygenases would be low under common husbandry conditions.

Large-Area Synthesis of Ferromagnetic Fe<sub>5-</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>GeTe<sub>2</sub>/Graphene van der Waals Heterostructures with Curie Temperature above Room Temperature	SMALL			English	Article; Early Access						2D magnets; 2D spintronics; Fe5-xGeTe2; graphene; van der Waals epitaxy; van der Waals heterostructures	GRAPHENE; PROXIMITY; EPITAXY; GROWTH; WSE2	Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining layered ferromagnets and other 2D crystals are promising building blocks for the realization of ultracompact devices with integrated magnetic, electronic, and optical functionalities. Their implementation in various technologies depends strongly on the development of a bottom-up scalable synthesis approach allowing for realizing highly uniform heterostructures with well-defined interfaces between different 2D-layered materials. It is also required that each material component of the heterostructure remains functional, which ideally includes ferromagnetic order above room temperature for 2D ferromagnets. Here, it is demonstrated that the large-area growth of Fe5-xGeTe2/graphene heterostructures is achieved by vdW epitaxy of Fe5-xGeTe2 on epitaxial graphene. Structural characterization confirms the realization of a continuous vdW heterostructure film with a sharp interface between Fe5-xGeTe2 and graphene. Magnetic and transport studies reveal that the ferromagnetic order persists well above 300 K with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. In addition, epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) continues to exhibit a high electronic quality. These results represent an important advance beyond nonscalable flake exfoliation and stacking methods, thus marking a crucial step toward the implementation of ferromagnetic 2D materials in practical applications.

We report the discovery of FasT, a rare type I FAS from the cyanobacterium Chlorogloea sp. CCALA695. FasT possesses an unusual off-loading domain, which was heterologously expressed in E. coli and found to act as an alpha-oxoamine synthase (AOS) in vitro. Similar to serine palmitoyltransferases from sphingolipid biosynthesis, the AOS off-loading domain catalyzes a decarboxylative Claisen condensation between l-serine and a fatty acyl thioester. While the AOS domain was strictly specific for l-serine, thioesters with saturated fatty acyl chains of six carbon atoms and longer were tolerated, with the highest activity observed for stearoyl-coenzyme A (C-18). Our findings suggest a novel route to alpha-amino ketones via the direct condensation of iteratively produced long-chain fatty acids with l-serine by a FAS with a cis-acting AOS off-loading domain.

Proton radiation hardness of GaInAsP alloys for space solar cell applications	PROGRESS IN PHOTOVOLTAICS			English	Article; Early Access						DLTS; GaInAsP solar cells; proton irradiation; radiation hardness; radiation-induced defects	LEVEL TRANSIENT SPECTROSCOPY	Recent technology development in space mission design has raised a demand for space solar cells with a higher level of radiation tolerance as compared with state-of-the-art, commercially available products. Therefore, new material systems are being investigated. Recently, we highlighted the superior radiation tolerance of GaInAsP solar cells to 1 MeV electron irradiation as compared with standard GaAs solar cells. A high InP fraction within this semiconductor compound was found to foster the regeneration rate of electron-induced defects when the solar cells were annealed at 60 degrees C under AM0 illumination, which are typical space-operating conditions. In light of considering this material system in future radiation-hard designs, the degradation of GaInAsP solar cells subjected to proton irradiation also needs to be investigated. Here, we report on the degradation and regeneration of GaInAsP solar cells lattice-matched to InP substrates after 1 MeV proton irradiation. A detailed description of the radiation damage is achieved by solar cell numerical modeling combined with deep-level transient spectroscopy analysis. The irradiation-induced defects are quantified, and their evolution during annealing is monitored. The results are compared with the degradation data of similar solar cells obtained after 1 MeV electron irradiation. A slower regeneration rate of the proton-induced defects is found in comparison with the electron-induced defects. This difference is ultimately attributed to a different topology of the radiation damage caused by proton irradiation.

J	Sapong, NYB				Sapong, Nana Yaw Boampong			The contentious Ghanaian: An historical appraisal of social movements in Ghana	HISTORY COMPASS			English	Article							STRUGGLES; GENDER	Ideas of freedom, liberty, and social justice are germane to most societies, including African societies. The quest for these values also often involves contentions, dialog, and compromise. Sadly, the often-told stories of political and social change in Africa are brush-stroked with bloodshed, tears, and anguish. This Africa of pessimism, unfulfilled dreams, state-sponsored violence, and civil wars is a familiar headline in the global North. This work, however, proposes that African countries such as Ghana have been resolving their disagreements and contentions through other means. These range from subtle, subversive, noncompliant and complex responses to the less preferred direct and open confrontation with authority. Secondly, the historiography of protest movements in Ghana reveals a lingering preference for twentieth century social movements, neglecting nineteenth century forms of protest and social movement bases, which employed subtlety, noncompliance, and sometimes, direct confrontation. Lastly, initial social movement literature showed a preponderance of male-dominated narratives, which eventually led to the creation of female-inspired alternate narratives. Using selected works in social movement theory, general surveys on the history of Ghana, monographs, journal articles, book chapters and unpublished theses, this article seeks to offer a panoramic view of the history-writing of social movements and its prospects in Ghana.

It is challenging to stabilise the G-quadruplex structure, which can take on a variety of topologies and is known to inhibit specific biological processes. To achieve this, 4-nitrobenzylidene curcumin (NBC), the Knoevenagel condensate of curcumin, was synthesized and characterized. The interaction of 4-nitrobenzylidene curcumin with parallel (c-MYC) and hybrid (H-telo) G-quadruplex structures was studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV-thermal melting, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and docking studies. The outcome demonstrates that, in a K+-rich solution, the ligand NBC can stabilise the parallel c-MYC and hybrid H-telo G-quadruplex structures by 5?. The absorption and fluorescence studies show that the ligand NBC binds to c-MYC and H-telo with affinities of 0.3 x 10(6) M-1 and 0.6 x 10(6) M-1, respectively. The ligand interacts with the terminal G-quartet of the quadruplex structure via intercalation and the groove mode of binding, well supported by docking studies as well. NBC has more potent antioxidant activity as compared to the curcumin and 4-nitro benzaldehyde. It was also found to have higher cytotoxic activity towards cell line such as HeLa and MCF-7, while less cytotoxic for healthy Vero cells. Overall, the results show that the Knoevenagel product of curcumin can work better as a G-quadruplex binder and could be used as a possible treatment.

In the preparation of SiNPs, we have studied the effects of different parameters such as solvent, catalyst, temperature, water and precursor on the shape and size of SiNPs. It shows that the size of SiNPs was increased with an increase in the concentration of ethanol and acid catalyst; the particle size was decreased with an increase in reaction temperature and precursor. To develop the drug for photodynamic therapy against the target tumor cells, protoporphyrin (PpIX), an efficient photosensitizer is functionalized on the surface of SiNPs. The drug loading potential was studied by the conjugation of 5-Fluorouracil on the surface of functionalized SiNPs.

A field study was conducted across five environments to contrast the use of six annual species (berseem clover, Trifolium alexandrinum L.; forage peas, Pisum sativum L.; annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum Lamarck; oat; Japanese millet, Echinochloa esculenta [A. Braun] H. Scholz; sudangrass, Sorghum x drummondii [Nees ex. Steud.] Millsp. & Chase) as companion crops for the establishment of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-timothy (Phleum pratense L.) mixtures. The control treatment consisted of the perennial species seeded without companion crop. Treatments were seeded at three dates and evaluated during the seeding and post-seeding years. The performance of the six companion crops evaluated herein varied depending on the seeding date and the environment. For a mid-May to early June seeding total seeding year forage mass was greatest with use of oat, Japanese millet, or sudangrass as companion crops; for a mid-June to late June seeding with Japanese millet or sudangrass; and for a late July to early August seeding with oat or Japanese millet. These species, however, reduced in some environments seeding year alfalfa or timothy mass compared to a control seeded without a companion crop. Such reduction was also observed in some environments in the first post-seeding year. Companion crop choice to establish alfalfa-timothy mixtures needs to take into consideration seeding date and forage needs on the short term versus the long term.

In the outer circular cavity, an array of two periodic metal slots, tilted at an angle, resonate at 25.32, 26.44, and 28.83 GHz, and the inner circular cavity's periodic slots radiate at 28.01 GHz. Two concentric SIW cavities are structured in such a distinct manner that no loss due to leakage takes place thus, achieving a maximum isolation of -43.8 dB at 28.83 GHz. The miniaturized antenna has dimensions of 2.2 lambda(o) x 2.2 lambda(o) x 0.1 lambda(o) where lambda(o) is the operating wavelength. It achieves a maximum gain of 9.1 dBi at 26.44 GHz, and VSWR < 2 is achieved at all frequency bands. The antenna is circularly polarized at 26.44 and 28.01 GHz as well. The design results are plotted in the Ansys high-frequency structure simulator version EM19.2 tool. The proposed antenna is fabricated and tested using an Anritsu Vector Network Analyzer version v4.0 with an anechoic chamber setup.

People with PTSD often judge ambiguous information as negative or threatening (interpretation bias). However, this may be adaptive during deployment. The current study aimed to investigate the extent to which interpretation bias in combat personnel is associated with PTSD symptoms, rather than with appropriate situational awareness. Combat veterans with and without PTSD and civilians without PTSD generated explanations for ambiguous situations and judged the likelihood of various possible explanations. They also made judgements about future consequences of worst-case scenarios, and their coping ability. Veterans with PTSD generated more negative explanations for ambiguous situations, judged negative interpretations as more likely and felt less able to cope with the worst-case scenario than veteran and civilian controls. Veterans with versus without PTSD judged worst-case scenarios to have more severe and insurmountable consequences, although they did not differ significantly from civilians. Veteran versus civilian controls rated their coping ability as higher; this was the only difference between control groups. In summary, group differences in interpretation bias were associated with PTSD symptoms rather than combat role. Veterans without PTSD may be particularly resilient when coping with everyday adversity.

The stock price process is characterized by a factor model and investors can only observe past stock price data. All investors share a common investment period and have constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility functions. We construct explicit linear feedback equilibria for both a finite population game and a corresponding MFG. Filtering theory and dynamic programming method are involved to solve two kinds of optimization problems with partial information. Our results show that the limiting strategy for n$$ n $$-agent game can be derived as equilibrium of suitable MFG in a partially observable financial market.

Temperature and winter duration requirements for reproductive success in johnny darter <i>Etheostoma nigrum</i> in the South Platte River basin, Colorado	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						conservation; fish physiology; freshwater fish; Great Plains; policy	PERCH PERCA-FLAVESCENS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAM TEMPERATURES; POPULATION-GROWTH; WATER; LIFE; CONSUMPTION; DOWNSTREAM; DYNAMICS; SURVIVAL	Changes in water temperature and its seasonal timing influences the physiological processes of many aquatic ectotherms. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) contribute to warmer and more consistent water temperatures in streams draining the North American Great Plains, particularly during winter months. Reduced variation in seasonal water temperature may adversely affect fishes that rely on temperature fluctuation or specific overwintering temperatures for reproductive cues. We used johnny darter Etheostoma nigrum (Family Percidae), a thermally sensitive species native to the South Platte River Basin, as a focal species to assess the effects of winter water temperature regulations in Colorado. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of winter stream temperature and winter duration on reproductive success of johnny darter in the laboratory to inform development of water quality criteria for the South Platte River Basin. Winter duration (60, 90 or 120 days) and temperature (4 or 12 degrees C) were crossed in a factorial design of six treatments that simulated warmed effluent-impacted streams as well as streams with a more natural thermal regime. We defined reproductive success in johnny darter by examining four reproductive endpoints: (1) spawning timing, (2) egg and larvae production, (3) egg success, and (4) egg development. Across the four endpoints, seven main response variables were measured: spawning initiation date, eggs per gram of female per week, live larvae per gram of female per week, fertilisation success, hatching success, egg-to-larva survival and days to hatch. Winter temperature and duration influenced spawning timing and egg development. Earlier spawning initiation dates were observed in fish exposed to 12 degrees C winters and was associated with a higher number of days to hatch. Eggs per gram of female per week, live larvae per gram of female per week, fertilisation success, hatching success, and egg-to-larva survival were similar among winter treatments. Although the State of Colorado chronic winter water temperature standard of 12 degrees C appears to be adequate for egg and larvae production in johnny darter, our results showed that fish exposed to the standard began spawning significantly earlier than fish exposed to 4 degrees C winters. Evaluating reproductive output in the context of seasonal timing is valid because spawning timing has the potential to affect overall production and egg development, and consequently recruitment and population sustainability. Therefore, spawning timing should be considered when making management decisions and revising water temperature standards. The warming of streams and rivers from WWTP effluent is a global issue, especially in areas that are undergoing rapid urbanisation. Fishes are particularly sensitive to water temperature and many fishes worldwide are likely to be experiencing changes in important physiological processes, affecting both reproduction and survival. Our study indicates that reproductive timing could be influenced by stream warming and stresses the need for further studies on the influence of anthropogenic effects on stream warming.

Strain-Induced Distortions Modulate the Optoelectronic Properties of Epitaxial BiVO<sub>4</sub> Films	ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						epitaxial films; epitaxial strain; pulsed laser deposition	BISMUTH VANADATE; THIN-FILMS; GROWTH; SEMICONDUCTORS; PHOTOCATALYST; LUMINESCENCE; PHOTOANODES; TRANSITION; HYDROGEN; SI	Transition metal oxide (TMO) photoabsorbers are expected to play an important role in the development of renewable solar-to-fuel devices. Modest efficiencies have been demonstrated with devices based on TMO photoabsorbers, and further progress will likely rely on material property control beyond conventional bulk chemistry or nanostructuring strategies. To this end, model TMO photoabsorbers such as single crystalline monoclinic bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) are beneficial to advance the understanding of structure-functionality relationships with minimal convoluted effects inherent in polycrystalline systems. Here, the authors reveal for the first time the effects of strain modulation strategies on the optoelectronic properties of epitaxial BiVO4 films synthesized by alternate-target layer-by-layer pulsed laser deposition. Through a combination of high-resolution X-ray diffraction methods and optical and photoluminescence spectroscopies, the correlation between anisotropic, uniaxial strain-driven bandgap widening and deviatoric strains associated with volume-preserving lattice distortions is established. Broad polaronic photoluminescence signals are detected in epitaxial BiVO4, and its redshift is attributed to the structural distortion in BiO8 dodecahedra. Overall, the relationship between the structural and optoelectronic properties revealed in this study suggests that strain modulation and engineering of local distortion in complex transition metal oxides may be exploited as a viable strategy for the development of efficient photoabsorbers.

The effects of the laminated cofiring and the random distribution processes on the crystal structure and microwave dielectric properties of the composite ceramics were investigated. The advantages of the unique tri-layer architecture were fully demonstrated. It not only allows the effects of the chemical reactions between ZnZrNb1.99(Sn0.5W0.5)(0.01)O-8 and TiO2 can be effectively limited to a narrow region (similar to 20 mu m in width) within the ZnZrNb1.99(Sn0.5W0.5)(0.01)O-8/TiO2 interfaces, and acts as the "glues" to bond each layer well. The layers are well connected and the possibility of deterioration of Qx f values during the modification process can be greatly reduced. When compared with ZnZrNb1.99(Sn0.5W0.5)(0.01)O-8@TiO2 ceramics with random distribution type, the tri-layer design can produce a roughly 60% improvement in Qx f value with no noticeable loss in dielectric constant while maintaining temperature stability. After sintering at 1340 degrees C for 6 h, ZnZrNb(1.9)9(Sn0.5W0.5)(0.01)O-8-TiO2-ZnZrNb1.99(Sn0.5W0.5)(0.01)O-8 tri-layer ceramics exhibited excellent dielectric properties (epsilon(r) = 30.29, Qx f = 56,880 GHz, and tau(f) = -5.73 ppm/degrees C) with 0.05 wt% TiO2, and the cooperative optimization of microwave dielectric properties was achieved. The current research provides a strategy for synthesizing microwave dielectric devices with high dielectric properties for applications in 5G network communications.

Herein, a series of donor-pi-acceptor (D-pi-A) type small molecules is demonstrated based on 2,2 ':6 ',2 ''-terpyridine (TPy) as the acceptor moiety, benzene ring as the pi-linker, and incorporating various donors to act as HTMs. These TPy-based molecules coated atop PTAA manipulate the energy level and surface wettability, but the incorporation of the phenoxazine (POZ) donor can be prominent for enhancing charge transport and defect passivation, thereby simultaneously addressing the above-mentioned issues. The highest power conversion efficiency of 22.36% can be achieved with an open-circuit voltage (V-OC) of 1.15 V, a short-circuit current density (J(SC)) of 23.96 mA cm(-2), and a fill factor (FF) of 81.16% for the optimized POZ-TPy-modified device. Moreover, the power PCE of a large POZ-TPy-modified device (1.96 cm(2)) can still reach more than 21%. These results are among one of the highest efficiencies for inverted PSCs, indicating the enormous potential of POZ-TPy HTM in future perovskite applications.

J	Jadhav, A; Shandilya, SK				Jadhav, Akshay; Kumar Shandilya, Shishir			Towards effective feature selection in estimating software effort using machine learning	JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS			English	Article; Early Access						dimensionality reduction; feature selection; machine learning; software effort estimation; software engineering		Software effort estimation is a vital process in the software industry for successfully administering 5Ds of the software development life cycle (SDLC). The 5Ds stand for demand, development, direction, deployment, and designated cost of the software. Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is an effort prediction mechanism to calculate the effort for the development of the software product in order to minimize the challenges in the software field. Academics and practitioners are striving to identify which machine learning estimation technique yields more accurate results based on evaluation metrics, datasets, and other pertinent aspects. The feature selection techniques impact accuracy by selecting the main and relevant features in the dataset and eliminating the redundant and irrelevant features in the dataset. To achieve accurate estimations, the paper utilizes feature selection algorithms, along with various machine learning techniques, which predict the desired effort and the performance of the model has been measured in terms of prediction accuracy, R-2 value, relative error, and mean absolute error. The datasets China and Maxwell are trained with the relevant features by applying feature selection algorithms, and estimation techniques are applied to predict the effort. The performance is compared with the regression models and feature selection techniques utilized by many authors previously. The result of the proposed methodology significantly gives the best performance with the combination of feature selection and estimation models than all regression models when applied alone, to both datasets. From the results, it is perceptible that random forest is performing well with the feature selection techniques and obtains the highest prediction accuracy of 99.33% with the China and 89.47% with the Maxwell datasets.

To answer this question, we draw on the knowledge-based view of innovation. Specifically, we theorize that the collective turnover of a firm engenders complex changes in knowledge insourcing needed for generating innovation, which may lead to the attenuating negative effect of turnover on innovation. This study also aims to investigate a contingency that modifies the detrimental effect of collective turnover on innovation. Specifically, we identify knowledge-sharing system (KSS) as a positive knowledge-related contingency that engenders a U-shaped curvilinear relationship between collective turnover and firm innovation. In addition, replenishing human capital by hiring new employees improves knowledge insourcing quality and diversity, thereby constituting the mechanism through which collective turnover affects firm innovation. An analysis of large-scale firm-level data collected from 2259 Korean firms over a 6-year period supports most hypotheses and confirms the positive effect of high turnover on firm innovation through replacement hiring and under favorable firm contingencies, such as a high KSS. This study provides a balanced perspective by revealing the costs and benefits of collective turnover and explains when and how turnover can facilitate firm innovation.

Here, we identified that reprogramming of nucleotide metabolism as an important factor divides mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) into two groups with different transcriptional signalling pathways and varying prognoses. We establish a nucleotide metabolism-related prognostic model that includes six genes with different regression coefficients, which significantly predicts prognosis for MCL patients (p < 0.0001). Of these six genes, de novo CTP synthesis pathway enzyme CTPS1 whose inhibitor (STP938) is already in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory lymphomas (NCT05463263) has the highest regression coefficient. An increase in CTPS1 expression predicts adverse overall survival and progression-free survival with independent prognostic significance in 105 primary MCL samples and GEO database (GSE93291). CRISPR CTPS1 knockout causes DNA damage and proliferation defects in MCL. Additionally, MYC positively regulates CTPS1 expression, and TP53-aberrant and ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells also rely on cytidine metabolism. Furthermore, besides the obvious decreased CTP pool caused by CTPS1 deficiency, CTPS1 inhibition may also induce immune-related responses via activating dsDNA-cGAS-STING pathway, which plays a crucial role in impeding tumour growth in MCL patients.

Development of salt and alkali tolerant varieties is still dominated by the following conventional breeding method: The salt and alkali tolerant traits from screened germplasm are introduced into elite varieties by means of hybridization and backcrossing. In recent years, the breeding of salt and alkali tolerant rice has also made great progress. For example, the yield of Chao-You 1000, a two-line rice hybrid, has reached 12.04 t/ha growing in fields with salinity between 0.2% and 0.6%. This review is an update on the progress of salt and alkali tolerant rice germplasm screening and new salt and alkali tolerant varieties in development. By reviewing the performance of current rice hybrids in China's National Regional Variety Trials of Saline-Alkali Tolerant Rice, we proposed the technical approach of developing saline-alkali tolerant rice hybrids using the third-generation hybrid rice technology and furthermore the trend of developing salt and alkali tolerant rice hybrids.

A comprehensive investigation was conducted for the levels, relationship with soil properties, and potential sources of heavy metals (Hg, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in roadside soils in six cities (Changzhi, Jincheng, Yuncheng, Linfen, Xinzhou, Datong) of Shanxi Province; and the corresponding ecological risk and human health risk associated with the concentrations of heavy metals were addressed. Heavy metal concentrations of 112 roadside soil samples in the surveyed cities were, in decreasing order, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Cd, and Hg, which were higher than corresponding background values. The highest concentrations were in Changzhi. The results of Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that positive correlations in varying degrees existed between soil properties such as electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon with specific heavy metals and that negative correlations were observed for clay and electrical conductivity. Anthropogenic sources related to traffic emissions and industrialization were the main sources of heavy metals in roadside soils according to principal component analysis. The ecological risk assessments were achieved by pollution index and potential risk index, indicating that contamination with Hg was the most serious, which posed the highest risk to the ecosystems in the surveyed cities; and the ecological risk in Changzhi ranked at the top compared with other cities. For the human health risk assessment, the results demonstrated that the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were in the acceptable range in the surveyed cities. However, there was a higher health risk from heavy metal exposure for children than adults, and the main exposure pathway was soil ingestion. In addition, Changzhi was the city with the highest noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, and the main human health risks were posed by Cr contamination in roadside soil, which was different from the results of ecological risks. Both results of ecological and health risk assessment demonstrated that the higher risk exhibited in southern and southeastern cities than northern cities in Shanxi Province.

Trichrome (TC) stain has traditionally been used to evaluate the degree of fibrosis in liver, although it is rarely helpful in assessing quality of fibrosis (i.e. progression and regression). Orcein (OR) stain highlights established elastic fibres, but its use in examining fibrosis is not well recognised. This study assessed the potential utility of comparing OR and TC staining patterns to evaluate the quality of fibrosis in various settings of advanced fibrosis. Methods and resultsThe haematoxylin and eosin and TC stains of 65 liver resection/explant specimens with advanced fibrosis caused by different elements were reviewed. Twenty-two cases were scored as progressive (P), 16 as indeterminate (I) and 27 as regressive (R) using TC stain based on the Beijing criteria. The OR stains confirmed 18 of 22 P cases. The remaining P cases showed either stable fibrosis or mixed P and R. Of the 27 R cases, 26 were supported by OR stain, with many showing thin perforated septa typically seen in adequately treated viral hepatitis cases. The 16 I cases showed a variety of OR staining patterns, which allowed for further subclassification than using TC stain alone. Viral hepatitis cases were enriched for regressive features (17 of 27). ConclusionsOur data demonstrated the utility of OR as an adjunctive stain to evaluate the changes in fibrosis in cases of cirrhosis.

This study was performed during a 2-week period in October 2021 to assess in- and outpatient post-delivery recovery at 1 and 30 days postpartum. The following outcomes were reported: obstetric quality of recovery 10-item measure (ObsQoR-10); EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L) survey; global health visual analogue scale; postpartum pain scores at rest and movement; length of hospital stay; readmission rates; and self-reported complications. In total, 1638 patients were recruited and responses analysed from 1631 (99.6%) and 1282 patients (80%) at one and 30 days postpartum, respectively. Median (IQR [range]) length of stay postpartum was 39.3 (28.5-61.0 [17.7-513.4]), 40.3 (28.5-59.1 [17.8-220.9]), and 35.9 (27.1-54.1 [17.9-188.4]) h following caesarean, instrumental and vaginal deliveries, respectively. Median (IQR [range]) ObsQoR-10 score was 75 ([62-86] 4-100) on day 1, with the lowest ObsQoR-10 scores (worst recovery) reported by patients undergoing caesarean delivery. Of the 1282 patients, complications within the first 30 days postpartum were reported by 252 (19.7%) of all patients. Readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge occurred in 69 patients (5.4%), with 49 (3%) for maternal reasons. These data can be used to inform patients regarding expected recovery trajectories; facilitate optimal discharge planning; and identify populations that may benefit most from targeted interventions to improve postpartum recovery experience.

A safe and effective use of caplacizumab in pregnancy-related acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura	BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						caplacizumab; pregnancy; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura	VON-WILLEBRAND-FACTOR; MANAGEMENT	Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is not uncommonly seen in pregnancy, either with the first episode or with the exacerbation of known disease. The management of TTP in pregnancy can be challenging if there is refractoriness to the use of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and high-dose corticosteroids. Caplacizumab, a vWF-directed humanized antibody fragment, is approved for the treatment of acquired TTP but there is sparse data on its use in pregnant patients. Antenatal and peripartum haemorrhage is a theoretical concern with the use of the medication in the obstetric population. However, as options for treatment of TTP in the patients who have refractory disease are significantly limited, off-label use of caplacizumab to achieve disease control and prevent maternofetal morbidity and mortality is a reasonable consideration. This article described the successful use of caplacizumab in a pregnant patient with acquired TTP and the associated favourable outcome. The patient suffered an exacerbation following initial TPE and became refractory to both plasma exchange and high-dose corticosteroids. Off-label use of caplacizumab resulted in hematologic recovery and successful delivery of a healthy neonate. This case represents a contribution to the sparse literature on the use of this effective medication in an often-challenging clinical situation.

We aimed to investigate whether the association between parental history of dementia and the risk of dementia are different by dementia subtypes and sex of parent and offspring. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, we harmonized and pooled data for 17,194 older adults from nine population-based cohorts of eight countries. These studies conducted face-to-face diagnostic interviews, physical and neurological examinations, and neuropsychological assessments to diagnose dementia. We investigated the associations of maternal and paternal history of dementia with the risk of dementia and its subtypes in offspring. Results: The mean age of the participants was 72.8 +/- 7.9 years and 59.2% were female. Parental history of dementia was associated with higher risk of dementia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-1.86) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.31-2.26), but not with the risk of non-AD. This was largely driven by maternal history of dementia, which was associated with the risk of dementia (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.15-1.97) and AD (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.33-2.43) whereas paternal history of dementia was not. These results remained significant when males and females were analyzed separately (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.28-3.55 in males; OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.16-2.44 for females). Conclusions: Maternal history of dementia was associated with the risk of dementia and AD in both males and females. Maternal history of dementia may be a useful marker for identifying individuals at higher risk of AD and stratifying the risk for AD in clinical trials.

The effect of ozone pretreatment on the CMC properties degree of substitution (DS) and viscosity was investigated. After treatment of CPF with ozone, CMC was prepared by alkalization followed by etherification using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium monochloroacetic acid (NaMCA) in an alcoholic medium. The DS of CMC increased with increased ozone pretreatment time and with increased amounts of NaOH and NaMCA reagents. The CMC solubility increased with increasing DS. Therefore, the solubility increased with ozone pretreatment time. The favored treatment conditions were ozone pretreatment for 3 h, followed by the addition of 10 mL of 30% NaOH and 38.6 mM of NaMCA. Under these conditions, the DS, purity, and solubility were 1.05, 79.6%, and 94.6%, respectively. The viscosity of CMC prepared using cellulose treated with ozone decreased with increasing ozone pretreatment time, which was caused by the reduced degree of polymerization. Therefore, use of ozone pretreatment for CMC preparation is an effective method for controlling CMC properties.

One-carbon metabolism and microbial pathogenicity	MOLECULAR ORAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						bacteria; microbiology; Porphyromonas gingivalis	PORPHYROMONAS-GINGIVALIS; FOLATE-SALVAGE; RIBOSWITCH CLASS; FOLIC-ACID; IN-VIVO; SYNTHETASE; PLANT; TETRAHYDROPTEROYLPOLYGLUTAMATES; BIOSYNTHESIS; PURIFICATION	One-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathways are responsible for several functions, producing a number of one-carbon unit intermediates (formyl, methylene, methenyl, methyl) that are required for the synthesis of various amino acids and other biomolecules such as purines, thymidylate, redox regulators, and, in most microbes, folate. As humans must acquire folate from the diet, folate production is a target for antimicrobials such as sulfonamides. OCM impacts the regulation of microbial virulence such that in a number of instances, limiting the availability of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), an essential OCM precursor, causes a reduction in pathogenicity. Porphyromonas gingivalis, however, displays increased pathogenicity in response to lower pABA levels, and exogenous pABA exerts a calming influence on heterotypic communities of P. gingivalis with pABA-producing partner species. Differential responses to pABA may reflect both the physiology of the organisms and their host microenvironment. OCM plays an integral role in regulating the global rate of protein translation, where the alarmones ZMP and ZTP sense insufficient stores of intracellular folate and coordinate adaptive responses to compensate and restore folate to sufficient levels. The emerging interconnections between OCM, protein synthesis, and context-dependent pathogenicity provide novel insights into the dynamic host-microbe interface.

J	Udeagha, MC; Muchapondwa, E				Udeagha, Maxwell Chukwudi; Muchapondwa, Edwin			Achieving green environment in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa economies: Do composite risk index, green innovation, and environmental policy stringency matter?	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						BRICS economies; carbon neutrality; composite risk index; environmental policy; green innovation; renewable energy research and development	FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; PANEL-DATA; REGIONAL TRADE; CO2 EMISSIONS; COUNTRIES; GROWTH; EU	The Paris Accord has brought the world's governments together to begin implementing plans for their individual economies to become carbon-free. The goal of attaining low-carbon growth is not, however, as simple as it would appear since the world economies, which are dependent on fossil fuels and are fast expanding, are concentrated on accelerating economic expansion at the price of worse environmental effects. In light of this, the study aims to investigate the combined effects of the composite risk index (CRI), green innovation (GINOV), and environmental policy stringency (EPS) on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the context of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries while controlling for gross domestic product (GDP) and renewable energy research and development (RERD) over the period from 1960 to 2020. The research addresses the problems of cross-sectional dependence and slope heterogeneity in the data set used for analysis by using the second-generation cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lags framework to evaluate long- and short-run models. The corresponding findings show cointegrating relationships between the research variables. Additionally, the results of the regression demonstrate that EPS, GINOV, and RERD contribute to a long-term decrease in CO2 emissions. CRI and GDP, however, increase CO2 emissions. It is suggested that environmental policies be tightened, GINOV and RERD expenditures be promoted, political stability and institutional quality be maintained, and clean economic growth strategies be adopted in order to help the BRICS countries reduce sectoral risks, create a sustainable environment, and decarbonize their respective economies.

An association between complete heart block (CHB) and pathogenic titin (TTN) mutations have not been previously described. We report a 9-year-old female with history of leukodystrophy and family history of atrial fibrillation who presented with syncope and conduction abnormalities, including CHB. She underwent pacemaker implantation and genetic testing demonstrated a pathogenic TTN mutation likely responsible for her cardiac findings. Our case suggests an association between TTN mutations and conduction disease and emphasizes broadening gene testing in assessing these patients, especially when a family history is present.

Evaluation of mechlorethamine, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone for the treatment of resistant multicentric canine lymphoma	VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						chemotherapy; dog; rescue	CELL-PROLIFERATION; ACTINOMYCIN-D; VINCRISTINE; DOGS; CHEMOTHERAPY; PROTOCOL; DEXAMETHASONE; EXPRESSION; MELPHALAN	Multi-agent chemotherapy successfully induces remission in most naive, high-grade canine lymphoma patients; however, disease recurrence is common. MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) is an effective rescue protocol used to re-induce remission, but is associated with gastrointestinal toxicity and can be a less desirable option for patients that previously failed vincristine-containing protocols. Therefore, alternative members of the vinca alkaloid family, such as vinblastine, could be potentially advantageous as substitutes for vincristine to reduce gastrointestinal toxicity and chemoresistance. The objective of this study was to report the clinical outcomes and toxicity of 36 dogs with relapsed or refractory multicentric lymphoma treated with a modified MOPP protocol whereby vincristine was replaced with vinblastine (MVPP). The overall response rate to MVPP was 25% with a median progression free survival of 15 days and a median overall survival of 45 days. MVPP at the prescribed doses resulted in modest and transient clinical benefit, but was well tolerated with no treatment delays or hospitalizations secondary to side effects. Given the minimal toxicity, dose intensification could be considered to improve clinical responses.

Recent studies highlighted an important role of the plasma milieu in tuberculosis immunopathology. Here, we investigated monocyte pathology in patients with acute tuberculosis and determined tuberculosis plasma milieu effects on phenotype as well as cytokine signalling of reference monocytes. Patients with tuberculosis (n = 37) and asymptomatic contacts (controls n = 35) were recruited as part of a hospital-based study in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Multiplex flow cytometry phenotyping of monocyte immunopathology was performed and effects of individual blood plasma samples on reference monocytes prior to and during treatment were characterized. Concomitantly, cell signalling pathways were analysed to elucidate underlying mechanisms of plasma effects on monocytes. Multiplex flow cytometry visualization characterized changes in monocyte subpopulations and detected higher expression of CD40, CD64 and PD-L1 in monocytes from tuberculosis patients as compared to controls. Aberrant expression normalized during anti-mycobacterial treatment and also CD33 expression decreased markedly. Notably, higher CD33, CD40 and CD64 expression was induced in reference monocytes when cultured in the presence of plasma samples from tuberculosis patients as compared to controls. STAT signalling pathways were affected by the aberrant plasma milieu and higher levels of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation was found in tuberculosis plasma-treated reference monocytes. Importantly, high pSTAT3 levels were associated with high CD33 expression and pSTAT5 correlated with CD40 as well as CD64 expression. These results suggested plasma milieu effects with potential implications on monocyte phenotype and function in acute tuberculosis.

However, research has still not answered the key question regarding the dimensions of big poverty data analytics (BPDA) capabilities for creative service offerings nor their effects on economic and social outcomes. This study fills this gap by conducting a two-phase Delphi study and two rounds of surveys focusing on a globally leading microcredit institute in a developing country. The study conceptualizes management (analytics climate, cross-functional integration), platform (technology and data), and talent (pattern spotting and market ambidexterity) capabilities as the dimensions of BPDA capability. It further investigates creative service offerings (meaningfulness and novelty) as the mediator between BPDA-new service performance (economic outcome from the firm's end) as well as BPDA-quality of life (social outcome from consumer's end). Our research advances, first, the microfoundational view of dynamic capability (DC) theory in the emerging data-driven innovation paradigm by specifically identifying the complementary and co-specialization attributes of six microfoundations (i.e., analytics climate, cross-functional integration, data, technology, pattern spotting, and ambidexterity). In addition to DC, our study extends social innovation literature by establishing the connection between the instrument (BPDA capability) and outcome view (quality of life) of social innovation to tackle grand challenges in the developing world. Finally, our study extends creativity theory by introducing creative service offerings as a mediator and highlighting its role in the novel and meaningful solutions to social problems. Overall, this study is a pioneer in conceptualizing and empirically validating a research model that uncovers the potentially complex nuances between BPDA capability-creative offerings and innovation outcomes to tackle the grand challenge of poverty. Its findings are scholarly significant and executive worthy and constitute a major advancement in extant studies regarding how creative services are developed using BPDA and their impact on the firm's profitability and consumer well-being.

The tune of the donor (F8) conjugated length can be detected from the red shift in absorption spectra when TiO2 NPs and SiO2 NPs are added, as well as an increase in emission intensity of the donor. The addition of acceptors (MEH-PPV or MDMO-PPV-DMP) to the donor results in a new absorption peak at 510 nm, which increases when TiO2 NPs and SiO2 NPs or STNC are incorporated into the ternary hybrid. The incorporation of STNC into F8 is anticipated to reduce the donor energy bandgap and improve the energy transfer from F8 to both acceptors. Moreover, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is improved in the ternary hybrid, as evidenced by enhanced emission spectra of the donor and both acceptors, increased broadness of photoluminescence excitation spectra, and shifting blue color toward white region. The ternary hybrid with STNC-based organic light-emitting diode shows superior current and turn-on voltage compared to other devices, which is likely due to its superior FRET.

Coalescence of Sessile Polymer Droplets: A Molecular Dynamics Study	MACROMOLECULAR THEORY AND SIMULATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						droplet coalescence; droplet dynamics; molecular dynamics simulation; polymer chains	BRUSHES; DROPS	Droplet coalescence is ubiquitous in nature and, at the same time key to various technologies, such as inkjet printing. Herein, this study reports on the coalescence of polymer droplets with different chain lengths coalescing on substrates of different wettability. By means of molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained model, it is found that the rate of bridge growth is higher in the case of droplets with smaller contact angles (more wettable substrates) and decreases with the increase of the chain length of the polymers. Different behavior is also identified in the dynamics of the approach of the two droplets during coalescence with the substrate wettability playing a more important role compared to the chain length of the polymers. While the dynamics of the droplet are greatly affected by the latter parameters, the density profile and flow patterns remain the same for the different cases. Thus, this study anticipates that it provides further insights into the coalescence of liquid polymer droplets on solid substrates with implications for relevant technologies.

The international scandal of defective asparaginase: A blight on children with cancer	PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER			English	Article						asparaginase; cancer; children; defective; events		Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the commonest form of cancer in children and adolescents worldwide, and asparaginase is an essential component of successful chemotherapy for this disease associated with long-term survival rates often exceeding 90% in high-income countries. Demonstrably defective preparations of asparaginase, distributed from China and India, increase the burden of morbidity and mortality, reducing attainable survival rates. This adverse outcome is enabled by inadequate regulation and oversight, especially in resource-poor settings in low- and middle-income countries where the great majority of children and adolescents with cancer live. The pediatric oncology community must rise to the challenge.	[Barr, Ronald D.

Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common type of organ damage which occurs in SLE patients and is characterized by recurrent proteinuria. Activation of B lymphocytes can lead to refractory LN, which is an important pathogenic factor in SLE. B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are predominantly produced by myeloid cells (monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, etc) to regulate B lymphocyte function. Telitacicept was the first dual-targeting biological drug which targeted both BLyS and APRIL. Telitacicept has passed a phase II clinical trial and has since been approved for the treatment of SLE. Case PresentationWe report a case of SLE confirmed by renal biopsy as proliferative lupus nephritis (PLN) with massive proteinuria, which was treated with telitacicept (European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology 2019 standard). During the 19 months of follow-up, the patient's renal function was stable, massive proteinuria was relieved, and creatinine and blood pressure did not increase. ConclusionsDuring the 19 months of telitacicept treatment (160 mg once weekly), PLN reduced blood system damage and proteinuria without increasing the risk of infection.

Although raising the temperature helps in tumor ablation, it frequently leads to severe side effects. Therefore, improving the therapeutic response and promoting healing are critical considerations in the development of PTT. Here, we proposed a gas-mediated energy remodeling strategy to improve mild PTT efficacy while minimizing side effects. In the proof-of-concept study, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug-based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor was developed to provide a sustained supply of H2S to tumor sites, serving as an adjuvant to PTT. This approach proved to be highly effective in disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain, inhibiting ATP generation, and reducing the overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which ultimately amplified the therapeutic outcome. With the ability to reverse tumor thermotolerance, this strategy delivered a greatly potent antitumor response, achieving complete tumor ablation in a single treatment while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. Thus, it holds great promise to be a universal solution for overcoming the limitations of PTT and may serve as a valuable paradigm for the future clinical translation of photothermal nanoagents.

J	Dong, XW; Li, A; Yan, YY; Wang, P				Dong, Xiaowen; Li, Ao; Yan, Yangyang; Wang, Ping			Enhanced mechanical and damping properties of carbon fiber/epoxy composites by introducing the microcapsule particles	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article; Early Access						carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites; damping properties; mechanical properties; microcapsule particles reinforced	EPOXY; NANOPARTICLES	Because of the high strength, high modulus, and lightweight, carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites have been extensively used in aerospace and high-speed aircraft. In the present study, a high damping carbon fiber/epoxy (CF/EP) composites reinforced by microcapsule particles is prepared on the premise of guaranteeing the mechanical properties of CF/EP composites. Through flexural tests, interlayer shear tests, scanning electron microscopy, and vibration damping tests, the impacts of different components of microcapsules on the mechanical and damping properties of CF/EP are investigated. The microcapsule particles are composed of a polyurethane shell and internal silicone oil. The results demonstrate that the flexural, interlaminar shear properties and damping properties of CF/EP composites are effectively enhanced by appropriate amount of microcapsule particles. When the content is 3 vol%, the flexural strength of CF/EP composites is elevated by 1.68% with 734.392 MPa. In addition, the interlaminar shear strength of CF/EP composites is elevated by 4.91%, which is 42.8 MPa. Besides, the damping properties of CF/EP composites increase with the increasing content of microcapsule particles. When the content of microcapsule particles is 8 vol%, the damping ratio of CF/EP composites is elevated by 39.51%, which is 3.22%.

However, as quinidine is also a substrate of CYP3A4 and P-gp, it is susceptible to DDIs involving these proteins. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling can help to mechanistically assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes of a drug and has proven its usefulness in predicting even complex interaction scenarios. The objectives of the presented work were to develop a PBPK model of quinidine and to integrate the model into a comprehensive drug-drug(-gene) interaction (DD(G)I) network with a diverse set of CYP3A4 and P-gp perpetrators as well as CYP2D6 and P-gp victims. The quinidine parent-metabolite model including 3-hydroxyquinidine was developed using pharmacokinetic profiles from clinical studies after intravenous and oral administration covering a broad dosing range (0.1-600 mg). The model covers efflux transport via P-gp and metabolic transformation to either 3-hydroxyquinidine or unspecified metabolites via CYP3A4. The 3-hydroxyquinidine model includes further metabolism by CYP3A4 as well as an unspecific hepatic clearance. Model performance was assessed graphically and quantitatively with greater than 90% of predicted pharmacokinetic parameters within two-fold of corresponding observed values. The model was successfully used to simulate various DD(G)I scenarios with greater than 90% of predicted DD(G)I pharmacokinetic parameter ratios within two-fold prediction success limits. The presented network will be provided to the research community and can be extended to include further perpetrators, victims, and targets, to support investigations of DD(G)Is.

We leveraged these rich data to systematically characterize venetoclax PK and assess covariate effects with population PK modeling. Plasma concentration-time data were pooled from 3016 subjects enrolled in 41 phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies, including patients from 9 indications and healthy volunteers. A nonlinear mixed-effect model was developed. Covariates were evaluated with full covariate modeling approach. A 2-compartment model with 3 transit absorption compartments described the data well. The impact of moderate and strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition on apparent clearance (CL/F), female sex on apparent volume of distribution, food effect on relative bioavailability, and dose nonlinearity was confirmed. Newly identified covariate effects include 48% lower CL/F in subjects with severe hepatic impairment, 61% higher bioavailability in Asian subjects. When multiple CYP3A inhibitors are taken simultaneously, a 49% decrease in CL/F was estimated with multiple moderate inhibitors, more substantial than the 22% decrease of a single moderate inhibitor. An 85% decrease in CL/F was indicated when at least 1 strong CYP3A inhibitor was taken in combination, comparable to that of a single strong inhibitor. A venetoclax cross-indication population PK model with improved absorption-phase characterization was developed. Covariate analyses suggested lower CL/F for subjects with severe hepatic impairment and higher bioavailability in Asian subjects. Further decrease in CL/F was indicated when multiple moderate CYP3A inhibitors are present, compared to a single moderate inhibitor.	[Gong, Jingqi Q.

Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: In total, 227 young adults (18-44 years old) with T2DM at two hospitals in Beijing completed the questionnaires. The Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities (SDSCA) was used, along with additional questionnaires about diabetes self-efficacy, attitude, diabetes distress, diabetes knowledge, coping styles and social support. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore the related factors of self-management among the young patients. Results: The scores for the SDSCA in diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing, foot care and medication taking were (4.16 +/- 1.51), (3.46 +/- 2.50), (2.28 +/- 2.24), (1.08 +/- 1.84) and (6.09 +/- 1.88), respectively. Stepwise multiple linear regression showed that fasting blood-glucose value was significantly associated with self-management behaviours of diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing and medication taking. Self-efficacy was significantly associated with self-management behaviours of diet, exercise and foot care. Diabetes distress, diabetes-related social activity, confrontation, education, duration of T2DM, treatment modalities and diabetes knowledge were associated with the one or two dimensions of SDSCA in the young adults with T2DM.

To investigate the effect of HPSS, the threading dislocation densities (TDDs) of AlN films grown simultaneously on HPSS and flat sapphire substrate (FSS) are analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The corresponding TDD is measured to be 4.38 x 10(8) cm(-2) for the AlN sample grown on HPSS, which is significantly lower than the value of 1.48 x 10(9) cm(-2) on the FSS. The usability of the AlN/HPSS template for deep ultraviolet (DUV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is proven by growth of AlGaN-based LED structure emitting at 278 nm with single peak emission in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition reactor. The light output power of flip-chip LED grown and fabricated on AlN/HPSS template is enhanced by a factor of 1.25 when compared with LED on AlN/FSS template at 350 mA injecting current. These results suggest that the high-quality AlN template grown on properly designed HPSS by HVPE can make a significant contribution toward the realization of highly efficient nitride-based DUV-LEDs.

However, research on midkine-psoriasis relationship remains limited. The objective of this study was to detect midkine expression in psoriasis and investigate its potential role in the disease. Midkine expression was measured using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Effects of midkine on HaCaT cell proliferation, VEGF-A production and signalling pathways were assessed using CCK8, RT-PCR and WB. Scratch and in vitro tube formation tests were used to evaluate the effects of HaCaT-cell-activated midkine on the migration and tube formation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. Murine psoriasiform models were injected with midkine recombinant protein and midkine monoclonal antibody to investigate skin lesions, tissue sections and dermal microvessel density. Levels of midkine significantly increased in both lesions and serum of patients with psoriasis. Serum expression of midkine decreased after treatment and a positive correlation was found between midkine and disease severity. Midkine promoted HaCaT cell proliferation and VEGF-A production. The Notch2/HES1/JAK2-STAT5A pathway expression increased after midkine treatment of HaCaT cells. The supernatant of HaCaT cells treated with midkine promoted HMEC-1 migration and angiogenesis in vitro. Recombinant midkine protein exacerbated psoriasiform lesions with increased expressions of VEGF-A and microvessel density, while midkine monoclonal antibody alleviated psoriasis lesions. Midkine may have a significant impact on psoriasis angiogenesis by regulating VEGF-A expression through the Notch2/HES1/JAK2-STAT5A pathway, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for psoriasis treatment.

J	Li, Q; Liu, TT; Liu, Z; Chai, YJ				Li, Qing; Liu, Tingting; Liu, Zhen; Chai, Yanjie			Emotionally intelligent virtual tour guide in handling group conflicts: Effect on user outcomes	COMPUTER ANIMATION AND VIRTUAL WORLDS			English	Article						conflict resolution; emotional intelligence; group emotional intelligence; rapport; virtual agents		An effective virtual agent can serve humans complete task-based work efficaciously and manage interpersonal relationships with humans judiciously. This article investigates the effectiveness of emotional intelligence (EI) of a virtual agent taking over the role of a virtual tour guide (VTGuide) in a desktop application when witnessing a personal conflict between a human user and two virtual agents participating in the tour (the human user was ignored by the agents). A within-subject experiment is conducted to verify the validity of EI. Participants rate VTGuides (with or without EI) on conflict handling and report their feelings during the interaction. In addition, objective behavioral data of users are recorded, including facial expressions and textual sentiment, to assess the perception of rapport. The results show that an emotionally intelligent VTGuide performs an agreeable behavior system (e.g., nodding, eye contact, friendly facial expressions), comforting verbal strategy (e.g., distracting attention, mediating between conflicting parties), and positive paralinguistic cues (e.g., smiling textual emojis). It can effectively mitigate intra-group conflicts and maintain interpersonal relationships. Thus, demonstrating a stronger sense of EI can better transmit engagement, interest, understanding, and emotional feedback in complex relationships.

There are limitations to using traditional logistic regression models when assessing the model performance of comorbidity measures to predict in-hospital mortality. Meanwhile, the use of novel machine-learning methods is growing rapidly. In 2021, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality published new guidelines for using the Present-on-Admission (POA) indicator from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, for coding comorbidities to predict in-hospital mortality from the Elixhauser's comorbidity measurement method. We compared the model performance of logistic regression, elastic net model, and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict in-hospital mortality from Elixhauser's measures under the updated POA guidelines. In this retrospective analysis, 1,810,106 adult Medicare inpatient admissions from six US states admitted after September 23, 2017, and discharged before April 11, 2019 were extracted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data warehouse. The POA indicator was used to distinguish pre-existing comorbidities from complications that occurred during hospitalization. All models performed well (C-statistics >0.77). Elastic net method generated a parsimonious model, in which there were five fewer comorbidities selected to predict in-hospital mortality with similar predictive power compared to the logistic regression model. ANN had the highest C-statistics compared to the other two models (0.800 vs. 0.791 and 0.791). Elastic net model and AAN can be applied successfully to predict in-hospital mortality.

Although research focuses predominantly on aspects like collaboration within and organization of these spaces, little research has shed light on the development process of the PIP itself. This paper aims to contribute to innovation literature by identifying essential dimensions for the design and sustainable operation of PIPs. We use and transfer conceptual knowledge and empirical evidence in an iterative taxonomy development process. Five iterations were performed: (1) initial screening of PIPs, (2) an expert workshop, systematic literature reviews on (3) platform classifications and (4) on platform-mediated value creation, and (5) a taxonomy evaluation by practitioners. The resulting PIP taxonomy consists of 18 design dimensions summarized in five groups: physical architecture, platform actors, key-value propositions, value creation and revenue logic. It contributes with (1) a tangible framework for PIP concept development building on established design dimensions from platform-, business model- and value creation literature. (2) It emphasizes criteria that require thorough reflection in the design phase (e.g., IP rights), enabling practitioners to identify and overcome critical issues early.

We report the burden of pancreatic cancer and its attributable risk factors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, from 1990 to 2019, by age, sex, and socio-demographic index. MethodsPublicly available data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study were used to report the incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to pancreatic cancer, as counts and age-standardized rates with 95% uncertainty intervals. ResultsIn 2019, pancreatic cancer had an age-standardized incidence rate of 5.3 and a death rate of 5.5 (per 100 000) in MENA, which have increased by 97.5% and 93.4%, respectively, since 1990. There were 563.6 thousand DALYs attributable to pancreatic cancer in 2019, with an age-standardized DALY rate of 123.0, which has increased by 84.9% since 1990. The highest number of incident cases was found in the 60-64 and 65-69 age groups, among male and female, respectively. In addition, the MENA/global DALY ratios were higher in all age groups for both sexes in 2019, than they were in 1990. There was a positive association between socio-demographic index and the burden of pancreatic cancer. Smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index were responsible for 19.2%, 9.3%, and 9.3% of the attributable DALYs in 2019, respectively. ConclusionsThere was a clear and substantial increase in the burden of pancreatic cancer in the MENA region. Prevention programs should be implemented in the region that target these three risk factors.

Men and women differ in their interest and willingness to participate in exercise and sports science research	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS			English	Article						biomedical research; exercise; men's health; physical fitness testing; psychology; sports; sports medicine; women's health	SEX-DIFFERENCES; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; GENDER DIFFERENCES; PREFERENCE; FEMALE; PAIN; QUESTIONNAIRE; PERSPECTIVE; EXPERIENCE; SOMATOTYPE	Unequal proportions of male and female participants in exercise research might be attributed, in part, to differences in interest and willingness to participate. We tested if men and women are equally interested and willing to undergo exercise research procedures and if they consider different factors when deciding to participate. Two samples completed an online survey. Sample 1 (129 men, 227 women) responded to advertisements on social media and survey-sharing web sites. Sample 2 (155 men, 504 women) was comprised of undergraduate psychology students. In both samples, men were significantly more interested to learn their muscle mass amount, running speed, jump height, and ball throwing ability, and more willing to receive electrical shocks, cycle or run until exhaustion, complete strength training that causes muscle soreness, and take muscle-building supplements (all p = 0.013, d = 0.23- 0.48). Women were significantly more interested to learn their flexibility, and more willing to complete surveys, participate in stretching and group aerobics interventions, and participate in home exercise with online instruction (all p = 0.021, d = 0.12- 0.71). Women rated the following significantly more important when deciding to participate: study's implications for society; personal health status; confidence in own abilities; potential anxiety during testing; type of research facility; time to complete study; and invasiveness, pain/discomfort, and possible side effects of procedures (all p < 0.05, d = 0.26- 0.81). Differences in interest and willingness to participate in research probably contribute to different proportions of men and women as participants in exercise research. Knowledge of these differences might help researchers develop recruitment strategies aimed at encouraging both men and women to participate in exercise studies.

We compared a variety of analytical methods motivated by a typical clinical problem of multimorbidity prognosis.Methods: We considered five methods: product (multiply marginal risks), dual-outcome (directly model the time until both events occur), multistate models (msm), and a range of copula and frailty models. We assessed calibration and discrimination under a variety of simulated data scenarios, varying outcome prevalence, and the amount of residual correlation. The simulation focused on model misspecification and statistical power. Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we compared model performance when predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes both occurring.Results: Discrimination was similar for all methods. The product method was poorly calibrated in the presence of residual correlation. The msm and dual-outcome models were the most robust to model misspecification but suffered a drop in performance at small sample sizes due to overfitting, which the copula and frailty model were less susceptible to. The copula and frailty model's performance were highly dependent on the underlying data structure. In the clinical example, the product method was poorly calibrated when adjusting for 8 major cardiovascular risk factors.Discussion: We recommend the dual-outcome method for predicting the risk of two survival outcomes both occurring. It was the most robust to model misspecification, although was also the most prone to overfitting. The clinical example motivates the use of the methods considered in this study.

Accelerated damp heat (85 degrees C/85% RH) studies are presented and it is shown that the hygroscopic hole-transporting PEDOT:PSS layer is the origin of device failure in the case of prototypical inverted solar cells. Complementary measurements unveil that under these conditions a decreased PEDOT:PSS work function along with areas of reduced electrical contact between active layer and hole-transport layer are the main factors for device degradation rather than a chemical reaction of water with the active layer. Replacements for PEDOT:PSS are explored and it is found that tungsten oxide (WO3) or phosphomolybdic acid (PMA)-materials that can be processed from benign solvents at room temperature-yields comparable performance as PEDOT:PSS and enhances the resilience of solar cells under damp heat. The stability trend follows the order PEDOT:PSS << WO3 < PMA, with PEDOT:PSS-based devices failing after few minutes, while PMA-based devices remain nearly pristine over several hours. PMA is thus proposed as a robust, solution-processable hole extraction layer that can act as a one to one replacement of PEDOT:PSS to achieve organic solar cells with significantly improved longevity.

The discovery of the dynamic and reversible regulatory mechanism of m(6)A has greatly promoted the development of m(6)A-led epitranscriptomics. However, the characterization of m(6)A in cotton fiber is still unknown. Here, we reveal the potential link between m(6)A modification and cotton fiber elongation by parallel m(6)A-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (m(6)A-seq) and RNA-seq analysis of fibers from the short fiber mutants Ligonliness-2 (Li-2) and wildtype (WT). This study demonstrated a higher level of m(6)A in the Li-2 mutant, with the enrichment of m(6)A modifications in the stop codon, 3'-untranslated region and coding sequence regions than in WT cotton. In the correlation analysis between genes containing differential m(6)A modifications and differentially expressed genes, we identified several genes that could potentially regulate fiber elongation, including cytoskeleton, microtubule binding, cell wall and transcription factors (TFs). We further confirmed that the methylation of m(6)A affected the mRNA stability of these fiber elongation-related genes including the TF GhMYB44, which showed the highest expression level in the RNA-seq data and m(6)A methylation in the m(6)A-seq data. Next, the overexpression of GhMYB44 reduces fiber elongation, whereas the silencing of GhMYB44 produces longer fibers. In summary, these results uncover that m(6)A methylation regulated the expression of genes related to fiber development by affecting mRNA's stability, ultimately affecting cotton fiber elongation.

In automated medical imagery diagnostic technique, due to presence of noise in medical images and use of single pre-trained model on low quality images, the existing deep network models cannot provide the optimal results with better accuracy. Hence, hybrid deep learning model of Xception model & Resnet50V2 model is proposed in this paper. This study suggests classifying X-ray images into three categories namely, normal, bacterial/viral infections and Covid positive. It utilizes CLAHE & BM3D techniques to improve visual clarity and reduce noise. Transfer learning method with variety of pre-trained models such as ResNet-50, Inception V3, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50V2, and Xception are used for better feature extraction and Chest X-ray image classification. The overfitting issue were resolved using K-fold cross validation. The proposed hybrid deep learning model results high accuracy of 97.8% which is better than existing techniques.

To date, there is no consensus on the management of RHT. Therefore, we aim to describe the clinical features, treatments, and outcomes of patients with simultaneous RHT and PE. MethodsThis is a retrospective, cross-sectional, and single-center study of hospitalized patients with central PE who had RHT visualized on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) from January 2012 to May 2022. We use descriptive statistics to describe their clinical features, treatments, and outcomes, including mechanical ventilation, major bleeding, inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay, and recurrent PE on follow-up. ResultsOf 433 patients with central PE who underwent TTE, nine patients (2%) had RHT. The median age was 63 years (range 29-87), most were African American (6/9), and females (5/9). All patients had evidence of RV dysfunction and received therapeutic anticoagulation. Eight patients received RHT-directed interventions, including systemic thrombolysis (2/9), catheter-directed suction embolectomy (4/9), and surgical embolectomy (2/9). Regarding outcomes, 4/9 patients were hemodynamically unstable, 8/9 were hypoxemic, and 2/9 were mechanically ventilated. The median length of hospital stay was six days (range 1-16). One patient died during hospital admission, and two patients had recurrent PE. ConclusionWe described the different therapeutic approaches and outcomes of patients with RHT treated in our institution. Our study adds valuable information to the literature, as there is no consensus on the treatment of RHT. HighlightsRight heart thrombus (RHT) was a rare finding in central pulmonary embolism.Most patients with RHT had evidence of RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.Most patients received RHT-directed therapies in addition to therapeutic anticoagulation.

J	KShkönen, K; Väänänen, A				Kahkonen, Kati; Vaananen, Antti			Labour analgesia by single shot spinal for any parturient?-A retrospective one-year single centre audit	ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article; Early Access						labour analgesia; spinal analgesia; sufentanil	INTRATHECAL SUFENTANIL; BUPIVACAINE; WOMEN	BackgroundSingle shot spinal (SSS) provides effective analgesia for multiparous parturients during advanced labour. Its utility in early labour or primiparous parturients may be limited by the insufficient duration of action. Regardless, SSS may offer a reasonable labour analgesia option in certain clinical scenarios. In this retrospective study, we analyse the failure rate of SSS analgesia by assessing pain after the SSS and by determining the need for additional analgesic interventions in primiparous or early-stage multiparous parturients compared to multiparous parturients in advanced labour (cervix = 6 cm).MethodsFollowing institutional ethical board approval, the patient files of all parturients receiving SSS analgesia during a 12-month period in a single centre were analysed for any recorded notes regarding recurrent pain or subsequent analgesia interventions (a new SSS, epidural, pudendal or paracervical bloc) as a marker for insufficient analgesia.ResultsA total of 88 primiparous and 447 multiparous parturients (cervix N = 131; cervix = 6 cm: N = 316) received SSS analgesia. The odds ratio for the insufficient duration of analgesia was 1.94 (1.08-3.48) in primiparous and 2.08 (1.25-3.46) in early-stage multiparous parturients compared to advanced multiparous labour (p < .01). Primiparous and early-stage multiparous parturients were also 2.20 (1.15-4.20) and 2.61 (1.50-4.55) times more likely, respectively, to receive new peripheral and/or neuraxial analgesic interventions during delivery (p < .01).ConclusionsSSS appears to provide adequate labour analgesia for the majority of parturients in whom it is used, including nulliparous and early-stage multiparous parturients. It remains a reasonable option in certain clinical scenarios, including resource-limited settings where epidural analgesia is unavailable.

Drawing on my experience of simultaneously being a sitting state senator and a university professor, I argue that while professional sociology is premised on and starts with skepticism, doubt, and criticism, public engagement as sociologists must, to a greater extent, be premised on reception and welcome of ideas. We need prosocial, courageous frameworks to realize the practical and ethical potential of sociology. Believing can do three things: it can help make our work more robust by exploring more ways of knowing (making us better scholars); it can help us create more and better connections with others doing such work (making us better organizers); and can help our social systems be more responsive and adaptive (it gives us better institutions). I outline how I see this happening.

Residual vulnerabilities to power side channel attacks of lightweight ciphers cryptography competition finalists	IET COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TECHNIQUES			English	Review						cryptography; internet of things; leakage currents; power consumption; security of data; telecommunication security	AUTHENTICATED ENCRYPTION	The protection of communications between Internet of Things (IoT) devices is of great concern because the information exchanged contains vital sensitive data. Malicious agents seek to exploit those data to extract secret information about the owners or the system. Power side channel attacks are of great concern on these devices because their power consumption unintentionally leaks information correlatable to the device's secret data. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of authenticated encryption with advanced data, in protecting communications with these devices. A comprehensive evaluation of the seven (out of 10) algorithm finalists of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) IoT lightweight cipher competition that do not integrate built-in countermeasures is proposed. The study shows that, nonetheless, they still present some residual vulnerabilities to power side channel attacks (SCA). For five ciphers, an attack methodology as well as the leakage function needed to perform correlation power analysis (CPA) is proposed. The authors assert that Ascon, Sparkle, and PHOTON-Beetle security vulnerability can generally be assessed with the security assumptions "Chosen ciphertext attack and leakage in encryption only, with nonce-misuse resilience adversary (CCAmL1)" and "Chosen ciphertext attack and leakage in encryption only with nonce-respecting adversary (CCAL1)", respectively. However, the security vulnerability of GIFT-COFB, Grain, Romulus, and TinyJambu can be evaluated more straightforwardly with publicly available leakage models and solvers. They can also be assessed simply by increasing the number of traces collected to launch the attack.

Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, MC CD25/CD2/CD30 expression, and presence of activating KIT mutations.Risk Stratification: Establishing SM subtype as per the International Consensus Classification/World Health Organization classification systems is an important first step. Patients either have indolent/smoldering SM (ISM/SSM) or advanced SM, including aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated myeloid neoplasm (SM-AMN), and mast cell leukemia. Identification of poor-risk mutations (i.e., ASXL1, RUNX1, SRSF2, NRAS) further refines the risk stratification. Several risk models are available to help assign prognosis in SM patients.Management: Treatment goals for ISM patients are primarily directed toward anaphylaxis prevention/symptom control/osteoporosis treatment. Patients with advanced SM frequently need MC cytoreductive therapy to reverse disease-related organ dysfunction. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (midostaurin, avapritinib) have changed the treatment landscape in SM. While deep biochemical, histological and molecular responses have been documented with avapritinib treatment, its efficacy as monotherapy against a multimutated AMN disease component in SM-AMN patients remains unclear. Cladribine continues to have a role for MC debulking, whereas interferon-a has a diminishing role in the TKI era. Treatment of SM-AMN primarily targets the AMN component, particularly if an aggressive disease such as acute leukemia is present. Allogeneic stem cell transplant has a role in such patients. Imatinib has a therapeutic role only in the rare patient with an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation.

Assessing social perceptions of rewilding approaches in Spain using traditional domestic livestock	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						abandoned agricultural landscapes; biology conservation; ecosystem services; restoration; Spain; stakeholder perception	WILDERNESS; ATTITUDES; REINTRODUCTION; CONSEQUENCES; ABANDONMENT; MANAGEMENT; EUROPE; AREAS	Rewilding is habitat restoration that attempts to return ecosystems to their state before human alterations were imposed. Rewilding might involve actions that are not desired by society. As a result, a compromised form of rewilding has been proposed that is generally known as rewilding lite, which involves some human intervention to achieve the goals of a more natural state of ecosystems that were historically disturbed by anthropogenic influences. Rewilding lite is gaining traction in Europe where marginal agriculture areas are being abandoned. We addressed a variant that we called livestock rewilding (LR) based on the use of herbivorous livestock species to restore ecological functions and trophic complexity (functional integrity) in abandoned agricultural landscapes. Our objective was to assess societal attitudes and awareness of LR in Spain based on the answers of 1,036 respondents of a self-selecting questionnaire of 27 closed-ended questions addressed to the general public using snowball sampling, conducted between March and July 2021. Seventy-five percent of the respondents supported LR but only on the condition of imposing minimum hazards to people, crops, and property. Ranchers were the least likely societal group to support LR (58%). Women had the greatest enthusiasm for LR (79% women vs. 71% men). Horses, donkeys, and goats were the most preferred species to be included in LR programs, with pigs as the least popular after cattle and sheep. There was support for the removal of excess individuals of rewilded livestock and for the use of their meat for human consumption, especially among male respondents. Respondents were reticent to accept mortality in LR populations caused by natural stochastic events and discriminated between livestock species for population control methods. Respondents preferred non-lethal methods of population control; involving hunters was a second choice. Some hunters were reluctant to participate in population control of rewilded livestock, especially if they had to pay, and were reticent to shoot equids but keen to shoot goats. There was general support among Spanish respondents for LR, though there were significant differences between societal groups in attitudes towards the type, species, and intensity of management required to minimize hazards to people's health, crops, and the environment. Livestock rewilding is a plausible tool for the restoration of trophic complexity in abandoned agricultural land in Spain that could be used to circumvent the introduction of allochthonous wild species.

However, its impact on the outcome of concurrent pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH) is controversial. ObjectivesDetermine whether dogs with PDH have longer survival after pituitary RT compared with dogs with nonhormonally active pituitary masses and to evaluate whether clinical, imaging, and RT variables affect survival. AnimalsNinety-four dogs divided into 2 groups: PDH and non-PDH, based on the presence of hypercortisolism. Forty-seven dogs were allocated to the PDH group and 47 to the non-PDH group. MethodsRetrospective cohort study in which clinical records of dogs undergoing RT for pituitary macroadenomas between 2008 and 2018 at 5 referral centers were retrospectively evaluated. ResultsSurvival was not statistically different between PDH and non-PDH groups (median survival time [MST], 590 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0-830 days and 738 days; 95% CI, 373-1103 days, respectively; P = .4). A definitive RT protocol was statistically associated with longer survival compared with a palliative protocol (MST 605 vs 262 days, P = .05). The only factor statistically associated with survival from multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was total radiation dose (Gy) delivered (P < .01). Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceNo statistical difference in survival was identified between the PDH and non-PDH groups, and longer survival was associated with higher Gy delivered.

Getting the bugs out of AI: Advancing ecological research on arthropods through computer vision	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Review						arthropod; computer vision; deep learning; ecology; foundation model; generative models; insects	TRAP IMAGES; DECLINE	Deep learning for computer vision has shown promising results in the field of entomology, however, there still remains untapped potential. Deep learning performance is enabled primarily by large quantities of annotated data which, outside of rare circumstances, are limited in ecological studies. Currently, to utilize deep learning systems, ecologists undergo extensive data collection efforts, or limit their problem to niche tasks. These solutions do not scale to region agnostic models. However, there are solutions that employ data augmentation, simulators, generative models, and self-supervised learning that can supplement limited labelled data. Here, we highlight the success of deep learning for computer vision within entomology, discuss data collection efforts, provide methodologies for optimizing learning from limited annotations, and conclude with practical guidelines for how to achieve a foundation model for entomology capable of accessible automated ecological monitoring on a global scale.

Evidence relating them to cognitive decline has been mixed. The objective was to determine whether sulfonylurea use was associated with a differential risk of dementia compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor use. Methods: Using administrative data from residents in Ontario, Canada, adults aged =66 years who were new users of a sulfonylurea or a DPP4 inhibitor from June 14, 2011, to March 31, 2021 entered this population-based retrospective cohort study. Dementia was ascertained using a validated algorithm for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Propensity-score weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and confidence intervals (CI) for time to incident dementia. The observation window started at 1 year after cohort entry to mitigate protopathic bias due to delayed diagnosis. The primary analysis used an intention-to-treat exposure definition. A separate propensity-score weighted analysis was conducted to explore within-class differences in dementia risk among sulfonylurea new users selected from the primary cohort. Results: Among 107,806 DPP4 inhibitor new users and 37,030 sulfonylurea new users, sulfonylureas compared with DPP4 inhibitors were associated with a higher risk of dementia (18.4/1000 person-years; aHR [95% CI] = 1.09 [1.04-1.15]) over a mean follow-up of 4.82 years from cohort entry. Glyburide compared to gliclazide exhibited a higher dementia risk (aHR [95% CI] = 1.17 [1.03-1.32]). Conclusion: New use of a sulfonylurea especially glyburide was associated with a higher dementia risk compared with new use of a DPP4 inhibitor in older adults with diabetes.

Vehicle Scanning Method for Bridges Enhanced by Dual Amplifiers	STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING			English	Article							DYNAMIC-RESPONSE; PASSING VEHICLE; DAMAGE DETECTION; MODE SHAPES; FUNDAMENTAL-FREQUENCY; IDENTIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION; EXTRACTION; EXCITATION	Dual-function amplifiers are proposed for the first time herein for enhancing the capability of a scanning test vehicle for bridges. To start, closed-form solutions are derived for the dynamic responses of the amplifier-vehicle-bridge system with a moving test vehicle. Then, the dynamic amplification factors of the amplifier and vehicle are presented for assessing the bridge/vehicle and vehicle/amplifier transmissibility. It was known that the spectrum of the vehicle may be hindered for extracting the bridge frequencies because of vehicle frequency and rough pavement. Two differentially tuned amplifiers are called on to tackle the problem: one (i.e., the vehicle damper) is to suppress the effect of vehicle's frequency, acting like the tuned mass damper (TMD), and the other (i.e., the bridge amplifier) is to enlarge the amplitude of bridge frequency of concern. Based on the parametric study, it is concluded that (1) the bridge amplifier performs better than the vehicle one in extracting bridge frequencies by increasing their visibility in the spectrum; (2) the effect of vehicle's frequency can be suppressed by tuning the vehicle damper such that it functions like a TMD of the vehicle; (3) by tuning the bridge amplifier to any of the first few bridge frequencies, the latter can be well detected even for rough pavement.

For complex underground structures (e.g., long tunnels and large caves), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be adaptive in acquiring images at multiple heights and angles with low operational costs. So far, UAV underground structural health monitoring has become mature for open-air surveying with rapid developments in robotic software and hardware. However, the UAV image acquisition for underground working conditions still faces a number of key challenges. This paper aims to provide an overview of UAV navigation techniques in confined dark spaces for geotechnical engineers, geologists, drone developers and other interdisciplinary researchers & professionals in the structural health monitoring field. It specifies the challenges for UAV application in underground space, mainly including lack of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, poor lighting conditions, weak features and obstacle avoidance and then followed by strategic solutions. For example, in light of poor GNSS signals, the fusion of multi-sensors (e.g., laser imaging, detection and ranging (LiDAR) and multi-cameras) can enhance localization accuracy in low-luminance underground conditions. To address obstacle avoidance, computer vision (CV)-based navigation algorithms (e.g., deep reinforced learning [DRL]) enable effective navigation in complex 3D spaces, but their adaptability is limited by arithmetic power and pre-training needs. The review of relevant previous studies concludes that further development for UAVs in underground space inspection may focus on operation in large-scale geometric inspection environments, obstacle avoidance, features and semantic recognition.

Genetic predisposition and immune dysfunction are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Notably, peripheral inflammatory disorders and neuroinflammation are associated with PD neuropathology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with inflammatory disorders due to hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Particularly, insulin resistance (IR) in T2DM promotes the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Thus, T2DM-induced inflammatory disorders predispose to the development and progression of PD, and their targeting may reduce PD risk in T2DM. Therefore, this narrative review aims to find the potential link between T2DM and PD by investigating the role of inflammatory signalling pathways, mainly the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) and the nod-like receptor pyrin 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. NF-kappa B is implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM, and activation of NF-kappa B with induction of neuronal apoptosis was also confirmed in PD patients. Systemic activation of NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the accumulation of a-synuclein and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Increasing a-synuclein in PD patients enhances NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of interleukin (IL)-1 beta followed by the development of systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. In conclusion, activation of the NF-kappa B/NLRP3 inflammasome axis in T2DM patients could be the causal pathway in the development of PD. The inflammatory mechanisms triggered by activated NLRP3 inflammasome lead to pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and the development of T2DM. Therefore, attenuation of inflammatory changes by inhibiting the NF-kappa B/NLRP3 inflammasome axis in the early T2DM may reduce future PD risk.

Cholinergic neurotransmission affects respiratory rhythmogenic neurons and inhibitory glycinergic neurons in the preBotC. Acetylcholine has been extensively investigated given that cholinergic fibers and receptors are present and functional in the preBotC, are important in sleep/wake cycling, and modulate inspiratory frequency through its action on preBotC neurons. Despite its role in modulating inspiratory rhythm, the source of acetylcholine input to the preBotC is not known. In the present study, we used retrograde and anterograde viral tracing approaches in transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase driven by the choline acetyltransferase promoter to identify the source of cholinergic inputs to the preBotC. Surprisingly, we observed very few, if any, cholinergic projections originating from the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/PPT), two main cholinergic, state-dependent systems long hypothesized as the main source of cholinergic inputs to the preBotC. On the contrary, we identified glutamatergic and GABAergic/glycinergic neurons in the PPT/LDT that send projections to the preBotC. Although these neurons contribute minimally to the direct cholinergic modulation of preBotC neurons, they could be involved in state-dependent regulation of breathing. Our data also suggest that the source of cholinergic inputs to the preBotC appears to originate from cholinergic neurons in neighboring regions of the medulla, the intermediate reticular formation, the lateral paragigantocellularis, and the nucleus of the solitary tract.

J	Butcher, JD				Butcher, Jack D.			All Containment and No Engagement: Australia's Contemporary Policy towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND HISTORY			English	Article; Early Access							MIDDLE POWER; DIPLOMACY; DPRK	Australia's interactions with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), henceforth known as North Korea, have ebbed and flowed throughout their seventy-five-year history. In times of detente on the Korean Peninsula, Australia actively engaged North Korea and sought to facilitate its integration into the international system. However, during the recent detente in 2018-2019, Canberra broke with tradition and watched on as Trump, Moon, and Kim sought to negotiate a deal towards Pyongyang's denuclearisation. Why has Australia not followed its security partners and engaged, despite being an Indo-Pacific middle power and an advocate for non-proliferation? Answers to this question remain unknown in the international relations literature. Therefore, I conducted process tracing and identified seven "critical junctures" in Australia's relationship with North Korea while analysing its responses using middle power theory. Australia's preference for non-engagement is due to a shift towards a "maximum pressure" policy reliant on sanctions, reducing incentives to engage. This stems from a normative objection to Pyongyang's violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and limited material capabilities to persuade North Korea to denuclearise unilaterally. I aim to give an up-to-date account of Australia-North Korea relations and draw attention to a neglected area in Australia's non-proliferation policy.

Herein, a novel melanin-integrated structural color hybrid hydrogel patches for wound healing is presented. Such hybrid hydrogel patches are fabricated by infusing asiatic acid (AA)-loaded low melting-point agarose (AG) pregel into the melanin nanoparticles (MNPs)-integrated fish gelatin inverse opal film. In this system, MNPs not only impart the hybrid hydrogels with properties of photothermal antibacterial and antioxidant, but also improve the visibility of structural colors by providing an inherent dark background. Besides, the photothermal effect of MNPs under near-infrared irradiation can also trigger liquid transformation of AG component in hybrid patch, resulting in the controllable release of its loaded proangiogenic AA. Attracting, this drug release induced refractive index variations in the patch can be detected as visible structural color shifting, which can be used to monitor their delivery processes. Benefiting from these features, the hybrid hydrogel patches are demonstrated to achieve excellent therapeutic effects for in vivo wound treatment. Thus, it is believed that the proposed melanin-integrated structural color hybrid hydrogels are valuable as multifunctional patches for clinical applications.

Optical Properties of Electrochemically Gated La<sub>1-</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Sr<i><sub>x</sub></i>CoO<sub>3-<i>δ</i></sub> as a Topotactic Phase-Change Material	ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						active metasurfaces; electrolyte gating; insulator-insulator transitions; metal-insulator transitions; mid-infrared; perovskite oxide; phase-change photonic materials	SPIN-STATE; METAMATERIAL; NONVOLATILE; ABSORBER; LACOO3; INDEX; FILMS	Materials with tunable infrared refractive index changes have enabled active metasurfaces for novel control of optical circuits, thermal radiation, and more. Ion-gel-gated epitaxial films of the perovskite cobaltite La1-xSrxCoO3-delta (LSCO) with 0.00 <= x <= 0.70 offer a new route to significant, voltage-tuned, nonvolatile refractive index modulation for infrared active metasurfaces, shown here through Kramers-Kronig-consistent dispersion models, structural and electronic transport characterization, and electromagnetic simulations before and after electrochemical reduction. As-grown perovskite films are high-index insulators for x < 0.18 but lossy metals for x > 0.18, due to a percolation insulator-metal transition. Positive-voltage gating of LSCO transistors with x > 0.18 reveals a metal-insulator transition from the metallic perovskite phase to a high-index (n > 2.5), low-loss insulating phase, accompanied by a perovskite to oxygen-vacancy-ordered brownmillerite transformation at high x. At x < 0.18, despite nominally insulating character, the LSCO films undergo remarkable refractive index changes to another lower-index, lower-loss insulating perovskite state with Delta n > 0.6. In simulations of plasmonic metasurfaces, these metal-insulator and insulator-insulator transitions support significant, varied mid-infrared reflectance modulation, thus framing electrochemically gated LSCO as a diverse library of room-temperature phase-change materials for applications including dynamic thermal imaging, camouflage, and optical memories.

Our previous study on three beta-propeller mutations, namely G128S, S287L, and G357S, showed variable defects in protein transport correlated with the patient's clinical phenotypes. Pulse-chase experiments revealed differences in alpha IIb beta 3 complex maturation among the three mutations. Hence, the current study aims to correlate conformational changes caused by each one of them. Evolutionary conservation analysis, stability analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations of the three mutant structures were carried out. Stability analysis revealed that, while G128S and G357S mutations destabilized the beta-propeller structure, S287L retained the stability. Wild-type and mutant beta-propeller structures, when subjected to molecular dynamics simulations, confirmed that G128S and G357S were both destabilizing in nature when compared with the wild-type and S287L based on several parameters studied, like RMSD, RMSF, Rg, FEL, PCA, secondary structure, and hydrogen bonds. In our previous study, we demonstrated that mutant S287L alpha IIb beta 3 complexes were more stable than the wild-type alpha IIb beta 3 complexes, as evidenced in pulse-chase experiments. These findings corroborate variable intracellular fates of mutant alpha IIb beta 3 complexes as a result of these beta-propeller mutations.

Currently, no study has compared the effectiveness of these two methods. This study aimed to compare the efficiency of enteral hydration using CF and B to correct water, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances in cows. MethodsProtocols for the induction of dehydration were applied twice to eight healthy cows, with an interval of 1 week. In a crossover design, two types of enteral hydration were performed using the same electrolyte solution and volume equal to 12% of bodyweight (BW): CF (10 mL/kg/h, between 0 and 12 hours) and B (6% BW, twice, at 0 and 6 hours). Clinical and blood variables were determined at -24, 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours and compared using repeated-measures ANOVA. ResultsInduced moderate dehydration and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis were corrected after 12 hours using the two hydration methods, with no differences observed between the methods. LimitationsThe study was conducted with induced rather than natural imbalances, so the findings should be interpreted cautiously. ConclusionEnteral CF hydration is as effective as B hydration in reversing dehydration and correcting electrolyte and acid-base imbalances.

J	Devitt, M; Porter, B				Devitt, Michael; Porter, Brian			Two sorts of biological kind terms: The cases of 'rice' and 'Rio de janeiro Myrtle'	PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access							ESSENTIALISM; SEMANTICS	Experiments have led some philosophers to conclude that the reference determination of natural kind terms is neither simply descriptive nor simply causal-historical. Various theories have been aired to account for this, including ambiguity, hybrid, and different-idiolects theories. Devitt and Porter (2021) hypothesized that some terms are covered by one theory, some another, with a place for all the proposed theories. The present paper tests hypotheses that the term 'Rio de Janeiro Myrtle' is simply causal-historical but the term 'rice' is hybrid. For, whereas the former term is of scientific but little practical interest, the latter is not: rice is a significant part of the human diet. So, we predicted there would be two factors to the reference determination of 'rice': a superficial-descriptive one and a deep-causal one. Our experiments confirmed these hypotheses using the methods of elicited production and truth value judgments. We take our results to support the hybrid Theory of 'rice' rather than the ambiguity or different-idiolects theory. We were not testing 'myrtle' but, surprisingly, our results implied that 'myrtle' was partly descriptive and so like 'rice' but not 'Rio de Janeiro Myrtle'. A follow-up experiment confirmed these puzzling results. More investigation is needed.

J	Haynes, J				Haynes, Jason			Human Trafficking: Iconic Victims, Folk Devils and the Nationality and Borders Act 2022	MODERN LAW REVIEW			English	Article							DOMESTIC WORKERS; CONSTRUCTION; SEX	On 28 April 2022, the Westminster Parliament passed the controversial Nationality and Borders Act. The Act is the single biggest overhaul of the UK's immigration system in decades. The Act aims to deter illegal entry into the UK; remove more easily those with no right to be in the UK; and increase the overall fairness of the system. Notwithstanding these seemingly laudable objectives, however, this article argues that the Act represents a retrograde step in the protection of victims of human trafficking. Relying upon Nils Christie's 'ideal/iconic victims' and Stanley Cohen's 'folk devils' critique, the article contends that, in an age of heightened securitisation and moral panics, the Act will create 'folk devils' of victims of trafficking who do not self-identify, and unduly penalise victims of trafficking who have committed offences in the course, or as a consequence, of being trafficked.

PERSONALITY AND MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access							CLINICIAN ATTITUDES; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; THERAPY; ME	Research suggests there is a widespread stigma among clinicians towards patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and that this contributes to poor treatment outcomes. Given the influence of learning environments in shaping perceptions, this study investigated the attitude of South Australian psychiatry trainees towards patients with BPD. A questionnaire was distributed to 89 South Australian doctors, from both The Adelaide Prevocational Psychiatry Program (TAPPP) and psychiatry trainees of The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP). This questionnaire investigated the domains of treatment optimism, clinician attitude and empathy towards patients with BPD. Results indicated that psychiatry trainees near the end of training scored significantly lower across all domains, indicating a more negative perception of patients with BPD, when compared to early- and mid-stage trainees. This study identifies a need to understand why trainees closer to qualifying as psychiatrists have increased stigma towards patients with BPD. Improved education and training surrounding patients with BPD is warranted to reduce negative stigma and improve clinical outcomes.

Nowadays, breast cancer is an extremely heterogeneous disease and is known as the leading cause of death among women worldwide. The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer have been increasing gradually for the past decades. Nowadays, common treatments for breast cancer are chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. The most common targets in breast cancer treatment are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and estrogen receptors. The literature suggests that several targets/pathways are also involved in the development of breast cancer, that is, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR), histone deacetylase (HDAC), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), PD-L1, and aromatase inhibitors. Meanwhile, the study of breast cancer is a hot topic in the current scenario of basic/clinical research. This review article provides information on different targets associated with breast cancer and summarizes the progress of current research on synthesized inhibitors as anti-breast cancer agents from 2015 to 2021. The review aims to provide structure-activity relationship and docking studies for designing novel compounds for breast cancer therapy.

The role of molecular diagnostic testing for hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LABORATORY HEMATOLOGY			English	Review						genetic counseling; hemoglobinopathy; molecular diagnosis; thalassemia	BETA-THALASSEMIA; ALPHA-THALASSEMIA; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; RAPID DETECTION; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; CLINICAL PRESENTATION; PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS; FETAL-HEMOGLOBIN; GENE-MUTATIONS; DELETIONS	Hemoglobin disorders are among the most common genetic diseases worldwide. Molecular diagnosis is helpful in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain and for genetic counseling. Protein-based diagnostic techniques are frequently adequate for initial diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing is pursued in some cases, particularly when a definitive diagnosis is not possible and especially for the purpose of assessing genetic risk for couples wanting to have children. The expertise available in the clinical hematology laboratory is essential for the diagnosis of patients with hemoglobin abnormalities. Initial diagnoses are made using protein-based techniques such as electrophoresis and chromatography. Based on these findings, genetic risk to an individual's offspring can be assessed. In the setting of beta-thalassemia and other beta-globin disorders, coincident alpha-thalassemia may be difficult to diagnose, which can have potentially serious consequences. In addition, unusual forms of beta-thalassemia caused by deletions in the beta-globin locus cannot be definitively characterized using standard techniques. Molecular diagnostic testing has an important role in the diagnosis of hemoglobin disorders and is important in the setting of genetic counseling. Molecular testing also has a role in prenatal diagnosis to identify fetuses affected by severe hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias.

Understanding farmers' barriers to health and mental health-related help-seeking: The development, factor structure, and reliability of the Farmer Help-Seeking Scale	JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access						agriculture; barriers; farming; health; help-seeking	SOUTH-AUSTRALIA; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; RISK-FACTORS; SUICIDE; STRESS; AVOIDANCE; RIVERLAND; RETENTION; ATTITUDES; LITERACY	PurposeThe aim of this research was to develop a contextually and culturally appropriate scale to assess farmers' barriers to health-related help-seeking. MethodsAn initial pool of items was developed from the academic literature and input from an expert panel of farmers, rural academics, and rural clinicians. A draft 32-item questionnaire was then developed and sent to farmers registered with FARMbase, which is an Australian national farmer database. FindingsTwo hundred and seventy-four farmers completed the draft questionnaire (93.7% male, 73.7% aged 56-75 years). An exploratory factor analysis identified 6 factors; "Health Issues are a Low Priority," "Concerns about Stigma," "Structural Health System Barriers," "Minimization and Normalization," "Communication Barriers," and "Continuity of Care.". Test-retest reliability was examined with a further 10 farmers (90% male, Mean age = 57, SD = 5.91), who completed the questionnaire twice (at 2- to 3-week intervals). Results indicated moderate-good test-retest reliability. ConclusionsThe resulting 24-item Farmer Help-Seeking Scale provides a measure of help-seeking that is specifically designed to capture the unique context, culture, and attitudes that can interfere with farmers' help-seeking, and inform the development of strategies to increase health-service utilization in this at-risk group.

In this work, pea protein-naringin complexes (PP-NG complexes) were constructed to stabilise the Pickering emulsion and reduce the bitterness of naringin. Sensory evaluation results showed that the bitterness and after-bitterness of the PP-NG complexes were reduced by 77.78% and 75.99% compared with 1 mm naringin respectively. For the PP-NG complexes, the fluorescence spectra results showed that the endogenous fluorescence intensity of pea protein decreased with the naringin concentration increased (0-2 mm), and each pea protein molecule bound to one naringin molecule. Results obtained via thermodynamic analysis molecular docking demonstrated that naringin had an excellent binding affinity (-7.4 kcal mol(-1)) with pea protein and could form five hydrophobic bonds and four hydrogen bonds with pea protein. These findings would provide a new idea for the masking of bitterness and the evolution of Pickering emulsions stabilised by the protein-polyphenol nanoparticles.

The "vicious cycle" between osteoclasts and breast cancer cells plays an essential role in osteolytic bone metastasis from breast cancer. In order to inhibit bone metastasis from breast cancer, NIR-II photoresponsive bone-targeting nanosystems (CuP@PPy-ZOL NPs) are designed and synthesized. CuP@PPy-ZOL NPs can trigger the photothermal-enhanced Fenton response and photodynamic effect to enhance the photothermal treatment (PTT) effect and thus achieve synergistic anti-tumor effect. Meanwhile, they exhibit a photothermal enhanced ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and promote osteoblast differentiation, which reshaped the bone microenvironment. CuP@PPy-ZOL NPs effectively inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells and bone resorption in the in vitro 3D bone metastases model of breast cancer. In a mouse model of breast cancer bone metastasis, CuP@PPy-ZOL NPs combined with PTT with NIR-II significantly inhibited the tumor growth of breast cancer bone metastases and osteolysis while promoting bone repair to achieve the reversal of osteolytic breast cancer bone metastases. Furthermore, the potential biological mechanisms of synergistic treatment are identified by conditioned culture experiments and mRNA transcriptome analysis. The design of this nanosystem provides a promising strategy for treating osteolytic bone metastases.

In particular, future climate change may have disproportional impacts to these ecosystems. Evaluating the combined effects of abiotic changes and biotic interactions simultaneously is important for forecasting the range of future outcomes. This information is necessary to aid conservation decision-making.We use field data to estimate population demographic parameters for an exemplary high-elevation amphibian species, the federally endangered Shenandoah salamander Plethodon shenandoah. These parameters were entered into a Markov projection model which we used to forecast the future population status of the Shenandoah salamander.We found that if the population maintains its current site colonization and persistence rates, it is at the risk of extinction that could be exacerbated by both climate and interspecific competition.Synthesis and applications. Managers have a fundamental objective directed by official policy of maintaining the species 'for the foreseeable future'. Our evaluation of multiple hypotheses about population drivers reveals that extinction is projected for this species. Our analysis suggests that considering active management need not depend on resolving the uncertainty.

Most of forms are inherited as dominant trait, and with incomplete penetrance until adulthood. Severe forms of cardiomyopathies were observed during the antenatal period with a pejorative issue leading to fetal death or medical interruption of pregnancy. Variable phenotypes and genetic heterogeneity make etiologic diagnosis difficult. We report 11 families (16 cases) whose unborn, newborn or infant with early onset cardiomyopathies. Detailed morphological and histological examinations of hearts were implemented, as well as genetic analysis on a cardiac targeted NGS panel. This strategy allowed the identification of the genetic cause of the cardiomyopathy in 8/11 families. Compound heterozygous mutations in dominant adulthood cardiomyopathy genes were found in two, pathogenic variants in co-dominant genes in one, de novo mutations in 5 including a germline mosaicism in one family. Parental testing was systematically performed to detect mutation carriers, and to manage cardiological surveillance and propose a genetic counseling. This study highlights the great diagnostic value of the genetic testing of severe antenatal cardiomyopathy both for genetic counseling and to detect presymptomatic parents at higher risk of developing cardiomyopathy.

Genetic analysis and outcomes of Omani children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome	MOLECULAR GENETICS & GENOMIC MEDICINE			English	Article						edema; hyperlipidemia; hypoalbuminemia; kidney failure; proteinuria; steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome	KIDNEY-DISEASE; NPHS1 MUTATIONS; COHORT; SPECTRUM; VARIANT; VIEW	BackgroundNephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most common kidney disorders seen by pediatric nephrologists and is defined by the presence of heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h), hypoalbuminemia (<3.5 g/dL), edema, and hyperlipidemia. Most children with NS are steroid-responsive and have a good prognosis following treatment with prednisolone. However, 10%-20% of them have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and fail to respond to treatment. A significant proportion of these children progress to kidney failure. MethodsThis retrospective study aimed to determine the underlying genetic causes of SRNS among Omani children below 13 years old, over a 15-year period and included 77 children from 50 different families. We used targeted Sanger sequencing combined with next-generation sequencing approaches to perform molecular diagnostics. ResultsWe found a high rate of underlying genetic causes of SRNS in 61 (79.2%) children with pathogenic variants in the associated genes. Most of these genetically solved SRNS patients were born to consanguineous parents and variants were in the homozygous state. Pathogenic variants in NPHS2 were the most common cause of SRNS in our study seen in 37 (48.05%) cases. Pathogenic variants in NPHS1 were also seen in 16 cases, especially in infants with congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS). Other genetic causes identified included pathogenic variants in LAMB2, PLCE1, MYO1E, and NUP93. ConclusionNPHS2 and NPHS1 genetic variants were the most common inherited causes of SRNS in Omani children. However, patients with variants in several other SRNS causative genes were also identified. We recommend screening for all genes responsible for SRNS in all children who present with this phenotype, which will assist in clinical management decisions and genetic counseling for the affected families.

This study investigates the longitudinal and differential effect of chief executive officer (CEO) tenure on external and internal CSR and the moderating effects of two important contingencies relevant to the firm's social investments: firm visibility and slack availability. It presents CEO tenure as an important upper echelon factor that may induce differential preferences toward external and internal CSR and, therefore, CSR inconsistencies. Accordingly, it proposes two important and relevant contingencies and provides additional evidence on how a firm's visibility and slack availability could affect CEO tenure-related differential behaviors. The findings contribute to studies on the temporal orientations of CEOs and how they impact firm strategic behavior. They also contribute to the literature on firm visibility and slack and how they may interact with certain upper echelon characteristics and affect firm behaviors. The analysis cautions against the perceptions of the relationships between firm- and CEO-level variables and a firm's aggregate CSR.

The circular economy (CE) is considered a long-term initiative for protecting the environment by reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions, recycling and ending planned obsolescence. This research aims to explore antecedents for the CE capability in the context of the Indian MSMEs. The current study used the extended theory of planned behaviour and institutional theory to measure CE capabilities. Seven hypotheses are developed in this study. The survey-based research is carried out with 296 responses from the MSMEs of different sectors in India. Hypothesis testing is done using the structural equation modelling approach. Major constructs identified for this study are green economic incentives (GEIs), social pressure (SP) and attitude. These constructs have a significant association with the CE capability of MSMEs. Environmental commitment (EC) and sustainable supply chain design (SSCD) act as mediators. Insights from this study will help the top management of MSMEs to understand antecedents for CE capability. The findings show that SP and GEIs are positively associated with EC and SSCD. It is found that EC and SSCD play a complimentary mediation role. The research findings will provide a solid foundation for understanding the importance of CE capability in MSMEs and developing strategic plans to facilitate implementing CE in these small sized firms.

A pinning delayed-impulsive control scheme is proposed to solve the synchronization of MASs under deception attacks that modify the transmitted data information and destroy the data integrity. The time delay can have a gain effect on the stability of the system by using time delay utilization technology. By selecting the appropriate time delay parameters, the convergence speed of the system is effectively improved. Furthermore, cooperative and competitive interactions between agents are considered. Sufficient conditions of the bipartite mean-square bounded synchronization of MASs under deception attacks are theoretically obtained. Finally, the designed numerical simulations illustrate the correctness and effectiveness of our results.

J	Dinamarca-Aravena, KA				Dinamarca-Aravena, Katherine Andrea			The professional role and exercise of the role of educational assistance professionals in schools with School Integration Programs in Chile	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS			English	Article; Early Access						educational psychologist; occupational therapist; physical therapist; professional role; special educational needs; speech therapist	INCLUSIVE EDUCATION; TEACHERS; EXPERIENCES; THERAPISTS; ATTITUDES	The incorporation of health professionals into inclusive schools is increasingly necessary. However, the work of these professionals has not yet been studied globally. This qualitative research analyses the perceptions of speech therapists, psychologists, physical therapists and occupational therapists on the role that educational policy defines for working in schools with School Integration Programmes in Chile. Through chain sampling, 52 professionals were interviewed. The data were analysed inductively through thematic analysis. The results show that the role defined by policies for professionals is not in line with the needs of schools and the aspirations of the inclusive approach. The exercise of the role emerges as a distinct entity from the defined role that seems to be more responsive to the needs of schools and students. Interviewees described tensions related to the role in schools, professional training, working conditions and contextual features that would permeate the role that the policy mandates them to play. The findings of the study promote new research horizons related to the role of professional assistants, where research is still incipient worldwide, and invite reflection on the importance of designing education policies with a bottom-up approach to capture the needs presented by learners and professional teams.

Alkyl PAHs are more abundant than nonalkylated PAHs in certain environmental matrices and there is growing evidence that alkylation can increase potency, dependent on the position of alkylation. However, it is unknown if the effect of alkylation on potency is conserved across species. In addition, relatively little is known regarding the extent of interspecies variation in sensitivity to PAHs and alkyl PAHs. Therefore, objectives of the present study were to characterize potency of benz[a]anthracene (BAA) and three alkylated homologues representing different alkylation positions in nine phylogenetically diverse species of fish using a standardized in vitro AhR2 transactivation assay. BAA and each alkylated homologue activated the AhR2 in a concentration-dependent manner in each species. Position-dependent effects on potency were observed in every species, but these effects were not consistent across species. Interspecies variation in sensitivity to AhR2 activation by each PAH was observed and ranged by up to 561-fold. Alkylation both increased and decreased the range of interspecies variation and sensitivity, but the potency of each alkylated homologue relative to BAA ranged by less than an order of magnitude among species. These results represent an early step toward the consideration of alkylated homologues for more objective ecological risk assessments of PAHs to native fishes. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;00:1-11.

An analysis of the optical properties of several HMCy is presented, emphasizing the similarities and differences between IR780 and HITC (used as a case study of HMCy), mainly by analyzing meso-substitution and investigating the effect of intermediate structures between both molecules. The two-photon absorption cross-section of HITC diluted in methanol was measured, yielding a peak of 1838 GM at 830 nm. Spectroscopic and electronic structure computational data show that the change of polymethine chain substituents significantly affects excited state S-4 of the molecules, modulating their transition moment and relative energy which, together with changes in the molecular geometry, govern non-linear absorption.

However, the oxygen in the flue gas will oxidize Co(II)TETA to Co(III) TETA, resulting in the reduction of denitrification efficiency. Activated carbon has been used to promote the regeneration of Co(II)TETA due to its unique surface characteristics. Hydrogen peroxide solution is utilized as a modifier in the carbon modification to improve the catalytic performance of activated carbon. The experiments demonstrate that the best regeneration efficiency of Co(II)TETA is gained by the modified carbon impregnated in 0.05 mol L-1 H2O2 solution at 70 degrees C for 12 h with a solid/liquid ratio of 1/50 (g/mL) followed being activated at 400 degrees C for 2 h in N-2. After being treated with hydrogen oxide solution, the surface area and acidity of the carbon is increased. Continuous experiments reveal that the NO removal efficiency gained by modified activated carbon is about 8.36% higher than that gained by the original carbon.

However, identifying atomic structure of HEA with complex atomic arrangement is challenging, which seriously hinders the fundamental understanding of catalytic mechanism. Here, we report a HEA-PdNiRuIrRh catalyst with remarkable mass activity of 3.25 mA mu g(-1) for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is 8-fold enhancement compared to that of commercial Pt/C. Through machine learning potential-based Monte Carlo simulation, we reveal that the dominant Pd-Pd-Ni/Pd-Pd-Pd bonding environments and Ni/Ru oxophilic sites on HEA surface are beneficial to the optimized adsorption/desorption of *H and enhanced *OH adsorption, contributing to the excellent HOR activity and stability. This work provides significant insights into atomic structure and catalytic mechanism for HEA and offers novel prospects for developing advanced HOR electrocatalysts.

Assessing the potential of <i>Pycnoderes quadrimaculatus</i> Guerin-Meneville (Heteroptera: Miridae) as a pest through Ecological Niche Models	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						plant bug; bean capsid; niche shift; invasive species; climate change	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; HEMIPTERA HETEROPTERA; ANNOTATED LIST; SYNOPSIS; TRIBES; AREAS	BACKGROUNDPycnoderes quadrimaculatus is a pest that feeds on several plants, many of which are economically important. It is native to North/Central America and its distribution has expanded to several countries in South America. RESULTSEcological niche models show that P. quadrimaculatus has invaded regions with climates different from those of its native range, and that there are suitable climatic conditions for its establishment worldwide. Regions where P. quadrimaculatus is a major threat and possible natural pathways of ingression were identified. In the future, its distribution will be modified by climate change. CONCLUSIONSThis study provides useful information for risk assessment and pest management of P. quadrimaculatus. According to our results, the species has great potential as a pest because it can adapt to different climatic conditions and feeds on a wide range of economically important plants. Over time, its distribution has expanded, and our models suggest that it will continue to invade other regions unless preventive measures are taken. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Integration of interictal EEG source localization in presurgical epilepsy evaluation - A single-center prospective study	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						drug-resistant focal epilepsy; electric source imaging; epilepsy surgery	ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; CLINICAL UTILITY; DISCHARGES	ObjectiveTo investigate cost in working hours for initial integration of interictal EEG source localization (ESL) into clinical practice of a tertiary epilepsy center, and to examine concordance of results obtained with three different ESL pipelines. MethodsThis prospective study covered the first year of using ESL in the Epilepsy-Center Berlin-Brandenburg. Patients aged >= 14 years with drug-resistant focal epilepsy referred for noninvasive presurgical evaluation were included. Interictal ESL was based on low-density EEG and individual head models. Source maxima were obtained from two freely available software packages and one commercial provider. One physician and computer scientist documented their working hours for setting up and processing ESL. Additionally, a survey was conducted among epilepsy centers in Germany to assess the current role of ESL in presurgical evaluation. ResultsOf 40 patients included, 22 (55%) had enough interictal spikes for ESL. The physician's working times decreased from median 4.7 hours [interquartile range 3.9-6.4] in the first third of cases to 2.0 hours [1.9-2.4] in the remaining two thirds; P < 0.01. In addition, computer scientist and physician spent a total of 35.5 and 33.0 working hours on setting up the digital infrastructure, and on training and testing. Sublobar agreement between all three pipelines was 20%, mean measurement of agreement (kappa) 0.13. Finally, the survey revealed that 53% of epilepsy centers in Germany currently use ESL for presurgical evaluation. SignificanceThis study provides information regarding expected effort and costs for integration of ESL into an epilepsy surgery program. Low result agreement across different ESL pipelines calls for further standardization.

The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)(3), and B(C6F5)(3) efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12 kcal mol(-1) compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO-lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli-lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)(3) furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)(3) yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.	[Tiekink, Eveline H.

In current study, we investigated the pathological characteristics and immune response in gut-liver axis of white crucian carp (WCC) upon gut infection. WCC anally intubated with A. hydrophila exerted a tissue deformation in damaged midgut with elevated levels of goblet cells along with a significant decrease in tight junction proteins and villi length-to-width ratios. In addition, immune-related gene expressions and antioxidant properties increased dramatically in gut-liver axis of WCC following gut infection with A. hydrophila. These results highlighted the immune modulation and redox alteration in gut-liver axis of WCC in response to gut infection.

However, two major complications, including residual tumor cells and large bone defects, often arise from the surgical resection of osteosarcoma. Discovering new strategies for programmatically solving the two above-mentioned puzzles has become a worldwide challenge. Herein, a novel one-step strategy is reported for natural phenolic acid planted nanohybrids with desired physicochemical properties and steerable photothermal effects for efficacious osteosarcoma suppression and bone healing. Nanohybrids are prepared based on the self-assembly of chlorogenic acid and gold nanorods through robust Au-catechol interface actions, featuring precise nanostructures, great water solubility, good stability, and adjustable hyperthermia generating capacity. As expected, on the one hand, these integrated nanohybrids can severely trigger apoptosis and suppress tumor growth with strong hyperthermia. On the other hand, with controllable mild NIR irradiation, the nanohybrids promote the expression of heat shock proteins and induce prominent osteogenic differentiation. This work initiates a brand-new strategy for assisting osteosarcoma surgical excision to resolve the blockage of residual tumor cells elimination and bone regeneration.

Especially, the diverse crystal structures and exceptional physical properties of multielement van der Waals semiconductors have provided a brand-new platform for the implementation of novel optoelectronic devices. In this study, for the first time, the optoelectronic properties of a newly emerged quaternary van der Waals semiconductor, namely silver indium phosphorus sulfide (AgInP2S6), have been systematically investigated. It is revealed that the AgInP2S6 photodetector exhibits a fast response rate with the response/recovery time down to approximate to 1/2 ms. In addition, the AgInP2S6 device demonstrates stable photoswitching operation even under a high working temperature of up to 160 degrees C in the ambient environment without using any specific protection means, and the photoswitching characteristic is also well reserved after a 10-h continuous heating at 150 degrees C in air. Profiting from the strong immunity to environmental thermal disturbance, a proof-of-concept high-temperature optical communication application is demonstrated. In conclusion, this study provides an intriguing paradigm for the realization of the next-generation optoelectronic devices against extreme working circumstances, which contributes to further broadening the scope of application of 2D material photodetectors in the upcoming future (e.g., space communication and tracking).

Benefits of using nonionic saccharide surfactant-based detergents for nanostructured fluids as stubborn graffiti paint remover	JOURNAL OF SURFACTANTS AND DETERGENTS			English	Article; Early Access						graffiti remover; nanostructured detergent; saccharide-based surfactant; surface properties	SOLVENT PROPERTIES; CONTACT	Examples of nanostructured fluids (NSFs) used as highly specialized "brush-on, wipe-off" detergents for the removal of graffiti coatings resistant to removal are water-in-oil nanoemulsions that have been stabilized with nonionic saccharide surfactants. Nanodetergents with safe, ecofriendly ingredients were produced using high-pressure homogenization (HPH). These ingredients included D-limonene or 3-methoxy-3-methyl-1-butanol, esterified vegetable oils, and alkyl polyglucosides (APG). Responsive surface methodology (RSM) optimization was used to identify the most efficient detergents for removing stubborn graffiti coatings. Two different types of black paint containing nitrocellulose or bitumen as components to strengthen the paint properties were used to create a stubborn graffiti coating on a marble surface. The effectiveness of the nanodetergents in removing the stubborn graffiti coatings was evaluated, and the results revealed a considerable variation in the pace at which the coatings could be removed by the nanodetergents, despite the fact that both paints strengthened with different additives showed similar surface properties. It was found that alkyl polyglucosides are highly efficient in stabilizing water-in-oil nanoemulsion systems, including diverse solvent types. These nanoemulsions can be used as specialized "brush-on, wipe-off" detergents for the precise removal of different graffiti coatings, which require a specified action period to prevent destroying the underlying original substrate.

The effects of environmental change since the Miocene have accelerated species diversification, and hence are useful for studying population genetic structure, and evolutionary relationships via genetic approaches. To date, the effects of climatic fluctuations on the biogeography of large-bodied lizards have not been assessed comprehensively. Herein, we examine the diversification of Varanus bengalensis, focusing on its genetic structure to provide insights into how landscape structure and climatic fluctuations have shaped species differentiation. We confirm the existence of two distinct lineages within V. bengalensis distributed across the Himalayan foothills and the remainder of mainland India. Divergence analyses revealed the split between the Himalayan foothills and the remainder of the mainland lineages of V. bengalensis in the midPliocene similar to 3.06 Ma, potentially as a consequence of the Siwalik broadening and climatic fluctuations across the Himalayan foothills. The results suggest recognition of a new lineage of V. bengalensis from the Himalayan foothills as a distinctive evolutionarily significant unit.

Concluding reflections	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES			English	Article; Early Access							PEER	This article contains concluding reflections for a special issue on sexual harassment among young people. In this concluding article, we reflect on the 14 individual papers in the special issue through three cross-cutting themes, each with important implications for policy and practice. The themes highlight that (1) attitudes and norms related to sexual harassment are core to its occurrence among young people, (2) the sexual harassment experiences of minority and otherwise hidden youth need to be heard, and (3) innovative approaches and methods advance the current knowledge about sexual harassment among young people. Furthermore, we stress that school policies against sexual harassment need to be reflected in the behaviors of school personnel and peers, and that both students and teachers need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to combat sexual harassment. It is our hope that this special issue will be valuable for researchers, the formulation of societal and school policies, and for the design of developmentally informed interventions.

MethodsPubMed and Scopus were searched for studies published up to April 2022. The primary outcome of this study was the difference in biomarker concentrations in saliva or serum samples from healthy control (HC), OL and oral cancer (OC) populations. Cohen's d with 95% credible interval was calculated and pooled using the inverse variance heterogeneity method. ResultsA total of seven saliva biomarkers were analyzed in this paper, including interleukin-1alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-6-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), copper, zinc, and lactate dehydrogenase. IL-6 and TNF-alpha exhibited statistically significant deviations in comparisons between HC versus OL and OL versus OC. A total of 13 serum biomarkers were analyzed, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins, albumin, protein, beta 2-microglobulin, fucose, lipid-bound sialic acid (LSA), and total sialic acid (TSA). LSA and TSA exhibited statistically significant deviations in comparisons between HC versus OL and OL versus OC. ConclusionIL-6 and TNF-alpha in saliva have strong predictive values for OL deterioration, and LSA and TSA concentration levels in serum also have the potential to serve as biomarkers for OL deterioration.

In the simulations, the MRT was varied and the inherent properties of the MHT were controlled using experimental methods. With an increase in MRT, the velocity in all directions, pressure drop, and shear rate of the melt increased; however, increasing the MRT does not always yield a positive effect on the GAE process of the melt. For instance, the melt velocity increased vertically at the die exit with MRT, resulting in an out-ward extrudate swell. In addition, the extruded product was intact when the melt was heated to 220 degrees C, which verified the principle of time-temperature equivalence.

Building displacement can be formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem, and a heuristic or intelligent search algorithm can be borrowed to obtain the solution. In this way, we can explicitly resolve minimum distance conflicts and control positional accuracy during the displacement. However, maintaining spatial relations and patterns of buildings can be challenging. To address spatial conflicts as well as preserve the significant spatial relations and patterns of buildings, we propose a new spatial contextual displacement algorithm based on an immune genetic algorithm. To preserve important spatial relations and global patterns of map objects and avoid topology errors, displacement safety zones are constructed by overlapping the Voronoi tessellation and buffer areas of the buildings. Additionally, a strategy to shift the buildings in a building group synchronously is used to maintain local building patterns. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, two data sets with different building densities were tested. The results indicate that the new algorithm has obvious advantages in preventing topology errors and preserving spatial relations and patterns.

And social capital is the foundation of corporate survival and enhancing value is the goal of corporate survival. The interaction between social responsibility, social capital and corporate value and the degree of influence is an issue waiting to be studied. This paper takes listed companies from 2010 to 2020 as the research object, and empirically examines the dynamic interrelationship and degree of influence between the three on time series by constructing the PVAR model to include the three in the same analytical framework. The study shows that: (1) There is a virtuous circle mechanism of "social responsibility-social capital-corporate value". (2) CSR and social responsibility are mutually causal, and social responsibility and corporate value are mutually causal, while social capital can only enhance corporate value in one direction. (3) Although the interaction between the three variables gradually decreases and tends to zero over time, it still has a strong lag, and the effect generated in the current period can lag at least 10 periods. The research results enrich the dynamic relationship between social capital, social responsibility and corporate value, and provide strategic references for corporate value enhancement.

We draw on our personal experiences and recall how the use of OR in forestry has evolved from the early use of linear programming in the Canadian forest products industry in the 1950s and strategic forest management planning by the U.S. Forest Service in the 1960s. We describe the widespread use of OR in many aspects of forestry over a 50-year timespan (1970-2020) and to the present day, where climate change and biodiversity challenges and increased data availability are important. The paper covers many areas of forestry, including forest management, natural disturbance processes, tactical and operational harvesting, transportation, and value chain management. Each section in the paper includes a historical description of OR-based key applications as well as OR-based model and method developments Additionally, we discuss our perceptions of OR in future use and its importance in forestry.

There is a need for sustainable finance to support this. Savings and credit cooperatives could help to achieve this impact as they serve the microfinance and microlending market. They facilitate the financial inclusion of the most vulnerable people, most of whom live in rural areas and are members of organizations, such as agricultural cooperatives and associations. Previous studies have focused exclusively on overall profitability, so this paper contributes to extending the literature by analyzing the whole population of savings and credit cooperatives in Ecuador (510 institutions), focusing on their profitability in two ways: the overall profitability necessary for the viability of the business and, in addition, the microcredit portfolio profitability, as a specific measure of its contribution to sustainability and social value creation. Another novelty is that the analysis has been carried out using several machine learning techniques for the wider generalization of the results. These show that size is the most relevant variable for predicting the ROE and that the microcredit portfolio profitability is conditioned by the credit variables.

When predictions are accurate, this increases the efficiency of comprehension. However, little is known about the fate of predictable and unpredictable words in memory or the neural systems governing these processes. Several theories suggest that the speech production system, including the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC), is recruited for prediction but evidence that LIFC plays a causal role is lacking. We first examined the effects of predictability on memory and then tested the role of posterior LIFC using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In Experiment 1, participants read category cues, followed by a predictable, unpredictable, or incongruent target word for later recall. We observed a predictability benefit to memory, with predictable words remembered better than unpredictable words. In Experiment 2, participants performed the same task with electroencephalography (EEG) while undergoing event-related TMS over posterior LIFC using a protocol known to disrupt speech production, or over the right hemisphere homologue as an active control site. Under control stimulation, predictable words were better recalled than unpredictable words, replicating Experiment 1. This predictability benefit to memory was eliminated under LIFC stimulation. Moreover, while an a priori ROI-based analysis did not yield evidence for a reduction in the N400 predictability effect, mass-univariate analyses did suggest that the N400 predictability effect was reduced in spatial and temporal extent under LIFC stimulation. Collectively, these results provide causal evidence that the LIFC is recruited for prediction during silent reading, consistent with prediction-through-production accounts.

The high image quality depends on X-ray detectors with excellent properties. To meet the future demand for high-performance scintillation screens, adding a new luminescent center in Cs3Cu2I5 by doping is considered. The successful incorporation of Mn brought a new luminescence peak at 565 nm. Different excitation modalities such as ultraviolet and X-rays have the ability to tune luminescence. X-ray can promote the energy transfer efficiency of self-trapped excitons and non-radiative intermediate trap states to doping Mn2+ ions. This results in a higher radioluminescence intensity of a radioluminescence light yield of 65 000 Photons MeV-1. Subsequently, a Cs3Cu2I5: Mn scintillation screen is prepared by anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) template. The array channel structure of the AAO template strongly suppresses the internal scintillation light scattering, allowing more scintillation photons to be emitted efficiently. Under the combined effect of Mn-enhanced radioluminescence properties and AAO template suppressed light scattering, it obtains the lowest detection limit of 49 nGy(air) s(-1). High X-ray imaging quality has been achieved for circuit boards, beetles, and ball-point pens and reached a high X-ray imaging resolution of 11.8 lp mm(-1).

J	Ying, ZJ				Ying, Zu-Jian			Nodes and Spin Windings for Topological Transitions in Light-Matter Interactions	ADVANCED QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						anisotropic quantum Rabi model; level anti-crossing; light-matter interaction; nodes and spin windings; spin knots; topological classification	PHASE-TRANSITION; QUANTUM; MODELS; GAS	The anisotropic quantum Rabi model (QRM) is the fundamental model of light-matter interactions with indispensable counter-rotating terms in ultra-strong couplings. By extracting different levels of topological information a new light is shed on the energy spectrum of the anisotropic QRM. Besides conventional topological transitions (TTs) at gap closing, abundant unconventional TTs are unveiled underlying level anticrossings without gap closing by tracking the wave-function nodes, including a particular unconventional TT which turns out to be universal for different energy levels. On the other hand, it is found that the nodes have a correspondence to spin windings, which not only endows the nodes a more explicit topological character in supporting single-qubit TTs but also turns the topological information physically detectable. Furthermore, hidden small-spin-knot transitions are exposed for the ground state, while more kinds of spin-knot transitions emerge in excited states including unmatched node numbers and spin winding numbers. Based on node sorting, algebraic formulation is established to decode the topological information encoded geometrically in the wave functions and spin windings.

In uremic cardiomyopathy, interstitial fibrosis was the major histological alteration. The prognostic value of VRLN in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains unclear. Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic value of VRLN MRI in patients with ESRD. Study Type: Prospective. Population: A total of 127 ESRD patients (30 participants in the major adverse cardiac events, MACE group). Field Strength/Sequence: 3.0 T/steady-state free precession sequence, modified Look-Locker imaging. Assessment: MRI image qualities were assessed by three independent radiologists. VRLN values were measured in the myocardium on the mid-ventricular short-axis slice of T1 mapping. Left ventricular (LV) mass, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, as well as LV global strain cardiac parameters were measured. Statistical Tests: The primary endpoint was the incident of MACE from enrollment time to January 2023. MACE is a composite endpoint consisting of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and life-threatening arrhythmia. Cox proportional-hazards regression was performed to test whether VRLN independently correlated with MACE. The intraclass correlation coefficients of VRLN were calculated to evaluate intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. The C-index was computed to examine the prognostic value of VRLN. P-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Participants were followed for a median of 26 months. VRLN, age, LV end-systolic volume index, and global longitudinal strain remained significantly associated with MACE in the multivariable model. Adding VRLN to a baseline model containing clinical and conventional cardiac MRI parameters significantly improved the accuracy of the predictive model (C-index of the baseline model: 0.781 vs. the model added VRLN: 0.814). Data Conclusion: VRLN is a novel marker for risk stratification toward MACE in patients with ESRD, superior to native T1 mapping and LV ejection fraction.

The dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and strain properties are all found to be electric field-dependent, especially for BTS-0.15BCT ceramic with small domains and easy polarization rotation induced by phase coexistence. High ferroelectric and strain properties are obtained in this ceramic because sufficient domain switching can easily be achieved. The high dielectric constant can be further elevated after poling this ceramic due to the E-induced multiphase transitions. Dynamic piezoelectric measurement reveals that the dynamic piezoelectricity can reach to similar to 740 pC/N, which is much higher than the static value (similar to 620 pC/N) of poled BTS-0.15BCT ceramic. However, the converse piezoelectric coefficient will decrease at high E, because of the quick decrease in dynamic dielectric response caused by clamped polarization at high E. All the results demonstrate that phase-coexistence BT-based ceramic shows electric field-related properties due to the soft structure, whereas it cannot be observed in BT ceramic with stable phase structure and large domains. This work reveals the evolution difference and structure origin of electrical properties in BT-based piezoceramics with different phase structures.

The inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition (IEDDA) reaction has offered the greatest prospect of achieving such a feat and has gained much interest over the past decade. The fast reaction kinetics of the IEDDA reaction opens up the possibility of utilising a pretargeted approach, whereby the subject is pretreated with a biomolecule that has high specificity for its target. A radiolabelled second component is then administered to the subject, enabling the biomolecule to be visualised by PET. However, for this to become common practice, there is a need for the development of either radiolabelled trans-cyclooctenes (TCOs) or tetrazines that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This review highlights the advancements in the development of both radiolabelled TCOs and tetrazines, which have been radiolabelled with either carbon-11 or fluorine-18 and show promise or have been evaluated for use in pretargeted PET imaging across the BBB.

Security and efficiency are the two main issues in cloud service. Numerous intrusion detection techniques for the cloud computing environment were proposed, but those techniques do not effectively and accurately detect the attacks. Hence, an efficient and secure key management using extended convolutional neural network, that is, hybrid Enhanced Elman Spike convolutional Neural Network optimized with improved COOT optimization algorithm (Hyb EESCCNN) is proposed for intrusion detection in cloud system. Furthermore, the novel Adaptive Tangent Brakerski-Gentry Vaikuntanathan Homomorphic Encryption (ATBGVHE) method is proposed for providing the security of the system. At first, SHA-512 is used for authenticating cloud users to store its own information in to the cloud server. Then for Intrusion Detection (ID) the input data from the NSL-KDD, UNSWNB15, CICIDS2018, and ToN-IoT datasets are pre-processed. The most relevant features are extracted using Fast Independent Component Analysis (Fast ICA) from the pre-processed output. These extracted data are classified into malicious and non-malicious data using Hyb EESCCNN. After classification, the non-malicious data is secured using an ATBGVHE technique. The outcomes of the proposed methods shows that the NSL-KDD datasets attains 99.9% higher accuracy, UNSW-NB15 datasets offer 99.89% higher accuracy, CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets attains 99.8% higher accuracy, ToN-IoT datasets attains 99.8% higher accuracy and 0.02 s lower encryption time compared with existing methods. Finally, case study with real time applications is also analyzed to prove the efficiency of the proposed method.

Climate change over Indonesia and its impact on nutmeg production: An analysis under high-resolution CORDEX-CORE regional simulation framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; nutmeg; production; rainfall; temperature	RISK-ASSESSMENT; COTTON CROP; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; STRATEGIES; SCENARIO; INDEXES; YIELDS; INDIA	Nutmeg is an important spice and contributes significantly to the gross domestic product of Indonesia. The study examines the impact of climate change on Indonesia and the production of nutmeg over Banda Neira Island. For this, the outputs from high-resolution regional climate models under different representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), within the framework of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5/Coordinated Regional Climate Down-scaling Experiment-Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CMIP5/CORDEX-CORE) over southeast Asia domain are employed. The representation of the spatial structure of rainfall and temperature climatology is found to be much better in ensembles as compared to individual model experiments. The behaviour of simulated rainfall and temperature from the model experiments is examined to check whether the projected climate favours an increase in nutmeg production. The study found that projected changes in the number of wet days (ideal 100-160 wet days), heavy rainfall events, rising mean temperature above the optimum temperature range (25-26 degrees C), increasing heatwave spells, and prolongation of the warm period led to an unfavourable climate for nutmeg production. Based on the analysis of dynamically produced (model simulated) climate variables, the study rejects the forecasted increase in nutmeg production using a statistical regression model due to the unfavourable climatic conditions that are likely to affect the growth, production and quality of nutmeg. The changing climate not only reduces regional agricultural production but also impacts the socio-economic condition of the people of Indonesia. Therefore, the study emphasizes implementing stringent climate laws and policies at global, regional and local levels to curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the negative impact of climate change.

J	Fu, X; Wang, Y; Zhou, Y; Xia, B				Fu, Xian; Wang, Yu; Zhou, Yan; Xia, Bing			Automated high-throughput characterization of microbial metabolites and species using array ballpoint electrospray ionization technique	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article; Early Access							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; BIOSYNTHESIS; BACTERIA	RationaleMicrobial metabolites are widely used in agriculture, food, environment, and medicine. However, there is a lack of high-throughput, nonclogging, and simple methods for the identification of microbial metabolites and their subspecies using ambient mass spectrometry (MS). Here, we proposed a method for analyzing the microbial metabolites and identifying their species using the array ballpoint electrospray ionization (aBPESI) technique. MethodsThe previously developed BPESI was combined with the array analysis technique to form a high-throughput analysis technique called aBPESI. The bacteria cultured on the plate medium were directly analyzed using MS with aBPESI. Principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) algorithm was used to analyze the different subspecies groups. ResultsThe results showed that aBPESI was capable of completing a sample analysis within 30 s, and the level of metabolite detection was comparable to existing techniques. The accuracy of bacterial subspecies identification was 90% (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 100% (Serratia marcescens). ConclusionsA new high-throughput and robust MS technique aBPESI was proposed. It does not require sample pretreatment and greatly reduces the sample analysis time. aBPESI shows a strong ability in microbial analysis and is expected to be further applied in other research fields.

Synthesis of microcrystalline cellulose from abaca nonfluorescent flower pistil and its twill weaved fiber-polyester composites: Viscoelastic, fatigue, and mechanical properties	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article						cellulose; composites; dynamic mechanical analysis; fatigue behavior; fiber		The development of microcrystalline cellulose from banana flower pistil and its twill weaved woven abaca polyester composites were studied in this research. The aim of this research was to explore the viscoelastic, fatigue, and mechanical behavior of surface-treated twill weaved abaca fiber and unsaturated polyester incorporating banana flower pistil cellulose particles for various composite combinations. Hand layup process was used to construct the bio-composite laminates, which were then tested in accordance with american society for testing and materials (ASTM) standards. The maximum tensile strength and modulus, flexural strength and modulus, Izod impact strength, as well asinter laminar shear strength (ILSS) values by addition of 3.0 vol% of cellulose were about 124 MPa, 4.48 GPa, 163 MPa, 5.36 GPa, 5.33 J/m(2), and 27 MPa respectively, whereas composite having 5.0 vol% of cellulose gave better hardness of 82 shore-D. Incorporation of cellulose by 3.0 vol% with 50 vol% of abaca fiber increases fatigue life counts up to 35,480, 29,039, 24,802, and 18,247 for 25%, 50%, 70%, and 90% of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) respectively. On comparing all other composite combinations, the composite containing 3.0 vol% of cellulose shows the highest storage modulus of up to 5.6 GPa and the lowest loss factor of 0.38. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fractography shows the improved adhesion between fiber and matrix due to the silane treatment on cellulose and abaca fiber. These novel functional materials could be employed in a large range of applications, including industrial, automobile, electronic and household equipment.

The photocatalyst (Pt@bpyCTF) with structural defects reduces CO2 to formic acid (FA) at a rate of 152 mu mol h(-1)g(-1) and a selectivity higher than 95% over CO and H-2 in water under simulated solar light. The presence of amine defects and the immobilization of Pt cause improvement in the photocurrent density and CO2 capture capacity (approximate to 8% by weight) despite the moderate surface area (0.54 cm(3) g(-1))of the photocatalyst. Theoretical models and density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate the possible CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) mechanisms. Considering the exceptional CO2 capture capacity and high FA production using only CO2-bubbled water, this work highlights the great potential of nitrogen-rich CTFs for photocatalyzed CO(2)RRs under green conditions.

The Great Contrast Shortage of 2022-Lessons learnt in Australia	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY			English	Article						body CT; chest imaging; contrast; head and neck imaging	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIATION; MEDIA; RISK; CT	IntroductionComputed tomography (CT) imaging is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools. Iodine-based contrast media (IBCM) are frequently administered intravenously to improve soft tissue contrast in a wide range of CT scans. Supply chain disruptions triggered by the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic led to a global shortage of IBCM in mid-2022. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of this shortage on the delivery of healthcare in Western Australia. MethodsWe performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of the provision of CT studies, comparing historical patterns to the shortage period. We focussed our attention on the total number of CT scans (noncontrast CT [NCCT] and contrast-enhanced CT [CECT]) and also specifically CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and CT neck angiogram with or without inclusion of circle of Willis (CTNA) examinations. We also examined whether a decrease was compensated by increasing frequency of alternate examinations such as ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans, carotid Doppler ultrasound studies and Magnetic Resonance Angiograms (MRAs). ResultsSince 2012, there has been an approximate linear increase in the frequency of CT examinations. During the period of contrast shortage, there was an abrupt drop-off by approximately 50% in the CECT, CTPA and CTNA groups compared with the preceding 6 weeks (49%, 55% and 44%, respectively, with P < 0.001 in all cases). During the contrast shortage, the frequency of V/Q scans increased fivefold (from 13 to 65; P < 0.001). However, the provision of carotid Doppler ultrasound studies and MRAs remained approximately stable in frequency across recent time intervals. ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that the IBCM shortage crisis had a very significant impact on the delivery of healthcare. While V/Q scans could (partially) substitute for CTPA studies in suspected pulmonary emboli, there appeared to be no valid alternative for CTNA studies in stroke calls. The unexpected and critical shortage of IBCM forced healthcare professionals to conserve resources, prioritise indications, triage patients based on risk, explore alternate imaging strategies and prepare for similar events recurring in the future.

To avoid intraspecific competition and increase offspring survival, insects have evolved various effective strategies. A widely-accepted tactic is employing chemical cues, which are frequently utilized as indicators of conspecific colonization. The sweet potato weevil (SPW), Cylas formicarius, is a destructive pest of sweet potatoes. Its larvae bore into sweet potatoes and alter the emission of odors. The present study aimed to investigate whether volatiles associated with SPW larvae feeding influence the behavioral preference of conspecific adults. RESULTSVolatiles from SPW larvae-infested sweet potatoes were collected by a head-space method and analyzed using gas chromatography-electroantennogram detector (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Five compounds eliciting EAD responses from the antennae of both male and female adult SPW were identified from sweet potatoes with the third-instar larvae, including linalool, citronellol, nerol, geraniol, and ipomeamarone. Four monoterpene alcohols significantly repelled SPW adults from feeding and oviposition at higher doses in the behavioral preference bioassays. Among them, geraniol displayed the strongest repellent activities for SPW feeding and oviposition. These results suggested that SPW larvae could reduce colonization of adult SPWs by inducing monoterpene alcohols, thereby avoiding intraspecific competition. CONCLUSIONThe present study demonstrated that volatile monoterpene alcohols induced by SPW larvae are chemical cues of larvae occupation for SPW adults to change their behavioral preference. Unveiling factors that mediate avoidance of intraspecific competition could help develop repellents or oviposition deterrents for SPW control. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Aiming to inhibit liquid permeation, two kinds of superhydrophobic coatings are applied to the SR surface. The liquid permeation properties of SR with different types of liquids are investigated, and the Langmuir diffusion model is applied to analyse the experimental data. The results show that the composite superhydrophobic coating can effectively inhibit liquid permeation by reducing the contact area between the surface and liquid, and the stable structure of the composite coating can maintain the performance after the liquid permeation and effusion. However, the nano-particle coating without the polymer binder experiences severe performance degradation during the immersion test, and it cannot restrain the liquid permeation anymore after it loses the superhydrophobicity. As a validation of the effective protection, the insulation resistivity change was measured. The resistivity decreases sharply for the pristine SR after water permeation; however, the decrease is much smaller for the coated SR. The current study not only provides new insight into the liquid permeation properties of SR with different surface wettability but also suggests an effective measure to prevent liquid permeation into SR.

The process of lithification could be an important factor in changing the properties of artificial ground and ameliorating these challenges. In this study, a lithified deposit of a furnace slag associated with a former iron and steel works in Scotland was analysed to determine the mechanisms and drivers of lithification. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed that Ca leached from around the edges of clasts of slag through reaction of the chemically unstable slag with water from an adjacent water body. Dissolution of Ca (and OH-) from the slag caused the water in contact with the slag to become hyperalkaline, facilitating ingassing and hydroxylation of CO2 from the atmosphere (fingerprinted through carbon isotope analysis). Reaction of the dissolved Ca and CO2 led to precipitation of calcite. Scanning electron microscope analysis showed the calcite is distributed between slag clasts, forming rims around clasts and cementing clasts together into a solid rock-like mass. Understanding the mechanisms and drivers of lithification in artificial ground will be important, given its widespread nature particularly in urban areas where artificial ground is the substrate of most development.

It has mainly been observed in children and adults with a history of developmental delay and epilepsy, frequently with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), but the nature and significance of these inclusions are unclear. In this study, we review the clinical and pathologic features of HPA and characterize the inclusions and brain tissue in which they are seen in surgical resection specimens from five patients with intractable epilepsy and HPA compared to five patients with intractable epilepsy without HPA using immunohistochemistry for filamin A, previously shown to label these inclusions, and a variety of astrocytic markers including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1), SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9 (SOX9), and glutamate transporter 1/excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (GLT-1/EAAT2) proteins. The inclusions were positive for ALDH1L1 with increased ALDH1L1 expression in areas of gliosis. SOX9 was also positive in the inclusions, although to a lesser intensity than the astrocyte nuclei. Filamin A labeled the inclusions but also labeled reactive astrocytes in a subset of patients. The immunoreactivity of the inclusions for various astrocytic markers and filamin A as well as the positivity of filamin A in reactive astrocytes raise the possibility that these astrocytic inclusions may be the result of an uncommon reactive or degenerative phenomenon.

We examine how evolving individual- and community-level Covid-19 risk mechanisms and socioeconomic and life-course conditions are associated with continuity and change in women's fertility intentions. We combine individual-level panel data from a population-based sample of women aged 18-34 in Pernambuco, Brazil in 2020 and 2021 with corresponding administrative data from 94 municipalities. We use multinomial logit regressions to model continuity and change in fertility intentions across waves. We then estimate fixed effect models to highlight the time-varying determinants of changing fertility intentions while accounting for unobserved, time-invariant individual factors. We find that high and/or increasing individual and community-level Covid-19 exposure is associated with a greater likelihood of abandoning initial childbearing plans and a greater likelihood to maintain intentions to forego versus to intend having additional children. We advance the literature by highlighting how individual-level Covid-19 infection risk perceptions matter for fertility intentions, net of community-level exposure, and the necessity of dynamic perspectives for understanding how fertility intentions have changed (or not) in response to the pandemic.

However, the data of high-grade nonoriented silicon steel are limited, and the rolling process parameters differ, resulting in poor crown prediction. Herein, a model based on the whale optimization algorithm and transfer learning to predict the crowns of hot-rolled high-grade nonoriented silicon strip steel is presented. The model is composed of convolutional and linear layers. The whale optimization algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters and obtain an optimal model during pretraining. The model is then fine tuned based on insufficient silicon steel data to achieve model migration. The application results show that the correlation coefficient reaches 0.993, which is the highest prediction accuracy among the comparison models. Furthermore, the root mean square error is 1.14 mu m, and the hit rate within 4.0 mu m of the crown deviation reaches 99.502%. In addition, the influences of four parameters on the crown of the silicon steel strip are studied based on the response surfaces. The results indicate that the proposed model can efficiently predict silicon steel strip crowns.

Voltage recovery (VR) has shown notable improvements for perfluorosulfonic acid-based fuel cells. This study is the first to present a VR protocol designed specifically for hydrocarbon-based fuel cells. The proposed protocol involves 100 voltage steps at 0.08 and 0.12 V, lasting 20 s each, at 80 degrees C, under backpressure and oversaturated conditions. The effectiveness of the protocol is compared to other protocols, including one proposed by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and another VR from the literature. The VR protocol results in a 100% increase in the mass activity of the fully hydrocarbon-based fuel cells after only 1 h, while the DOE protocol leads to no improvement, and another established protocol requires 3 h to show a 70% increase. The proposed protocol is also effective for Nafion catalyst layers. The H-2/air performance at 0.7 V of the fully hydrocarbon-based fuel cells increases by 21%, resulting in a current density of 0.9 A cm(-2), similar to the Nafion reference. This suggests that the proposed protocol is highly effective and significantly reduces the conditioning time, which can be a significant cost factor.

ER is attracting global interest and restoration opportunities will increase in upcoming decades, but it requires restorers, the participation of relevant stakeholders, and a better adaptation to societal needs. Service-learning (S-L), an educational methodology based on community projects, represents a way to extend the range of action of ER and to involve society, especially younger generations. We describe S-L for the learning/training of students in environmental issues presenting initiatives that, using S-L to develop collaborative projects, have been carrying out activities related to fire prevention or post-fire restoration. S-L projects provide a context for the training of future professionals and generate a working-collaborative environment favoring the active participation of society in environmental actions. Indirectly, S-L projects can increase knowledge transfer and inculcate the necessity for protection and conservation, improving the capacity, involvement, and commitment of society to ER.

The shear texture contains Goss texture {110}, brass texture {110}, and copper texture {112}. The existence of shear texture and its corresponding microstructure affect the texture distribution in the subsequent normalized sheets, cold-rolled sheets, and final sheets. Electron backscattered diffraction and reaction stress model are used herein to study the formation conditions of {112} orientation in the hot-rolled sheets. The results show that initial rotated cube orientation tends to rotate around transverse direction to the copper orientation during hot rolling due to the shear action. Different shear orientations can be formed in different regions of an initial coarse columnar grain during hot rolling, because of the change in surrounding environment reaction and the difference of the shear strain at different thickness positions. The thinner the hot-rolled sheet is, the smaller the dynamic recrystallization region with shear orientation, and there is almost no copper texture in the thinnest hot-rolled sheet. The simulation results show that the copper texture is easy to form under the action of sigma(23) and sigma(22) reaction stresses.

We find that better employee treatment improves the amount of informal finance a firm can obtain. This effect is stronger in environments with (1) more intensive product market competition, (2) highly customized inputs, (3) lower social capital and (4) high demand for skilled labor. Furthermore, the role of employee treatment varies according to a firm's financial health and liquidity. Employee treatment becomes less important for firms having a low level of liquidity but is more pronounced for firms experiencing financial distress.

Yet current extrusion-based 3D printing strategies are unable to recapitulate hierarchical networks, highlighting the need for bioinks with tunable properties. Here, we introduce an approach whereby crosslinkable microgels enhance mechanical stability and induce spontaneous microvascular networks comprised of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a soft gelatin methacryoyl (GelMA)-based bioink. Furthermore, we successfully implanted the 3D printed multi-branched tissue, being connected from the rat carotid artery to the jugular vein direct surgical anastomosis. The work represents a significant step toward in the field of large vascularized tissue fabrication and may have implications for the treatment of organ failure in the future.

Human extended pluripotent stem cells (hEPSCs), recently established by two independent studies, have the capability of differentiating into both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages, as well as forming human blastoids, showing great potential for early human development modeling and regenerative medicine. Considering that X chromosome status in female human pluripotent stem cells is dynamic and heterogeneous, and often leads to functional consequences, we characterized it in hEPSCs. We derived hEPSCs from primed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with defined X chromosome status (pre- or post-X chromosome inactivation) using two previously published methods. We showed that hEPSCs derived using both methods had highly similar transcription profiles and X chromosome status. However, the X chromosome status of hEPSCs is largely determined by the primed hESCs from which they were derived, suggesting a lack of complete reprogramming of X chromosome during primed to extended/expanded pluripotency conversion. Furthermore, we found that the X chromosome status of hEPSCs affected their ability to differentiate into embryonic or extraembryonic lineage cells. Taken together, our work characterized the X chromosome status of hEPSCs, providing important information for the future application of hEPSCs.

Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one-photon and two-photon excitation.

Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an additional treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus patients with persistent disease activity and lupus nephritis (LN); however, severe active central nervous system manifestations were excluded. Case ReportWe report on a treatment-naive LN patient with refractory NPSLE complicated with progressive posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) who was successfully treated via the combination of mycophenolate and belimumab, resulting in reversal of persistent headache and neuroradiologic manifestations. ConclusionResearch on this topic could be relevant for identifying a possible correlation between BAFF and psychiatric NPSLE manifestations.

Methods that could efficiently incorporate the difluoromethyl group into the target molecules are increasing in the recent years. Developing a stable and efficient difluoromethylating reagent is thus highly attractive. In this review, we describe the development of a nucleophilic difluoromethylation reagent [(SIPr)Ag(CF2H)], including its elemental reaction, difluoromethylation reaction with different types of electrophiles, and its application in the synthesis of a nucleophilic and an electrophilic difluoromethylthiolating reagent.

A digital depth gauge was used to measure the liquid level on the spiral troughs. The tracer particle trajectories and the free surface velocity of a spiral were determined with a high-speed camera. An increase in the flow rate leads to an increase in the liquid depth and free surface velocity along the trough surface. Three full turns of the high gravity spiral concentrator are sufficient for achieving a stabilized flow. High-gravity spirals show lower flow depths and free surface velocities but steeper depths on the outer trough zone than low-gravity spirals. Higher flow depths contribute to larger circulation zones, which eventually help in greater separation of heavier minerals from gangue particles.

The SiO2 shell covers the surface of the NCs, providing long-term working and excellent thermal cycling stability. Ba2+ dopes the lattice of the perovskite structure under high-temperature sintering at 700 degrees C, resulting in the red-shift of the NCs emission due to the decrease of the bandgap caused by the lattice modulation with Ba2+. At the same time, the halogen vacancies are effectively passivated by a halogen-rich environment of dopants (BaBr2). The Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage of the doped ceramic-like NCs is (0.170, 0.760), which approaches the Rec.2020 standard. By means of this solid reaction process, red, green, and blue ceramic-like perovskite NCs are prepared to achieve white light-emitting diodes, covering 124% of the National Television Standards Committee.

The newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antiproliferative activity toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines. The most active compounds on both cell lines were additionally evaluated for their in vitro CDK2 inhibitory activity. Compounds 7b and 12f displayed enhanced activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 0.46 and 0.27 mu M, respectively) in comparison to the standard roscovitine (IC50 = 1.41 +/- 0.03 mu M), in addition to, cell cycle arrest at S phase and G1/S transition phase in MCF7 cells treated with both compounds, respectively. Moreover, the most active spiro-oxindole derivative against MCF7 cell line, 16a, exhibited enhanced inhibitory activity against p53-MDM2 interaction in vitro (IC50 = 3.09 +/- 0.12 mu M) compared to nutlin, and increased the levels of both p53 and p21 by nearly fourfold in comparison to the negative control. Molecular docking studies demonstrated the plausible interaction patterns of the most potent derivatives 17b and 12f in the CDK2 binding pocket and the spiro-oxindole 16a with p53-MDM2 complex, respectively. Consequently, the new chemotypes 7b, 12f, and 16a can be presented as promising antitumor hits for further studies and optimization.

Application of PDT as a conventional treatment is limited and clearly the approval in clinics of new PS is challenging. The selective accumulation of the PS in the targeted malignant cells is of paramount importance to reduce the side effects that are typical of the current worldwide approved PS. Here we report a new series of aniline- and iodine-substituted BODIPY derivatives (1-3) as promising lysosome-targeting and pH-responsive theranostic PS, which displayed a significant in vitro light-induced cytotoxicity, efficient imaging properties and low dark toxicity (for 2 and 3). These compounds were obtained in few reproducible synthetic steps and good yields. Spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements along with computational calculations confirmed the quenching of the emissive properties of the PS, while both fluorescence and O-1(2) emission were obtained only under acidic conditions inducing amine protonation. The pK(a) values and pH-dependent emissive properties of 1-3 being established, their cellular uptake and activation in the lysosomal vesicles (pH approximate to 4-5) were confirmed by their co-localization with the commercial LysoTracker deep red and light-induced cytotoxicity (IC50 between 0.16 and 0.06 mu M) against HeLa cancer cells.

Here, a 3D host made of lithiophilic Mo2C clusters-embedded carbon nanofibers (Mo2C@CNF) is developed. The uniformly dispersed clusters and large specific surface areas of Mo2C@CNF provide numerous nucleation sites for lithium deposition. Mo2C clusters exhibit ultralow nucleation overpotential compared to MoO2, which is also supported by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the transition metal element serves as a catalyst for the formation of a stable and robust solid electrolyte interphase layer containing LiF on Mo2C@CNF, effectively mitigating the occurrence of dead lithium and enhancing the Coulombic efficiency during prolonged operation. As a result, the Mo2C@CNF composite delivers superior electrochemical performance (>1600 h) at 1 mA cm(-2) and lower nucleation overpotential (13 mV) for lithium plating. The Li/Mo2C@CNF anode coupled with the commercial LiFePO4 cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability (300 cycles at 1 C) and high rate capability at low N/P ratios.

However, developing efficient and environmentally friendly de-icing methods still fails because of compatibility problems with large-scale devices and real-world conditions. In this paper, de-icing several square centimeters covered with thick layers of glaze ice is approached through nanoscale activation by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). De-icing functionality is demonstrated with a self-supported piezoelectric material (LiNbO3) and a piezoelectric film (ZnO) deposited on fused silica, the latter system proving the compatibility of the method with materials of practical relevance. Its applicability to large and transparent substrates is demonstrated by placing the interdigitated electrodes (IDTs) required for activation close to the substrate's edges, leaving most of the surface unaltered. The de-icing mechanism of glaze ice by SAW activation is revealed by simulating the SAW propagation on ice-covered surfaces and by experimental analysis of the ice melting process. This involves a combination of ice mechanical stress activation and heating through the initially formed water/ice front. Possible Joule effects due to ohmic losses in the IDTs have been discarded, monitoring local temperature variations during SAW activation at and out of resonance conditions.

A novel approach for enlarged FOV scanning with one full-scan (EnFOV360) or two short-scans (EnFOV180) using an O-arm system arises from non-isocentric imaging based on independent source and detector rotations. PurposeThe presentation, description, and experimental validation of this novel approach and the novel scanning techniques EnFOV360 and EnFOV180 for an O-arm system forms the scope of this work. MethodsWe describe the EnFOV360, EnFOV180, and non-isocentric imaging techniques for the acquisition of laterally extended FOVs. For their experimental validation, scans of dedicated quality assurance as well as anthropomorphic phantoms were acquired, with the phantoms being placed both within the tomographic plane and at the longitudinal FOV border with and without lateral shifts from the gantry center. Based on this, geometric accuracy, contrast-noise-ratio (CNR) of different materials, spatial resolution, noise characteristics, as well as CT number profiles were quantitatively assessed. Results were compared to scans performed with the conventional imaging geometry. ResultsWith EnFOV360 and EnFOV180, we increased the in-plane size of acquired FOVs from 250 x 250 mm(2) obtained for the conventional imaging geometry to up to 400 x 400 mm(2) for the performed measurements. Geometric accuracy was very high for all scanning techniques with mean values <= 0.21 +/- 0.11 mm. CNR and spatial resolution were comparable between isocentric and non-isocentric full-scans as well as EnFOV360, whereas substantial image quality deteriorations in this respect were observed for EnFOV180. Image noise in the isocenter was lowest for conventional full-scans with 13.4 +/- 0.2 HU. For laterally shifted phantom positions, noise increased for conventional scans and EnFOV360, whereas noise reductions were observed for EnFOV180. Considering the anthropomorphic phantom scans, both EnFOV360 and EnFOV180 were comparable to conventional full-scans. ConclusionBoth enlarged FOV techniques have high potential for imaging laterally extended FOVs. EnFOV360 revealed an image quality comparable to conventional full-scans in general. EnFOV180 showed an inferior performance particularly regarding CNR and spatial resolution.

Microbubbles caused by cavitation in the LVAD can potentially lead to physiological and pump-related complications. The aim of this study is to characterize the vibrational patterns in the LVAD during cavitation. MethodsThe LVAD was integrated into an in vitro circuit and mounted with a high-frequency accelerometer. Accelerometry signals were acquired with different relative pump inlet pressures ranging from baseline (+20 mmHg) to -600 mmHg in order to induce cavitation. Microbubbles were monitored with dedicated sensors at the pump inlet and outlet to quantify the degree of cavitation. Acceleration signals were analyzed in the frequency domain to identify changes in the frequency patterns when cavitation occurred. ResultsSignificant cavitation occurred at the low inlet pressure (-600 mmHg) and was detected in the frequency range between 1800 and 9000 Hz. Minor degrees of cavitation at higher inlet pressures (-300 to -500 mmHg) were detected in the frequency range between 500-700, 1600-1700 Hz, and around 12 000 Hz. The signal power of the dominating frequency ranges was statistically significantly different from baseline signals. ConclusionVibrational measurements in the LVAD can be used to detect cavitation. A significant degree of cavitation could be detected in a wide frequency range, while minor cavitation activity could only be detected in more narrow frequency ranges. Continuous vibrational LVAD monitoring can potentially be used to detect cavitation and minimize the damaging effect associated with cavitation.

Simple machine learning methods work surprisingly well for Ramanomics	JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						machine learning; Raman spectroscopy		Recently, a deep convolutional neural network was employed to detect liver cancer by Ramanomics. Results on a demo dataset claimed an accuracy of about 90% to be achieved after around an hour of training in a modern desktop. However, my experience with another Ramanomics dataset taught me that simple methods could potentially outperform deep learning. Here, I tested the simple and interpretable method of logistic regression. It achieved an accuracy of around 90.4% in under a minute. Employing a random decision forest yields an accuracy of 92.6% in under 10 s. Thus, although deep learning is promising, it is yet to provide a quantum-leap in performance for Ramanomics.

Progressive Cardiac Metabolic Defects Accompany Diastolic and Severe Systolic Dysfunction in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat Hearts	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; diastolic and systolic function; dynamic FDG PET; left ventricular hypertrophy; myocardial metabolism; spontaneously hypertensive rats	LEFT-VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY; PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION; FATTY-ACID-METABOLISM; FAILURE; MODEL; TRANSITION	BackgroundCardiac metabolic abnormalities are present in heart failure. Few studies have followed metabolic changes accompanying diastolic and systolic heart failure in the same model. We examined metabolic changes during the development of diastolic and severe systolic dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods and ResultsWe serially measured myocardial glucose uptake rates with dynamic 2-[F-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography in vivo in 9-, 12-, and 18-month-old SHR and Wistar Kyoto rats. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging determined systolic function (ejection fraction) and diastolic function (isovolumetric relaxation time) and left ventricular mass in the same rats. Cardiac metabolomics was performed at 12 and 18 months in separate rats. At 12 months, SHR hearts, compared with Wistar Kyoto hearts, demonstrated increased isovolumetric relaxation time and slightly reduced ejection fraction indicating diastolic and mild systolic dysfunction, respectively, and higher (versus 9-month-old SHR decreasing) 2-[F-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake rates (Ki). At 18 months, only few SHR hearts maintained similar abnormalities as 12-month-old SHR, while most exhibited severe systolic dysfunction, worsening diastolic function, and markedly reduced 2-[F-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake rates. Left ventricular mass normalized to body weight was elevated in SHR, more pronounced with severe systolic dysfunction. Cardiac metabolite changes differed between SHR hearts at 12 and 18 months, indicating progressive defects in fatty acid, glucose, branched chain amino acid, and ketone body metabolism. ConclusionsDiastolic and severe systolic dysfunction in SHR are associated with decreasing cardiac glucose uptake, and progressive abnormalities in metabolite profiles. Whether and which metabolic changes trigger progressive heart failure needs to be established.	[Li, Jie; Minczuk, Krzysztof; Huang, Qiao; Chordia, Mahendra D.; Roy, R.

Experience of missed nursing care: A mixed method study	WORLDVIEWS ON EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING			English	Article						adult health; adult care; communication; nursing practice; patient safety; quality improvement; quality of care; quality of services; work environment; working conditions		BackgroundMissed nursing care is a global phenomenon affecting patient safety and quality of care. The working environment of nurses seems to play an important role in missed nursing care. AimsThis study was conceptualized to explore the link of environmental constraints with missed nursing care in the Indian context. MethodA convergent mixed-method design was adopted, and data was collected using Kalisch's MISSCARE survey from 205 randomly selected nurses involved in direct patient care in the acute care settings of four tertiary care hospitals in India. In the qualitative phase, in-depth interviews regarding nurses' experience of missed care were performed with 12 nurses chosen by maximum variant sampling from the quantitative sample. ResultsThe integrated results revealed that nurses experience a sense of competing priority in the environment where curative and prescribed tasks like medication administration get more priority than activities like communication, discharge teaching, oral hygiene, and emotional support, which are frequently missed. The human resource and communication constraints together explained 40.6% of variance in missed nursing care. Human resource inadequacy in times of increased workload was the most frequently cited reason for missed care. Converging with this finding, nurses in the interviews expressed that maintaining a flexible number of staff and catering to the variable workload can effectively reduce missed nursing care. Frequent interruption of nursing activities by medical staff and lack of structure in some activities were cited as important reasons for missed care. Linking Evidence to ActionNursing leaders need to acknowledge missed care in nursing and develop policies to maintain flexible staffing based on situational workload. Methods of staffing like NHPPD (Nursing hour per patient day) which are more sensitive to nursing workload, and patient turnover, can be adopted instead of a fixed nurse-patient mandate. Mutual support from team members and multi-professional cooperation can reduce frequent interruption of nursing tasks thereby reducing missed care.

However, most studies in this area are case-control studies without in vitro data showing the involvement of IgE in the reaction. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the reactivity to a 50-55 kDa protein with clinical signs immediately after contact with grass leaf material. The clinical findings of dogs with atopic-like dermatitis immediately after contact with grass leaf material suggest the involvement of grass leaves as the allergen source.Objectives: This study was designed to test the IgE-reactivity of grass leaf proteins in dogs with clinical signs and positive scratch test results against grass leaf material.Materials and Methods: The serum of 41 patients with a history of allergy and suspected to grass leaf material was immunoblotted against grass leaf extracts from five suspected grass species. The IgE-positive blots were separated with 2D gel electrophoresis and analysed with mass spectrometry (MS). Commercially supplied proteins were used to validate immunoblot activity.Results: The serum of 25 dogs diagnosed with grass dermatitis had positive IgE-specific immunoblot against one or more grass leaf extracts. The MS data indicated a reactive band at 55 kDa to be beta-amylase or RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) large subunit (RbLS). All tested dog sera showed IgE-reactivity with beta-amylase and some with RbLS.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Canines with clinical signs of grass-related dermatitis had IgE-reactivity against grass leaf proteins. Serum IgE-reactivity to beta-amylase and RuBisCO large subunit may indicate that these proteins act as allergens, possibly causing pruritus and skin lesions.

The N-heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2-regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p-substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L- for steric reasons despite both giving three-coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn-H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.

This study aimed at determining the prevalence of LPA risk variants in adult individuals with FH enrolled in the Italian LIPIGEN (Lipid Transport Disorders Italian Genetic Network) study, with (FH/M+) or without (FH/M-) a causative genetic variant. Methods and ResultsAn lp(a) [lipoprotein(a)] genetic score was calculated by summing the number risk-increasing alleles inherited at rs3798220 and rs10455872 variants. Overall, in the 4.6% of 1695 patients with clinically diagnosed FH, the phenotype was not explained by a monogenic or polygenic cause but by genotype associated with high lp(a) levels. Among 765 subjects with FH/M- and 930 subjects with FH/M+, 133 (17.4%) and 95 (10.2%) were characterized by 1 copy of either rs10455872 or rs3798220 or 2 copies of either rs10455872 or rs3798220 (lp(a) score >= 1). Subjects with FH/M- also had lower mean levels of pretreatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than individuals with FH/M+ (t test for difference in means between FH/M- and FH/M+ groups <0.0001); however, subjects with FH/M- and lp(a) score >= 1 had higher mean (SD) pretreatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (223.47 [50.40] mg/dL) compared with subjects with FH/M- and lp(a) score=0 (219.38 [54.54] mg/dL for), although not statistically significant. The adjustment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels based on lp(a) concentration reduced from 68% to 42% the proportion of subjects with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level >= 190 mg/dL (or from 68% to 50%, considering a more conservative formula). ConclusionsOur study supports the importance of measuring lp(a) to perform the diagnosis of FH appropriately and to exclude that the observed phenotype is driven by elevated levels of lp(a) before performing the genetic test for FH.

The use of agent based simulators encourages good software engineering design such as separation of concerns, that is, the uncoupling of the model description from its implementation detail. A major limitation in current approaches to ABM simulation is that of the trade off between simulator flexibility and performance. It is common that highly optimised simulations, such as those which target graphics processing units (GPU) hardware, are implemented as standalone software. This work presents a software framework (FLAME GPU 2) which balances flexibility with performance for general purpose ABM. Methods for ensuring high computational efficacy are demonstrated by, minimising data movement, and ensuring high device utilisation by exploiting opportunities for concurrent code execution within a model and through the use of ensembles of simulations. A novel hierarchical sub-modelling approach is also presented which can be used to model certain types of recursive behaviours. This feature is shown to be essential in providing a mechanism to resolve competition for resources between agents within a parallel environment which would otherwise introduce race conditions. To understand the performance characteristics of the software, a benchmark model with millions of agents is used to explore the use of simulation ensembles and to parametrically investigate concurrent code execution within a model. Performance speedups are demonstrated of 3.5x and 10x respectively over a baseline GPU implementation. Our hierarchical sub-modelling approach is used to demonstrate the implementation of a recursive algorithm to resolve competition of agent movement which occurs as a result of agent desire to simultaneously occupy discrete areas high in a `resource'. The algorithm is used to implement a classical socio-economics model, Sugarscape, with populations of up to 16M agents.

Over the last decades, event-related potentials (ERPs) have been used to unravel this question, but the findings are mixed. To address this controversy, two meta-analyses were conducted to quantify the results of existing studies reporting N2 or medial frontal negativity (MFN) associated with deception. In total, 32 papers consisting of 1091 participants were included, which yielded 32 effect sizes for N2 and 7 effect sizes for MFN. We found that deception was associated with a more negative N2 and MFN than truth-telling with medium and large effect sizes (r = .25 and .51, respectively). We also found that the deception paradigm modulated the results (p = .043), but found no evidence for publication bias. Our findings indicate that deception involves more cognitive control than truth-telling. Our review also identifies gaps in this literature, including a need for more ERP studies using spontaneous deception.

Floods can greatly raise the cost of mitigation efforts due to their damaging consequences. The natural water balance is disrupted by an increase in impermeable areas. As runoff rises, so do flood peaks and volumes even in short, low-intensity showers. Urban flooding is a significant impact of urbanization that has drawn the attention of experts. Currently, there are techniques based on distributed hydrologic modeling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) used to assess the influence of land use for urbanization on the environment. Deep learning techniques with their immense performance in Computer Vision and Image Processing fields have been extended to the problem of urban floods by integrating them with a GIS-based methodology. This study outlines multiple techniques that have been used to address urban floods.

To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular p-p interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish p-p interaction with 1-naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p-type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01 %. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94 % after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000 h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed-dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.

J	Zhang, TT; Yang, HY; Ge, WY; Lin, Y				Zhang, Tingting; Yang, Hongyu; Ge, Wenyi; Lin, Yi			An image-based facial acupoint detection approach using high-resolution network and attention fusion	IET BIOMETRICS			English	Article						biometric applications; face biometrics		With the prevalence of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), automation techniques are highly required to support the therapy and save human resources. As the fundamental of the TCM treatment, acupoint detection is attracting research attention in both academic and industrial domains, while current approaches suffer from poor accuracy even with sparse acupoints or require extra equipment. In this study, considering the decision-making knowledge of human experts, an image-based deep learning approach is proposed to detect facial acupoints by localising the centre of acupoints. In the proposed approach, high-resolution networks are selected as the backbone to learn informative facial features with different resolution paths. To fuse the learnt features from the high-resolution network, a resolution, channel, and spatial attention-based fusion module is innovatively proposed to imitate human decision, that is, focusing on the facial features to detect required acupoints. Finally, the heatmap is designed to integrally achieve the acupoint classification and position localisation in a single step. A small-scale real-world dataset is constructed and annotated to evaluate the proposed approach based on the authorised face dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms other baseline models, achieving a 2.4228% normalised mean error. Most importantly, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technical improvements are also confirmed by extensive experiments. The authors believe that the proposed approach can achieve acupoint detection with considerable high performance, and further support TCM automation.

Both obesity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are associated with heart rate variability (HRV) (a hall marker of sympathetic arousal) and increased risk of CVD. This study aims to investigate whether anthropometric parameters could predict reduced HRV in adult OSA during wakefulness. Study DesignCross-sectional study. SettingSleep center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth Hospital from 2012 to 2017. MethodsTotal of 2134 subjects (503 non-OSA and 1631 OSA) were included. Anthropometric parameters were recorded. HRV was recorded during a 5-minute wakefulness period and analyzed by using time-domain method and frequency-domain method. Multiple step-wise linear regressions were performed to determine significant predictors of HRV with and without adjustments. Multiplicative interactions between gender, OSA, and obesity on HRV were also determined and evaluated. ResultsWaist circumference (WC) was significant negative determinant of root mean square of successive NN intervals (beta = -.116, p < .001) and high-frequency power (beta = -.155, p < .001). Age was the strongest determining factor of HRV. Significant multiplicative interactions between obesity and OSA on HRV, gender, and obesity on cardiovascular parameters were observed. ConclusionAnthropometric parameters could predict reduced HRV during wakefulness in patients with OSA, especially WC was the strongest influenceable factor. Obesity and OSA had significant multiplicative interaction on HRV. Gender and obesity had significant multiplicative interaction on cardiovascular parameters. Early intervention for obesity, especially centripetal obesity, may improve reduction of autonomic function and risk of CVD.

J	Hu, SL; Zhu, SY				Hu, Shuling; Zhu, Songye			Life-cycle benefits estimation for hybrid seismic-resistant self-centering braced frames	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						BRBF; hybrid self-centering braced frames; initial construction cost; life-cycle cost; self-centering; shape memory alloy	COST ASSESSMENT; STEEL FRAME; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; CONNECTIONS; BEHAVIOR; RISK; OPTIMIZATION; BUILDINGS; DEMANDS	The hybrid self-centering braced frames (HSBFs) with shape memory alloy-based braces (SMABs) and viscous dampers (VDs) are an emerging structural system developed for improving the seismic resilience of traditional braced frames (e.g., buckling restrained braced frames [BRBFs]) and self-centering braced frames (SCBFs) by reducing residual inter-story drifts (RIDs) and floor acceleration responses simultaneously. Nevertheless, the excellent performance of HSBFs is captured by introducing high initial construction costs. This paper aims to highlight the benefits of HSBFs compared with BRBFs and SCBFs by investigating the earthquake-induced life-cycle costs. To this end, 6-story BRBF, SCBF, and HSBF are designed separately to achieve the same maximum inter-story drifts under design basis earthquakes (DBE) for a fair comparison. The advanced numerical models of the considered systems were developed, and nonlinear dynamic analyses were conducted to obtain the structural seismic responses under various intensities. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was adopted for considering the modeling uncertainty. The life-cycle costs were subsequently estimated based on the revised HAZUS loss estimation method. The influence of RIDs, initial construction costs of SMABs and VDs, and values of contents inside buildings were comprehensively investigated. It has been found that HSBF can achieve better performance in reducing seismic loss than BRBF and SCBF due to its excellent capability of controlling structural and nonstructural damage. SCBF may show higher seismic loss than BRBFs, given high RID limits for demolition or high building contents' value, highlighting the importance of controlling floor acceleration responses of SCBFs. The life-cycle benefits of BRBFs, SCBFs, and HSBFs are highly influenced by the RIDs, initial construction costs of SMABs and VDs, building contents' values, and building's lifetime. HSBFs show better life-cycle benefits than SCBFs when the building's lifetime is not lower than 50 years. Compared to BRBF, the life-cycle cost effectiveness of SCBF can be only achieved when the initial cost of SMABs is lower than 1.21 times that of BRBs for the building with 50 years' lifetime; the life-cycle cost effectiveness of HSBF6 can be only achieved when the initial cost of SMABs or VDs is lower than 1.84 times that of BRBs for the building with 50 years' lifetime. It has been concluded that reducing the initial costs of SMABs and VDs is critical and essential for increasing the life-cycle economic benefits of SCBFs and HSBFs and promoting their real-world applications.

Epidemiological studies have revealed a close association between IBD and HPBC. MethodsHerein, we utilized inverse-variance weighting to conduct a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis. We sought to investigate the link between various subtypes of IBD and HPBC. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of our findings, we conducted heterogeneity tests, gene pleiotropy tests, and sensitivity analyses. ResultsCompared to the general population, IBD patients in Europe exhibited a 1.22-fold increased incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.0022-1.4888 (p = 0.0475). We also found a 1.14-fold increased incidence of PC in Crohn's disease (CD) patients with (95% CI: 1.0017-1.3073, p = 0.0472). In the East Asian population, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 1.28-fold higher (95% CI = 1.0709-1.5244, p = 0.0065) in IBD patients than in the general population. Additionally, ulcerative colitis (UC) patients displayed 1.12-fold (95% CI: 1.1466-1.3334, p < 0.0001) and 1.31-fold (95% CI: 1.0983-1.5641, p = 0.0027) increased incidences of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), respectively. Finally, the incidence of PC was 1.19-fold higher in CD patients than in the general population (95% CI = 1.0741-1.3132, p = 0.0008). ConclusionOur study validated that IBD is a risk factor for HPBC. This causal relationship exhibited significant heterogeneity in different European and East Asian populations.

It emphasizes the importance of comprehensive doping control analytical procedures that are capable of detecting SARM misuse. MethodsIn this study, it is described how LY2452473, a SARM, was metabolized in thoroughbred horses after a single-dose oral administration and in vitro with equine liver microsome preparations. An investigation of the metabolism of LY2452473 in horses' urine, plasma, and hair matrices was carried out during the study. The plausible structures of the detected metabolites were postulated using high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. ResultsUnder the experimental conditions 15 metabolites (12 phase I and three conjugates of phase I) were detected (M1-M15). The major phase I metabolites identified were formed by hydroxylation. Side-chain dissociated and methylated metabolites were also detected. In phase II, the glucuronic acid and sulfonic acid conjugates of hydroxy LY2452473 were detected as the major metabolites. In vitro analysis has confirmed the presence of all metabolites found in vivo except for the methylated analogs M11 and M12. A peak concentration of LY2452473 (0.5 pg/mg) in proximal hair segments was achieved 4 weeks after administration, according to hair analysis. ConclusionsData obtained will aid in identifying LY2452473 and related substances faster. Furthermore, the results will assist in checking for the illegal use of these substances in competitive sports.

Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon-based connectors from a non-oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H-2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed-anion solids	[Kumar, Ram; Song, Yang; Ghoridi, Anissa; Gervais, Christel; Sassoye, Capucine; Laberty-Robert, Christel; Portehault, David] Sorbonne Univ, Coll France, CNRS, Lab Chim Matiere Condensee Paris CMCP, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Boullay, Philippe] Normandie Univ, ENSICAEN, UNICAEN, CNRS,CRISMAT, F-14000 Caen, France; [Rousse, Gwenaelle] Sorbonne Univ, PSL Res Univ, Coll France, Chimie Solide & Energie, 11 Pl Marcelin Berthelot, F-75007 Paris, France; [Diogo, Cristina Coelho] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Materiaux Paris, Ctr IMPC, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Kabbour, Houria] Univ Artois, Univ Lille, UCCS Unite Catalyse & Chim Solide, CNRS,ENSCL,UMR 8181, F-59000 Lille, France; [Beaunier, Patricia] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Lab React Surface LRS, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France; [Castaing, Victor; Viana, Bruno] PSL Res Univ, Inst Rech Chim Paris, Chim ParisTech, CNRS, 11 Rue Pierre & Marie Curie, F-75005 Paris, France; [Gonzalez, Maria Luisa Ruiz; Calbet, Jose Gonzalez] Univ Complutense, Fac Quim, Dept Quim Inorgan, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Gonzalez, Maria Luisa Ruiz; Calbet, Jose Gonzalez] Univ Complutense, Ctr Nacl Microscopia Elect, Madrid 28040, Spain	UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; College de France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Sorbonne Universite; Universite de Caen Normandie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; College de France; Sorbonne Universite; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lille - ISITE; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); Universite d'Artois; UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Chimie ParisTech; Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid	Portehault, D (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, Coll France, CNRS, Lab Chim Matiere Condensee Paris CMCP, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France.	david.portehault@sorbonne-universite.fr	Portehault, David/S-4148-2019; MEZQUITA, MARIA LUZ GONZÁLEZ/GNP-0102-2022; Rousse, Gwenaelle/N-7748-2013	Portehault, David/0000-0003-4914-4913; MEZQUITA, MARIA LUZ GONZÁLEZ/0000-0002-6013-7434; GHORIDI, Anissa/0000-0002-6546-8742; Rousse, Gwenaelle/0000-0001-8877-0015; Kabbour, Houria/0000-0002-9081-3261; Sassoye, Capucine/0000-0003-2790-888X; Gervais, Christel/0000-0001-7450-1738; Kumar, Ram/0000-0001-8044-5306	CNRS; College de France; European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant GENESIS; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [FR CNRS 3507]; IRMA platform (CRISMAT-Caen) of the CNRS-CEA METSA network [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory [097535]; French Region Ile de France-SESAME program;  [PID 2020-113753RB-100];  [864850]	CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); College de France; European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant GENESIS(European Research Council (ERC)); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); IRMA platform (CRISMAT-Caen) of the CNRS-CEA METSA network; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science User Facility operated for the DOE Office of Science by Argonne National Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); French Region Ile de France-SESAME program(Region Ile-de-France); ; 	The authors acknowledge the CNRS and College de France for funding.

HLA-DRB115 and Eosinophilia Are Common Among Patients With Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis	ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH			English	Article								ObjectiveConcern exists that medications used to treat patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), particularly interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 blocking agents, might be causing adverse drug reactions and lung disease (systemic JIA-LD). Carriage of HLA-DRB1*15 has been reported as a risk factor for adverse drug reactions among patients with systemic JIA. We performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate these factors at our center. MethodsWe reviewed the records of 86 subjects with systemic JIA followed for at least 6 months between 1996 and 2022. HLA typing was performed in 23 of the subjects. We compared characteristics of patients with or without eosinophilia. Among patients with HLA typing, we compared clinical characteristics of subjects with or without DRB1*15 and with or without systemic JIA-LD. ResultsAmong the 23 patients with HLA typing, 74% carried DRB1*15, and 63% of patients without systemic JIA-LD carried DRB1*15. Seven subjects had systemic JIA-LD, all of whom carried DRB1*15. Patients with systemic JIA-LD were younger at the time of diagnosis and more likely to have had macrophage activation syndrome. Exposure to IL-1 and IL-6 blockers was common, occurring in 95% of patients. Eosinophilia occurred in 39% of patients with systemic JIA, often before IL-1 or IL-6 blockade. Eosinophilia was associated with adverse drug reactions and macrophage activation syndrome. There was 1 death, unrelated to active systemic JIA disease. ConclusionCarriage of DRB1*15 was more common in this cohort of patients with systemic JIA than in the general population. Eosinophilia and systemic JIA-LD were more common among patients with severe systemic JIA complicated by macrophage activation syndrome.

The fluorescent probe PEG-BTDAr targeting LDs was successfully prepared by the nucleophilic substitution reaction between the Heck coupling reaction product 3h and Amino polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Mn= 2000). PEG-BTDAr exhibited the advantages of high selectivity, good stability and pH resistance. The use of PEG as a substrate gave PEGBTDAr good biocompatibility.

Ecological, environmental conservation is facilitated by "green production" and the promotion of 100% renewable energy development goals." The 100% renewable energy development goal is hailed in the developed economies as a fresh set of policy initiatives that, primarily via the use of renewable energy and resource efficiency, seek to achieve social objectives, including socio-economic impacts and the reduction of economic inequality. This study examines the potential energy transition based on current technology and the green productivity of 40 industrialized nations from 1990 to 2020. In most industrialized nations, green growth is positive, efficiency change is negative and technology advancement is the primary factor behind economic and environmental improvement. Furthermore, our empirical findings show that trade between nations encourages green output in developed nations. The potential energy transition rate across industrialized nations is 5.21% on average. This suggests that, on average, 5.11% of each advanced nation's total energy usage can be changed from dirty to clean energy.

For instance, 3-membered N-heterocyclic compounds-such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines-possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The alpha-lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alpha-lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases 1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo- and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, this study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of alpha-lactam-based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.

In these cases, ectopic foci are accessible from the LV endocardium, epicardially from the middle cardiac vein as well as from the right atrium (RA). This study reports a series of patients with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) arising from the ISP-LV that were successfully ablated following access from different structures. Methods and ResultsFive patients (4 males, age 61 +/- 12.8 years) with PVCs arising from the ISP-LV were successfully ablated using three different approaches for ablation-endocardial, epicardial (through coronary sinus or its branches), and RA approaches. Endocardial LV mapping, RA, and coronary sinus (CS) mapping were performed in all five cases. PVCs demonstrated RBBB or LBBB-like morphology and left superior axis. The three patients ablated endocardially had a maximum deflection index (MDI) of 0.36, 0.43, and 0.54, whereas in the remaining 2 patients, MDI was 0.57 and both demonstrated QS morphology in the inferior leads. Local activation time at the successful ablation site was 35 +/- 8.9 (26-55) msec pre-QRS. Pacemapping at the successful ablation site resulted in a good (11/12) or perfect (12/12) QRS match in all cases. Three of the patients demonstrated frequent monomorphic PVCs of another morphology suggesting a remote exit site. All patients remained arrhythmia-free after a mean follow-up of 21 +/- 15 (6-36) months. ConclusionSuccessful ablation of PVCs from ISP-LV may require access from the CS or even RA apart from LV endocardial approach. Not infrequently patients demonstrate additional PVC foci.

In this study, we combine food web theory and a data set of 149 aquatic food webs to investigate the effect of complexity (i.e. species richness, connectance, and average interaction strength) on ecosystem productivity. We find that more complex ecosystems tend to be more productive, although different facets of complexity have contrasting effects. A higher species richness and/or average interaction strength increases productivity, whereas a higher connectance often decreases it. These patterns hold not only between realized complexity and productivity, but also characterize responses of productivity to simulated declines of complexity. Our model also predicts a negative association between productivity and stability along gradients of complexity. Empirical analyses support our predictions on positive complexity-productivity relationships and negative productivity-stability relationships. Our study provides a step forward towards reconciling ecosystem complexity, productivity and stability.

Rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients are the primary aims of the concerned authorities to minimize the casualties. The endeavor to mitigate the pandemic has been impeded by the emergence of newly identified genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2. Some of these variants are considered as serious threats because of their higher transmissibility and potential immune evasion, leading to reduced vaccine efficiency. Nanotechnology can play an important role in advancing both diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19. In this review, nanotechnology-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are introduced. The biological features and functions of the virus, the mechanism of infection, and currently used approaches for diagnosis, vaccination, and therapy are discussed. Then, nanomaterial-based nucleic acid- and antigen-targeting diagnostic methods and viral activity suppression approaches that have a strong potential to advance both diagnostics and therapeutics toward control and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic are focused upon.

Recently, monolayer Ising superconductor NbSe2 is shown to be an ideal platform for realizing an NTSC state. Through tight-binding calculations based on the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes Hamiltonian, it is demonstrated that the in-plane magnetic field B combined with superconducting pairing Delta(s), Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) V-r, and chemical potential mu can regulate the topological properties of the NTSC state. First, B larger than Delta(s) effectively induces an NTSC state with nodal points (NPs) located on the high-symmetry line of the Brillouin zone. The length of the resulting MFBs in the ribbon increases with B. Second, Rashba SOC greatly affects the number and locations of NPs by tilting bands near Fermi level (E-F), leading to unidirectional Majorana edge states. Finally, when B > Delta(s), mu affects the bulk band structure at E-F, resulting in an NTSC state with 6, 12, 18, 24 NPs and 0, 2, 3, 4 MFBs. These results are important to clarifying the behavior of the NTSC state under a B and designing a quantum computing platform based on exotic Majorana fermions.

Here, an alternative strategy to further control the piezoelectric properties by substituting the halogen atom (I/Br) in the CsPbX3 perovskite (X = Cl, Br) structure is adopted. A series of piezoelectric materials with excellent piezoelectric coefficients (d(33)) are unveiled. Iodine-incorporated CsPbBr2I demonstrates the record intrinsic piezoelectric response (d(33) approximate to 47 pC N-1) among all inorganic metal halide perovskites. This leads to an excellent electrical output power of approximate to 0.375 mW (24.8 mu W cm(-2) N-1) in the piezoelectric energy generator (PEG) which is higher than those of the pristine/mixed perovskite references with CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl). With its structural phase remaining unchanged, the strained CsPbBr2I retains its superior piezoelectricity in both thin film and nanocrystal powder forms, further demonstrating its repeatability and versatility of applications. The origin of high piezoelectricity is found to be due to halogen-induced anisotropic lattice strain in the unit-cell along the c-axis, and octahedral distortion. This study reveals an avenue to design new piezoelectric materials by modifying their halide constituents and paves the way to design efficient PEGs for improved electromechanical energy conversion.

In order to fulfill these tasks, Treg cells operate in secondary lymphoid tissues and nonlymphoid tissues. The conditions for Treg cell stability and for their modes of action are different according to their compartment of residence. In addition, Treg cells initiate residency programs to inhabit niches in nonlympoid tissues (NLT) in steady state and after re-establishment of previously deflected homeostasis for extended periods of time. These NLT Treg cells are different from lymphoid tissue residing Treg cells and are functionally specialized to subserve not only immune functions but support intrinsic functions of their tissue of residence. This review will highlight current ideas about the functional specialization of NLT Treg cells in particular in the central nervous system (CNS) and discuss challenges that we are facing in an effort to exploit the power of NLT Treg cells for maintenance of tissue homeostasis and perhaps also tissue regeneration.

Yet the combined effects of landscape composition and pollinator traits (especially specialisation) on pollination success remain hard to quantify empirically.We used an individual-based model to explore how landscape and pollinator specialisation (degree) interact to influence pollination. We modelled variation in the landscape by generating gradients of plant species intermixing-from no mixing to complete intermixing. Furthermore, we varied the level of pollinator specialisation by simulating plant-pollinator (six to eight species) networks of different connectance. We then compared the impacts of these drivers on three proxies for pollination: visitation rate, number of consecutive visits to the focal plant species and expected number of plants pollinated.We found that the spatial arrangements of plants and pollinator degree interact to determine pollination success, and that the influence of these drivers on pollination depends on how pollination is estimated. For most pollinators, visitation rate increases in more plant mixed landscapes. Compared to the two more functional measures of pollination, visitation rate overestimates pollination service. This is particularly severe in landscapes with high plant intermixing and for generalist pollinators. Interestingly, visitation rate is less influenced by pollinator traits (pollinator degree and body size) than are the two functional metrics, likely because 'visitation rate' ignores the order in which pollinators visit plants. However, the visitation sequence order is crucial for the expected number of plants pollinated, since only prior visits to conspecific individuals can contribute to pollination. We show here that this order strongly depends on the spatial arrangements of plants, on pollinator traits and on the interaction between them.Taken together, our findings suggest that visitation rate, the most commonly used proxy for pollination in network studies, should be complemented with more functional metrics which reflect the frequency with which individual pollinators revisit the same plant species. Our findings also suggest that measures of landscape structure such as plant intermixing and density-in combination with pollinators' level of specialism-can improve estimates of the probability of pollination.

Methyl acetate (MA) has proven to be a competitive low-temperature electrolyte solvent with low viscosity and low freezing point, but its interfacial stability is poor and remains elusive until now. Here, it is revealed thaat the reductive stability of MA-based electrolytes is fundamentally governed by the anion-prevailed solvation structure. Based on this framework, fluorobenzene is employed in the electrolyte to promote the entry of anions into the solvation shell via dipole-dipole interactions and the generation of free MA, thus enhancing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy of MA. The designed electrolyte enables LiCoO2 (LCO)/graphite cells to exhibit excellent cycling performance at -20 degrees C (90% retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C) and to remain 91% of their room-temperature capacity at a super-low temperature of -60 degrees C at 0.05 C. Thanks to the plentiful free MA, this electrolyte has a high conductivity (2.61 mS cm(-1)) at -60 degrees C and allows LCO/graphite cell to charge at -60 degrees C. This study offers the possibility of practical applications for those solvents with poor reductive stability and provides new approaches to designing advanced electrolytes for low-temperature applications.

This study aimed to analyze the levels of Met cycle-related metabolites and constructed a risk model to explore its association with the risk of MMD. MethodsIn this prospective study, a total of 302 adult MMD patients and 88 age-matched healthy individuals were consecutively recruited. The serum levels of Met cycle-related metabolites were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Participants were randomly divided into training set and testing set at a ratio of 1:1. The training set was used to construct the risk score model by LASSO regression. The association between Met cycle-related risk score and the risk of MMD was analyzed using logistic regression and assessed by ROC curves. The testing set was used for validation. ResultsThe levels of methionine sulfoxide and homocysteine were significantly increased, while the levels of betaine and choline were significantly decreased in MMD and its subtypes compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05 for all). The training set was used to construct the risk model and the risk score of each participant has been calculated. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk score was independently associated with the risk of MMD and its subtypes (p < 0.05 for all). We then divided the participants into low-risk and high-risk groups, the high-risk score was significantly associated with the risk of MMD and its subtypes (p < 0.05 for all). The risk scores were further assessed as tertiles, the highest tertile was significantly associated with a higher risk of MMD and its subtypes compared to the lowest (p < 0.05 for all). The results were validated in the testing set. ConclusionThis study has constructed and validated a risk model based on Met cycle-related metabolites, which was independently associated with the risk of MMD and its subtypes. The findings provided a new perspective on the risk evaluation and prevention of MMD.

This paper proposes a novel composite learning approach based on adaptive neural control. The focus of this approach is to make the NN approximate uncertainties in nonlinear systems quickly and accurately without identifying the constant optimal weights of the NN. Hence, the regressor does not need to satisfy the PE or IE conditions. In this paper, regressor filtering scheme is adopted to generate prediction error, and then the prediction error and tracking error simultaneously drive the update of NN weights. Under the framework of Lyapulov theory, the proposed composite learning approach can ensure that approximation error of the uncertainty and tracking error of the system states converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero exponentially. The simulation results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach in terms of fast approximation.

In this work, the effect of He+ irradiation on the magnetization reversal and on the domain wall dynamics of Pt/Co/AlOx trilayers is illustrated. Fluences up to 1.5 x 10(15) ions cm(-2) strongly decrease the PMA, without affecting neither the spontaneous magnetization nor the strength of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). This confirms experimentally the robustness of the DMI interaction against interfacial chemical intermixing, already predicted by theory. In parallel with the decrease of the PMA, a strong decrease of the domain wall depinning field is observed after irradiation. This allows the domain walls to reach large maximum velocities with a lower magnetic field compared to that needed for the pristine films. Decoupling PMA from DMI can, therefore, be beneficial for the design of low energy devices based on domain wall dynamics. When the samples are irradiated with larger He+ fluences, the magnetization gets close to the out-of-plane/in-plane reorientation transition, where approximate to 100nm size magnetic skyrmions are stabilized. It is observed that as the He+ fluence increases, the skyrmion size decreases while these magnetic textures become more stable against the application of an external magnetic field, as predicted by theoretical models developed for ultrathin films with labyrinthine domains.

MethodsAfter downloading transcriptomic datasets for colon cancer (CC) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), they were divided, in a 1:1 ratio, within training or test datasets. m6A-related lncRNAs were then scrutinized across such dataset using Pearson correlation assessment before generating a m6A-related lncRNAs prognosis-related model using the training dataset. The latter was then validated with the test and the whole dataset. In addition, we compared the differences of TIM and the estimated IC50 of drug response between the high- and low-risk groups. Results: Overall survival (OS) resulted as linked with 11 m6A-related lncRNAs, while within the developed prognosis-related model, areas-under-curves were as follows: within training dataset, values at 3-, 4-, and 5-years were 0.777, 0.819, and 0.805, accordingly, and for test one, they were 0.697, 0.682, and 0.706, respectively. Finally, the values for the whole dataset were 0.675 (3-year), 0.682 (4-years), and 0.679 (5-years), accordingly. Moreover, CC cases categorized within low-risk cohort demonstrated enhanced OS (p < .0001), lower metastasis (p = 2e-06) and lower T stage (p = .0067), more instability for microsatellite status (p = .012), and downregulation for PD-L1, PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG3, and HAVCR2 (p < .05). In addition, risk scorings were significantly linked to the degree of infiltrative intensity for CD8 and CD4 (memory resting) T-cells, T-regulatory (Tregs), and Mast cells triggering (p < .05). Patients with low infiltrative propensity for CD4 T-cells also had better OS (p = .016). Moreover, six representative drugs were found to be sensitive for treating CC patients. Conclusion: A robust m6A-related prognostic model with great performances was developed before exploring the TIM characteristics and its potential therapeutic drugs, which might improve the prognosis and therapeutic efficacy.

Staphylococcus aureus remains a formidable human pathogen with high mortality rates associated with severe systemic infections. S. aureus has become notorious as a multidrug resistant bacterium, which when combined with its extensive arsenal of virulence factors that exacerbate disease, culminates in an incredibly challenging pathogen to treat clinically. Compounding this major health issue is the lack of antibiotic discovery and development, with only two new classes of antibiotics approved for clinical use in the last 20 years. Combined efforts from the scientific community have reacted to the threat of dwindling treatment options to combat S. aureus disease in several innovative and exciting developments.

Identification of key molecules specific to SCs and nerve fibers may provide new therapeutic targets for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Argonaute2 (Ago2) is a key molecular player that mediates the activity of miRNA-guided mRNA cleavage and miRNA stability. Our study found that Ago2 knockout (Ago2-KO) in proteolipid protein (PLP) lineage SCs in mice resulted in a significant reduction of nerve conduction velocities and impairments of thermal and mechanical sensitivities. Histopathological data revealed that Ago2-KO significantly induced demyelination and neurodegeneration. When DPN was induced in both wild-type and Ago2-KO mice, Ago2-KO mice exhibited further decreased myelin thickness and exacerbated neurological outcomes compared with wild-type mice. Deep sequencing analysis of Ago2 immunoprecipitated complexes showed that deregulated miR-206 in Ago2-KO mice is highly related to mitochondrial function. In vitro data showed that knockdown of miR-200 induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in SCs. Together, our data suggest that Ago2 in SCs is essential to maintain peripheral nerve function while ablation of Ago2 in SCs exacerbates SC dysfunction and neuronal degeneration in DPN. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of DPN.

Nevertheless, as biological experiments are often measured with a relatively small number of samples, how to accurately estimate the variances of gene expression becomes a challenging issue. To tackle this problem, we introduce a regularized t distribution and derive its statistical properties including the probability density function and the moment generating function. The noncentral regular-ized t distribution is also introduced for computing the statistical power of hypothesis testing. For practical applications, we apply the regularized t distribution to establish the null distribution of the regularized t statistic, and then formulate it as a regularized t-test for detecting the differentially expressed genes. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that our regularized t-test performs much better than the Bayesian t-test in the "limma" package, in particular when the sample sizes are small.

Herein, by incorporating mono- or bi-dentate coordination mode ligands as chiral source, the self-assembly of four pairs of chiral hybrid Cu(I)-based iodides, namely, (R/S)-Cu4I4(Hmpy)(4)center dot H2O (R/S-1), (R/S)-Cu4I4(3Hpy)(4) (R/S-2), (R/S)-Cu4I4(2MePI)(4) (R/S-3), and (R/S)-Cu4I4(3AD)(4) (R/S-4) (where R/S-Hmpy = R/S-2-pyrrolidinemethanol, R/S-3Hpy = R/S-3-hydroxypyrrolidine, R/S-2MePI = R/S-2-methylpiperazine, and R/S-3AD = R/S-3-aminopiperidine), are reported. With the monodentate and bidentate ligands, these materials belong to two different structural types: 0D molecular clusters (R/S-1, R/S-2) and 3D porous metal-organic frameworks (R/S-3, R/S-4). These materials all crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups containing similar basic Cu4I4 cubane tetramer building units but with different coordination modes. They are also semiconductors, with optical bandgaps ranging from 2.70 to 2.94 eV. The photoluminescence (PL) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions are further characterized, where the highest PLQY of approximate to 95% and CPL dissymmetry factor (g(lum)) of approximate to 7 x 10(-3) are achieved in R/S-1. This work offers a systematic comparison between different structural types with similar building blocks, bridging by the flexible chiral ligands, and shows that the hybrid copper iodides are highly promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics and chiroptics.

However, a smooth voltage curve can be obtained by suppression of the Na+-vacancy ordering, and therefore, transition metal slabs do not need to be more multi-element than necessary. Here, the Na+-vacancy ordering is found to be disturbed by dual substitution of Ti-IV for Mn-IV and Zn-II for Ni-II in P2-Na-2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O-2. Dual-substituted Na-2/3[Ni1/4Mn1/2Ti1/6Zn1/12]O-2 demonstrates almost non-step voltage curves with a reversible capacity of 114 mAh g(-1) and less structural changes with a high crystalline structure maintained during charging and discharging. Synchrotron X-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction measurements reveal that dual-substitution with Ti-IV and Zn-II uniquely promotes in-plane Ni-II-Mn-IV ordering, which is quite different from the disordered mixing in conventional multiple metal substitution.

For subambient cooling in hot humid subtropical/tropical climates, achieving ultrahigh solar reflectance (>= 96%), durable ultraviolet (UV) resistance, and surface superhydrophobicity simultaneously is critical, which, however, is challenging for most state-of-the-art scalable polymer-based coolers. Here an organic-inorganic tandem structure is reported to address this challenge, which comprises a bottom high-refractive-index polyethersulfone (PES) cooling layer with bimodal honeycomb pores, an alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticle UV reflecting layer with superhydrophobicity, and a middle UV absorption layer of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles, thus providing thorough protection from UV and self-cleaning capability together with outstanding cooling performance. The PES-TiO2-Al2O3 cooler demonstrates a record-high solar reflectance of over 0.97 and high mid-infrared emissivity of 0.92, which can maintain their optical properties intact even after equivalent 280-day UV exposure despite the UV-sensitivity of PES. This cooler achieves a subambient cooling temperature up to 3 degrees C at summer noontime and 5 degrees C at autumn noontime without solar shading or convection cover in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. This tandem structure can be extended to other polymer-based designs, offering a UV-resist but reliable radiative cooling solution in hot humid climates.

Variants located on the AG/GT consensus splice sites are usually considered as responsible of splicing defects, but exonic or intronic variants located outside of the consensus splice site can also lead to abnormal splicing. We investigated the putative consequences on splicing of 11 CACNA1A variants of unknown significance (VUS) identified in patients with episodic ataxia or congenital ataxia. In silico splice predictions were performed and RNA obtained from fibroblasts was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. The presence of abnormal transcripts was confirmed in 10/11 patients, nine of them were considered as deleterious and one remained of unknown significance. Targeted next-generation RNA sequencing was done in a second step to compare the two methods. This method was successful to obtain the full cDNA sequence of CACNA1A. Despite the presence of several isoforms in the fibroblastic cells, it detected most of the abnormally spliced transcripts. In conclusion, RNA sequencing was efficient to confirm the pathogenicity of nine novel CACNA1A variants. Sanger or Next generation methods can be used depending on the facilities and organization of the laboratories.

MethodsA total of 34 patients (case group) with mild coronary artery stenosis and 36 sex and age matched patients (control group) without coronary artery stenosis according to coronary angiogram were prospectively enrolled. The total energy loss (ELt), basal segment energy loss (ELb), middle segment energy loss (ELm), apical segment energy loss (ELa), energy loss reserve (EL-r), and energy loss reserve rate were recorded in the isovolumic systolic period (S1), rapid ejection period (S2), slow ejection period (S3), isovolumic diastolic period (D1), rapid filling period (D2), slow filling period (D3), and atrial contraction period (D4). ResultsCompared with the control group, some of the EL in the resting case group were higher; some of the EL in the case group were lower after exercise, and those during D1 ELb and D3 ELb were higher. Compared with the resting state, the total EL and the EL within the time segment in the control group were higher after exercise, except during D2 ELb. In the case group, except for during D1 ELt, ELb and D2 ELb, the total and segmental EL of each phase was mostly higher after exercise (p < .05). Compared with the control group, most of the EL-r and EL reserve rates in the case group were lower (p < .05). ConclusionThe EL, EL-r, and energy loss reserve rate have a certain value in the evaluation of cardiac function in patients with mild coronary artery stenosis.

Somatotype altitudinal variation and its relationship with the nutritional status of children in the Jujuy province, Argentina	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article							X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY; BODY-MASS INDEX; GROWTH; ADOLESCENTS; OBESITY; HERITABILITY; PREVALENCE; OVERWEIGHT; COMPONENTS; FAT	ObjectivesTo study the somatotype variations adjusted by altitude, age, sex, and BMI categories, and to assess the health status of the children population. MethodsA sample of 460 children aged 8-13 years was assessed in a cross-sectional study conducted on anthropometric measurements between 2011 and 2015. Data were categorized into two age groups: Group 8-10, Group 11-13 and two altitudes: Highland (>2000 masl), lowland (<2000 masl). The somatotypic profile was determined by the Heath and Carter's study method and the Body Mass Index was used to assess children nutritional status. Generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVM) were performed to test the association between somatotype and geographic altitude. Individual age-sex specific somatotypes were plotted in a two-dimension somatochart, and group dispersion was displayed by the somatotype attitudinal mean. ResultsThe sample has an overall endomorph-mesomorph body type, exhibiting different patterns when altitude and sex were considered. The GLLVM showed that the whole somatotype was different by altitude. Highland children occupied central to endomorphic-mesomorphic places in the somatochart with lower variation. In both altitudes, girls exhibited higher endomorphy than boys. Several discrepancies between the BMI categorization and the somatotype were observed. ConclusionsJujenean children show differential body patterns across geographic altitude which exhibit age and sex variations. Children have a differential tendency to a fat mass gain. The BMI showed some inconsistencies with somatotype, leading to a misclassification of the child nutritional status, this highlights the importance of not to treat the BMI in isolation but with other determinants of the health status.

Uncertainty-adjusted forecast errors are either comparable or smaller during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Investor attention and price reactions to analyst forecast revisions are higher during the pandemic and the effect is stronger in periods where investors actively search for information about firms. During the pandemic, investors value analyst price discovery role more than their role in interpreting public information. Jointly, the results suggest that analysts play an important information intermediation role during the COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDIES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						echo sorting; geometry from echoes; shape reconstruction		Assume that a ground-based vehicle moves in a room with walls or other planar surfaces. Can the vehicle reconstruct the positions of the walls from the echoes of a single sound event? We assume that the vehicle carries some microphones and that a loudspeaker is either also mounted on the vehicle or placed at a fixed location in the room. We prove that the reconstruction is almost always possible if (1) no echoes are received from floors, ceilings, or sloping walls and the vehicle carries at least three noncollinear microphones, or if (2) walls of any inclination may occur, the loudspeaker is fixed in the room and there are four noncoplanar microphones. The difficulty lies in the echo-matching problem: How to determine which echoes come from the same wall. We solve this by using a Cayley-Menger determinant. Our proofs use methods from computational commutative algebra.

Genomics reveal the origins and current structure of a genetically depauperate freshwater species in its introduced Alaskan range	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						dispersal; Esox lucius; gene flow; invasive species; northern pike; population genetics	NORTHERN PIKE; POSTGLACIAL DISPERSAL; POPULATIONS; FISH; SALMONIDS; PATTERNS; INVASION; PACKAGE; SAMPLES; FORMAT	Invasive species are a major threat to global biodiversity, yet also represent large-scale unplanned ecological and evolutionary experiments to address fundamental questions in nature. Here we analyzed both native and invasive populations of predatory northern pike (Esox lucius) to characterize landscape genetic variation, determine the most likely origins of introduced populations, and investigate a presumably postglacial population from Southeast Alaska of unclear provenance. Using a set of 4329 SNPs from 351 individual Alaskan northern pike representing the most widespread geographic sampling to date, our results confirm low levels of genetic diversity in native populations (average ?? of 3.18 x 10(-4)) and even less in invasive populations (average ?? of 2.68 x 10(-4)) consistent with bottleneck effects. Our analyses indicate that invasive northern pike likely came from multiple introductions from different native Alaskan populations and subsequently dispersed from original introduction sites. At the broadest scale, invasive populations appear to have been founded from two distinct regions of Alaska, indicative of two independent introduction events. Genetic admixture resulting from introductions from multiple source populations may have mitigated the negative effects associated with genetic bottlenecks in this species with naturally low levels of genetic diversity. Genomic signatures strongly suggest an excess of rare, population-specific alleles, pointing to a small number of founding individuals in both native and introduced populations consistent with a species' life history of limited dispersal and gene flow. Lastly, the results strongly suggest that a small isolated population of pike, located in Southeast Alaska, is native in origin rather than stemming from a contemporary introduction event. Although theory predicts that lack of genetic variation may limit colonization success of novel environments, we detected no evidence that a lack of standing variation limited the success of this genetically depauperate apex predator.

Here, we examine the impact of intensive acai palm (Euterpe oleracea) management on the seed rain and soil seed bank in an estuarine forest landscape with a long history of forest management by locals in the Amazon region. Seed rain (100 80 cm(2) collectors) and soil seed bank (100 30 cm(2) samples) were monitored through a year across 20 forest stands, covering a gradient of acai stem density (50-3575 acai stems per ha). Seed rain and bank were dominated by acai seeds (85.5%-85.8%) and by excluding them, seed rain and bank were low density and species poor, capturing a tiny subset from the local (17.91%-19.40%) and landscape woody flora (11.82%-14.55%). Moreover, autochthonous and vertebrated-dispersed predominated as well as those from tree species considered useful by locals. Overall, acai stem density positively affected acai seed abundance in the seed rain and negatively affected seed pools in the bank in relation to abundance of seeds and vertebrated dispersed, while adult tree species richness and density and accessibility to forest stands were associated with more diversified seed pools. Thereby, forest stands are exposed to different levels of acai management (high vs. low intensity) supported taxonomically distinct seed pools. Our results suggest that acai intensification disturbs seed rain and soil seed bank with potential impacts on forest regeneration and the forest integrity standards required to consider acai fruit production as sustainable according to current legislation.

J	Edwards, V; Salkovskis, PM; Bream, V				Edwards, Victoria; Salkovskis, Paul M.; Bream, Victoria			Do they really care? Specificity of social support issues in hoarding disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						hoarding; loneliness; obsessive-compulsive disorder; social support; thwarted belongingness	TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS; EXPRESSED EMOTION; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY; VALIDATION; INVENTORY; SYMPTOMS; HEALTH; SCALE; IMPAIRMENT	Objectives: Unmet interpersonal needs may play a role in excessive emotional attachments to objects for people with hoarding disorder (HD). Previous research indicates that social support (but not attachment difficulties) may be specific to HD. The study aimed to evaluate social networks and support in HD relative to clinical controls with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy controls (HC). The secondary aim was to explore the extent of loneliness and thwarted belongingness. Potential mechanisms for deficits in social support were also considered. Design: A cross-sectional between-groups design was used to compare scores on measures in those with HD (n = 37); OCD (n = 31); and HCs (n = 45). Methods: Participants completed a structured clinical interview by telephone (to assign diagnostic categories) followed by online questionnaires. Results: Whilst individuals with HD and OCD both report smaller social networks than HC, lower levels of perceived social support appear to be specific to HD. The HD group also showed higher levels of loneliness and thwarted belonging compared to OCD and HC. No differences were found between groups for perceived criticism or trauma. Conclusions: The results support previous findings of lower levels of self-reported social support within HD. Loneliness and thwarted belongingness also appear significantly elevated within HD compared with OCD and HC.

J	Efatmaneshnik, M; Chitsaz, N; Qiao, L				Efatmaneshnik, Mahmoud; Chitsaz, Nasim; Qiao, Li			Decision making for multi-objective problems: Mean and median metrics	SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						Chebychev norm; mean; median; multi-objective optimization; Pareto solutions	OPTIMIZATION	When dealing with problems with more than two objectives, sophisticated multi-objective optimization algorithms might be needed. Pareto optimization, which is based on the concept of dominated and non-dominated solutions, is the most widely utilized method when comparing solutions within a multi-objective setting. However, in the context of optimization, where three or more objectives are involved, the effectiveness of Pareto dominance approaches to drive the solutions to convergence is significantly compromised as more and more solutions tend to be non-dominated by each other. This in turn reduces the selection pressure, especially for algorithms that rely on evolving a population of solutions such as evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, etc. The size of the non-dominated set of trade-off solutions can be quite large, rendering the decision-making process difficult if not impossible. The size of the non-dominated solution set increases exponentially with an increase in the number of objectives. This paper aims to expand a framework for coping with many/multi-objective and multidisciplinary optimization problems through the introduction of a min-max metric that behaves like a median measure that can locate the center of a data set. We compare this metric to the Chebyshev norm L_infinity metric that behaves like a mean measure in locating the center of a data set. The median metric is introduced in this paper for the first time, and unlike the mean metric is independent of the data normalization method. These metrics advocate balanced, natural, and minimum compromise solutions about all objectives. We also demonstrate and compare the behavior of the two metrics for a Tradespace case study involving more than 1200 CubeSat design alternatives identifying a manageable set of potential solutions for decision-makers.

Because of the high speed, a large analog bandwidth is required. The short exposure times result in small signal levels which require noiseless detection. Both requirements cannot be met by state-of-the-art conventional CMOS technology of near-infrared arrays as has been attempted previously. A total of five near-infrared SAPHIRA 320 x 256 pixel HgCdTe e(-)APD arrays have been deployed in the wavefront sensors and in the fringe tracker of the VLTI instrument GRAVITY. The current limiting magnitude for coherent exposures with GRAVITY is m(k) = 19, which is made possible with ADP technology. New avalanche photo-diode array (APD) developments since GRAVITY include the extension of the spectral sensitivity to the wavelength range from 0.8 to 2.5 mu m. After GRAVITY a larger format array with 512 x 512 pixels has been developed for both AO applications at the ELT and for long integration times. Since dark currents of <10(-3) e(-)/s have been demonstrated with 1Kx1K e(-)APD arrays and 2Kx2K e(-)APD arrays have already been developed, the possibilities and adaptations of e(-)APD technology to provide noiseless large-format science-grade arrays for long integration times are also discussed.

The presence of Sn2+ and Sn4+ species was identified through XPS and TEM; the homogeneous distribution of tin on the support throughout the surface of the coating was verified by SEM analysis. Taylor flow regime and the kinetic control of the reaction were verified with hydrodynamic studies. A determination coefficient of 0.92 was obtained for the mathematical adjustment of the equation that described the reaction pathway obtained under the assumption of a dual-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood formalism with product desorption as the limiting step.

In this article, MWNCTs were covalently modified by 4,4'-difluorobenzophenone (DB) to allow temperature-tolerant functional groups on the walls. These surface-functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNTs-DB) were then attached to poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) resins by in situ grafting polymerization, to prepare high-strength PEEK nanocomposites. The addition of 1 wt% MWCNTs-DB improved the tensile and flexural strength of the PEEK nanocomposite by 28% and 22%, respectively, compared with pristine PEEK. In particular, the optimal break at strain of the PEEK nanocomposites reaches 39%. The glass transition temperature of the PEEK nanocomposites increased from 148 to 153 degrees C, indicating strong interfacial interactions between MWNCTs and PEEK. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy images confirmed the amelioration of MWNCTs dispersion in PEEK resins achieved by in situ grafting polymerization. Our results demonstrate the potential of surface-functionalized carbon nanotubes for use in high-temperature applications and offer innovative protocols for designing and preparing high-performance nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical properties, which could have applications in various fields such as aerospace, automotive, and biomedical engineering.

However, OHPs currently suffer from the lack of efficient doping methods, while the traditional method of atomistic doping having clear limitations in the achievable doping range. While doping with molecular dopants, has been suggested as a solution to this problem, the action of these dopants is typically restricted to perovskite surfaces, therefore significantly reducing their doping potential. In this study, successful bulk inclusion of "magic blue", a molecular dopant, into 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites is reported. This doping strategy of immersing the perovskite film in dopant solution increases the electrical current up to approximate to 60 times while maintaining clean film surface. A full mechanistic picture of such immersion doping is provided, in which the solvent molecule facilitates bulk diffusion of dopant molecule inside the organic spacer layer. Physical criteria for judicious choice of solvents in immersion doping are developed based on readily available solvent properties. The immersion doping method developed in this study that enables bulk molecular doping in OHPs will provide a strategic doping methodology for controlling electrical properties of OHPs for electronic and optoelectronic devices.

J	Linley, S; Reisner, E				Linley, Stuart; Reisner, Erwin			Floating Carbon Nitride Composites for Practical Solar Reforming of Pre-Treated Wastes to Hydrogen Gas	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						biomass; floating catalyst; plastic; scaling; solar fuels; solar reforming	VISIBLE-LIGHT-DRIVEN; PHOTOCATALYST; FUEL; GENERATION; CONVERSION; FEEDSTOCK; EVOLUTION; PRODUCTS; REMOVAL; BIOMASS	Solar reforming (SR) is a promising green-energy technology that can use sunlight to mitigate biomass and plastic waste while producing hydrogen gas at ambient pressure and temperature. However, practical challenges, including photocatalyst lifetime, recyclability, and low production rates in turbid waste suspensions, limit SR's industrial potential. By immobilizing SR catalyst materials (carbon nitride/platinum; CNx|Pt and carbon nitride/nickel phosphide; CNx|Ni2P) on hollow glass microspheres (HGM), which act as floating supports enabling practical composite recycling, such limitations can be overcome. Substrates derived from plastic and biomass, including poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and cellulose, are reformed by floating SR composites, which are reused for up to ten consecutive cycles under realistic, vertical simulated solar irradiation (AM1.5G), reaching activities of 1333 +/- 240 mu mol(H2) m(-2) h(-1) on pre-treated PET. Floating SR composites are also advantageous in realistic waste where turbidity prevents light absorption by non-floating catalyst powders, achieving 338.1 +/- 1.1 mu mol(H2) m(-2) h(-1) using floating CNx versus non-detectable H-2 production with non-floating CNx and a pre-treated PET bottle as substrate. Low Pt loadings (0.033 +/- 0.0013% m/m) demonstrate consistent performance and recyclability, allowing efficient use of precious metals for SR hydrogen production from waste substrates at large areal scale (217 cm(2)), taking an important step toward practical SR implementation.

Here, we present a gold(I)-catalyzed C(sp(3))-H activation of 1-bromoalkynes without any sort of electronic, or conformational bias. The reaction proceeds regiospecifically and stereospecifically to the corresponding bromocyclopentene derivatives. The latter can be readily modified, comprising an excellent library of diverse 3D scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. In addition, a mechanistic study has shown that the reaction proceeds via a so far unknown mechanism: a concerted [1,5]-H shift / C-C bond formation involving a gold-stabilized vinylcation-like transition state.

The effect of the Zn concentration on the physical properties of ZnS is investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometer, photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy. XRD shows a preferential orientation along the (111) direction corresponding to the ZnS cubic structure. Based on the XRD results, it is seen that low zinc concentrations compared to sulfur content can increase the crystalline quality of films. Raman spectra confirm the presence of the ZnS cubic structure observed by XRD and show the presence of sprayed ZnS vibrational modes for all films. PL emission spectrum of ZnS confirms the presence of Zn and S atoms at all molar concentrations. SEM reveals densely packed and uniformly distributed grains with precise shapes. The elemental analysis confirms the growth of stochiometric Zn/S ratio. The optical analysis shows a high transmittance around 88% in the visible range of the solar spectrum with optical band gaps varying from 3.4 to 3.6 eV. These properties are interesting and show that ZnS thin films can be used as buffer layers in thin film solar cells applications.

Such symptoms substantially affect food and eating-cornerstones for both nutrition-related health outcomes and for quality of life. Based on this, this scoping review aimed to map out existing scientific literature on food-related experiences and related behavioral responses among people affected by chemosensory dysfunctions following COVID-19. A librarian-supported search of PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus for publications written in English (2020 to April 26, 2022) was conducted. Two authors searched for and screened publications and three others extracted and collated data. These are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Of 1169 hits, 9 publications were included in the review. The results are thematized as "Psychological and social aspects" and "Nutritional aspects," each with the subsections "Experiences" and "Behavioral responses." A great variety of food-related problems, nutritional and mental health effects, and implications for social life are identified. People affected by chemosensory dysfunctions following COVID-19 suffer, as evident both in stories from qualitative studies and in measurements of quality of life. The results impact all professions who are and may come to be involved in treating these patients, such as nurses, physicians, dietitians, and psychologists. With more knowledge about the dysfunctions' manifestation, duration, and impact on everyday life, multiprofessional teams need to collaborate in supporting patients medically, psychosocially, and nutritionally.

J	Nielsen, K; Yarker, J				Nielsen, Karina; Yarker, Jo			Thrivers, survivors or exiteers: A longitudinal, interpretative phenomenological analysis of the post-return-to-work journeys for workers with common mental disorders	APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE			English	Article; Early Access						common mental health; IGLOo framework; Longitudinal Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis; sustainable return to work; work psychology	QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; SICKNESS ABSENCE; RESOURCES; HEALTH; INTERVENTION; CONSERVATION; EMPLOYEES; BACK	The research on return to work for workers with common mental disorders has primarily focused on the pre-return journey. Relapses and recurrent sick leaves are prevalent and call for research on how we can support workers stay and thrive at work after long-term sickness absence due to common mental disorders. In the present study, we used Longitudinal Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore the experiences of returned workers' post-return journey and the barriers and facilitators to staying and thriving at work. We conducted monthly semistructured interviews with seven returned workers over a period of 4 months. We identified three post-return trajectories: the thrivers, the survivors and the exiteers. We identified 10 higher order themes and 13 subthemes that influenced these trajectories. At the individual level, wanting to make a valuable contribution and job crafting facilitated a sustainable return. At the group level, we identified social support as a facilitator. At the leader level, line managers making work adjustments and recognising workers as valuable were important, whereas a lack of understanding and conflicts with senior management posed as barriers. At the overarching level, the media influenced organisational values. Our findings have important implications for how organisations can facilitate a whole systems approach to support returned workers and prevent sickness absence reoccurrence and job loss.

While it is straightforward to calculate the views or "likes" from a particular campaign to benchmark performance, analyzing consumers' comments on luxury brands' dynamic video content presents a challenge due to the unstructured nature of natural language and large comment volumes. Previous studies utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have not adequately examined the impact of brand types, brand luxuriousness, and consumer diversity. To address this research gap, this article tests a conceptual framework with over 29,000 comments from 88 YouTube campaigns for nine luxury brands using a combination of automatic text and image analyses. The results indicate significant differences in comments' psycholinguistic nature depending on the brand's luxuriousness (premium, prestige, and exquisite) and Copelandian classification (convenience, shopping, and specialty), as well as consumers' demographic characteristics (age, gender, and ethnicity). These findings suggest that brand managers can use machine learning and AI methods to better tailor dynamic content creation to further engage diverse target segments by refining the campaign message to encourage additional engagement.

This study considers whether these impacts may be attenuated if an individual views their work as a spiritual calling. Using data from a nationally representative survey (N = 9,907), our analysis shows that perceived work discrimination due to race, gender, and religion are all independently associated with less job satisfaction net of a variety of other measures. Viewing work as a spiritual calling is associated with greater job satisfaction, even when accounting for traditional measures of religiosity. The negative impact of perceived discrimination on job satisfaction is weaker among those who view work as a spiritual calling. These findings provide evidence of the mechanisms underlying job satisfaction and have implications for understanding how religion might help mitigate the negative consequences of perceived discrimination in the workplace, or allow discrimination to potentially go unaddressed.

Patients and methodsHPR and MMO cutoff values (0.54 and 40.7 mm) divided patients into two groups. To develop the novel HPR-MMO index, four combinations of these factors were tested for predictive power: Group 1: HPR > 0.54 and MMO > 40.7 mm; Group 2: HPR <= 0.54 but MMO > 40.7 mm; Group 3: HPR > 0.54 but MMO <= 40.7 mm; Group 4: HPR <= 0.54 and MMO <= 40.7 mm. ResultsData of 198 patients with LA-NPC was analyzed retrospectively. RIT rates for Groups 1 to 4 were 10.2%, 15.2%, 25%, and 59.4%. Groups 2 and 3 were merged to generate HPR-MMO index because of statistically equivalent RIT rates: Low-risk: HPR > 0.54 and MMO > 40.7 mm; Intermediate-risk: HPR <= 0.54 but MMO > 40.7 mm or; HPR > 0.54 but MMO <= 40.7 mm; High-risk: HPR <= 0.54 and MMO <= 40.7 mm. It was revealed that the low-, high-, and intermediate-risk group's RIT rates; 10.2%, 59.4%, and 19.2%, respectively. ConclusionThe novel HPR-MMO index may to classify LA-NPC patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk RIT groups.

Therefore, the anatomical elements forming it bear significant clinical relevance. However, the exact relations between the elements that form its roof are still debated in the neuroanatomical literature; the inferior medullary velum, and the ventricle's median aperture in particular. In some atlases, the inferior medullary velum is placed in the midline, while in others, it is placed in the transverse plane. The median aperture is also displayed in different ways in midsagittal drawings: as a round perforation of a midline velum, as a foramen in an uncharacterized part of the ventricle, and as a gap between the nodule and the brainstem. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the different descriptions of the fourth ventricle, in order to gain a clearer understanding of the ventricular system's structure.

Despite the recent advancements in drug development, most patients with MM eventually relapse and the disease remains incurable. RNA therapy delivered via lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) has the potential to be a promising cancer treatment, however, its clinical implementation is limited due to inefficient delivery to non-hepatic tissues. Here, targeted (t)LNPs designed for delivery of RNA payload to MM cells are presented. The tLNPs consist of a novel ionizable lipid and are coated with an anti-CD38 antibody (alpha CD38-tLNPs). To explore their therapeutic potential, it is demonstrated that LNPs encapsulating small interference RNA (siRNA) against cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 (CKAP5) lead to a approximate to 90% decrease in cell viability of MM cells in vitro. Next, a new xenograft MM mouse model is employed, which clinically resembles the human disease and demonstrates efficient homing of MM cells to the BM. Specific delivery of alpha CD38-tLNPs to BM-residing and disseminated MM cells and the improvement in therapeutic outcome of MM-bearing mice treated with alpha CD38-tLNPs-siRNA-CKAP5 are shown. These results underscore the potential of RNA therapeutics for treatment of MM and the importance of developing effective targeted delivery systems and reliable preclinical models.

Variation in mycorrhizal communities and the level of mycoheterotrophy in grassland and Forest populations of <i>Neottia ovata</i> (Orchidaceae)	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecophysiology; evolutionary ecology; metabarcoding; mixotrophy; mycorrhizal symbiosis; orchid mycorrhiza; partial mycoheterotrophy; stable isotope signatures	SYMBIOTIC GERMINATION; SPECIES ORCHIDACEAE; CARBON GAIN; NIDUS-AVIS; FUNGI; PLANTS; EVOLUTION; GREEN; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SEBACINALES	Orchid mycorrhiza forms unique symbiotic associations between members of the Orchidaceae and multiple ecological guilds of fungi. Because orchids associate with a wide variety of fungi with different ecological functions, they represent an ideal study system to address fundamental questions about the evolution and ecophysiology of mycorrhizal symbiosis. Although it is well established that shifts in mycorrhizal associations are linked to transitions in plant trophic mode, it remains unclear what ecological drivers promote these evolutionary changes. Here, we investigated mycorrhizal communities and isotope signatures across six populations of the terrestrial orchid Neottia ovata growing under contrasting light conditions in temperate Europe. We hypothesized that plants growing in forests would associate with different mycorrhizal fungi than plants occurring in grasslands and that the limited light availability in forests leads to a higher contribution of fungi to the carbon budget of orchids. Our results showed that N. ovata predominantly associated with rhizoctonia fungi of the family Serendipitaceae in both habitats, but plants in forests also recruited ectomycorrhizal fungi. Root communities highly resembled soil communities and variation in root communities was significantly related to habitat type and edaphic factors. In contrast, isotope signatures (C-13, N-15, H-2 and O-18) and N concentration showed no significant relationship with habitat type. In addition, both C-13 and H-2 were not significantly correlated to habitat's light availability. Although it has been suggested that the presence of a wide variety of ectomycorrhizal fungi in root communities of orchids can serve as a precursor for evolutionary shifts to partial mycoheterotrophy (mixotrophy), the presence or absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi did not substantially influence the isotope signatures of N. ovata. These results indicate that rhizoctonia fungi played the major functional role in C and nutrient supply and that ectomycorrhizal fungi did not substantially contribute to the carbon budget of the plants.

Therefore, In-based alloys have been extensively employed to improve performance. However, the effects of alterations in surface elemental composition and interfacial electronic structure have not been investigated in detail. In this study, we introduced In and In-based alloys (InGaAg, InSn, and InSnBi) electrodes for EC CO2 RR. The experimental conditions employed in the demonstrated tests encompass various factors, such as applied potentials, electrolytes and their concentrations, as well as the effects of light, including UV and infrared light radiation. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed formate production with high FE (97.7 %) and selectivity (98.5 %). Minor amounts of CO, CH4, and H-2 were also detected by gas chromatography. Depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to examine the effects of alloying, potential-induced exposed surface elemental compositions, and interfacial electronic structures. The study found that the elemental distribution was substantially altered after EC CO2 RR. These unique results provide valuable information for the improvement and theoretical modeling of In-based alloy electrocatalysts for CO2 recycling.

In this study, tunable hybrid plasmon resonances (HPR) of sodium metasurfaces through heat-initiated structural transformation is experimentally demonstrated. A HPR is formed by coupling surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) and gap plasmon resonances (GPR), whose resonant wavelengths are highly sensitive to gaseous nanogaps. By carefully manipulating the thermo-assisted spin-coating process and post-thermal treatment, tuning of the HPR is achieved because of the phase transition between the antidome and nanodome structural profiles of liquid sodium inside the patterned fused silica substrates. Furthermore, the figure of merit of the heat initiated variable structure-spectrum is demonstrated that is highly dependent on the size of the substrate patterns, based on which temperature-sensitive plasmonic color and "invisible ink" of sodium metasurfaces are demonstrated. These findings can lead to new solutions for manipulating low-cost and high-performance active plasmonic devices.

In modern radar signal sorting based on pulse repetition interval, conventional methods usually fail to achieve acceptable accuracy and lack stable performance for two main reasons: (1) Conventional methods require a large number of pulses in the stream, which is not practical in many applications. (2) These methods are sensitive to pulse loss and random noise pulses. These two reasons are the main problem that is addressed in this paper. Our proposed model is a machine learning architecture called Unified Residual Recurrent Neural Network (URRNN). In this architecture, residual neural network and recurrent neural network are combined and modified to alleviate the forementioned shortcomings of traditional approaches and enhance the model performance in both classification and deinterleaving tasks. This aim is achieved due to the fact that URRNN extracts both spatial and temporal features, which means more information about processed stream that is exploited to enhance model performance. Three different architectural combinations of URRNN, which show high accuracy and reasonable processing time, are built and trained. The structural and functional description are provided for each architecture. Simulation demonstrates high accuracy and reliable performance of the proposed methods in different circumstances. The results are compared with the results obtained by other conventional machine learning techniques.

Preparation and Characterization of Biodegradable Cellulose Acetate-Fibroin for Dialysis Application	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Cellulose Acetate; Dialysis; Fibroin; Membranes; Protein	EXCHANGE MEMBRANES; WATER	Membrane separation technology is an efficient and high-performance technique. It is a thin flat sheet and acts like a delicate barrier for the selective transport of substances under the influence of pressure. Low cost and various applications in industry as well as in medical make it more important. The basic property of a dialysis membrane is the ability to remove toxic materials from blood in minimum time, and maximum protein rejection, and must have the ability to moderate the water flux. Protein deposition or adsorption on the surface of the membrane results in low flux and change of selectivity of membrane for low toxic removal. In this work we prepared cellulose acetate membrane through the phase inversion method. The effects of additives are characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR), and Contact Angle. The membrane performance is also studied in pure water flux, water uptakes, porosity, BSA rejection, and Urea clearance test. This membrane is modified by adding various types of organic and inorganic additives which will perform specific functions. M-3 membrane showed excellent results its hydrophilicity is 133.33 %, leaching point is 2.08, pure water permeation flux 97.19 L/m(2)h, porosity is 13.97 nm, BSA rejection value is 91 % and Urea clearance is 92 %. These results show that M-3 is excellent for dialysis operations.

Racial Diversity Exposure and Firm Responses Following the Murder of George Floyd	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article						racial diversity; textual analysis; valuation effects; board of directors; corporate actions	CORPORATE-DIRECTORS	George Floyd's murder caused many firms to reveal how exposed they are to racial diversity issues. We examine investor and firm behaviors after this socially significant event to provide evidence on the valuation effects of the exposure and ensuing corporate responses. We develop a text-based measure of a firm's exposure to racial diversity issues from conference call transcripts and find that, after the murder of George Floyd, firms with diversity exposure experience a stock price decrease of approximately 0.7% around the date of the conference call. We provide evidence that this effect is attributable to race-related exposure and not gender-related exposure. Initiatives taken by firms mitigate the negative market reaction. We document that firms with racial diversity exposure respond by appointing Black directors. The stock market views appointments of Black directors more favorably after George Floyd's murder, except when they are perceived as symbolic. We also find that firms with greater exposure to racial diversity are more likely to establish diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) departments, appoint DEI leaders, specify diversity goals, increase supply chain diversity, and donate to racial justice causes.

Synergistic Effect of ZnO and Acid-Functionalised Carbon Nanotubes on Improving the Specific Capacitance of Poly(<i>ortho</i>-Phenylenediamine-co-Aniline)-Based Wearable Electronics	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						biocompatible; carbon nanotubes; polymer nanocomposite; smart fabric; synergistic effect; wearable electronics	ZINC-OXIDE NANOCOMPOSITES; FACILE SYNTHESIS; HIGH-ENERGY; SUPERCAPACITOR; POLYANILINE; PERFORMANCE; NANOFIBERS; NANOWIRES; TEXTILES; POLYMER	The fabrication of highly conducting composites which can be seamlessly integrated into fabric substrates is exceedingly imperative for the development of versatile wearable electronics with long cycling stability and high specific capacitance. Previously, our group has reported the synthesis of poly(ortho-phenylenediamine-co-aniline) using microwave irradiation and we have evaluated the electrochemical properties of both the copolymer and its nanocomposite with acid functionalized carbon nanotubes as wearable electronics. Herein, we design a nanocomposite of zinc oxide decorated acid functionalized carbon nanotubes and the aforementioned copolymer with the aim to evaluate the simultaneous effects of pseudocapacitance and electrical double layer capacitance in the copolymer matrix. The samples were comprehensively characterized using various techniques. These materials were coated on fabric substrates to evaluate their applicability as wearable electronics. A high specific capacitance of 225.95 F g(-1) at 0.50 A g(-1) was obtained and 88 % of the initial capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies for the nanocomposite showed lower cytotoxicity between the concentration ranges of 50-200 mu g/mL. Combination of biocompatibility and enhanced electrochemical performance establishes the unprecedented application of these devices in the field of biocompatible wearable electronics.

Theories on the subject have evolved rapidly in recent years and have led to a more contextualized and dynamic conceptualization of emotion regulation processes. In this paper, based on the distinction between emotion regulation strategies and abilities, we propose future directions for research on emotion regulation development in adolescence. We first present evidence that emotional, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence are central in emotion regulation development. We then review empirical findings on emotion regulation development by tying them to their conceptual foundations. We discuss their limitations and argue that building better conceptual clarity is essential to study emotion regulation. Because current knowledge on recent concepts that emerged in adult-based models remains limited and contested in adolescence, we end this article by discussing new research perspectives to provide a better understanding of the topic. We stress the need for researchers in the field to adopt a more contextualized and person-oriented approach, to combine different time scales and methods, and examine the predictors of emotion regulation as well as its outcomes.

Via a case study analysis of the Syria-Turkey Friendship Dam project proposed for the Asi/Orontes river, we trace the process of cooperation that led to the use of this notion of "friendship" in transboundary cooperation. Using a transversal analysis of different phases of cooperation and non-cooperation, we consider broad, big-picture political and diplomatic factors related to water and beyond. Our analysis shows that two key variables shaped how water was used as an instrument of cooperation in this case: (1) security and (2) the dynamics of international cooperation undertaken by the riparians, namely Turkey. The friendship dam label can be considered a manifestation of strategic international friendship that the two riparian countries invoked to achieve security and bilateral cooperation.

Herein, a series of novel self-assembled CoMn bimetallic catalysts with hollow microcage structure have been prepared through zeolitic imidazole framework (ZIF-67) assisted method followed by direct pyrolysis in static air. Both the Mn loading and the unique hollow microcage structure play important roles in CO low-temperature oxidation, and the highest catalytic activity is obtained for CoMn-2 catalyst, which presents T-100 (temperature of 100 % CO conversion) at 80 degrees C. Through a systematic series of experiments, we further demonstrate that our catalysts' superior catalytic performance arises from small particle size, high surface active oxygen content and Co3+/(Co2++Co3+) ratio. Such configuration of catalysts will pave the way for new strategies to design noble-free high-performance catalysts for CO low-temperature oxidation.

In this work, a facile interface engineering strategy to control the surface structure and energy-level alignment of perovskite films by tailoring the interface between the FAPbI(3) film and hole-transporting layer using 4-hydroxypicolinic acid (4HPA) is reported. According to density functional theory studies, 4HPA has prominent electron delocalization distribution properties that enable it to anchor to the perovskite film surface and facilitate charge transfer at the interface. By enabling multiple bonding interactions with the perovskite layer, including hydrogen bonds, Pb-O, and Pb-N dative bonds, 4HPA passivation significantly reduces the trap density and efficiently suppresses nonradiative recombination. The obtained perovskite films exhibit superior optoelectronic properties with improved crystallinity, pure alpha-phase FAPbI(3), and favorable energy band bending. Following this strategy, 4HPA post-treatment PeSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.28% in 0.12 cm(2) cells and 19.26% in 36 cm(2) modules with excellent environmental and thermal stabilities.

Combining taxonomic and functional approaches to assess land-use impacts on macroinvertebrate assemblages and improve bioindication	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						biomonitoring; biotic indexes; functional diversity; lowland streams	SPECIES TRAITS; WATER-QUALITY; BIOLOGICAL TRAITS; INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; DIFFERENT RESPONSES; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; STREAMS	Most studies exploring land use impacts have focused on taxonomic metrics, but interest in the functional approach has increased because it helps to understand the relationships between community structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. We evaluated how functional and taxonomic approaches, and the association between them, contribute to assessing the effects of land use on macroinvertebrate assemblages of lowland streams. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates in 17 sites with different land uses (agricultural, peri-urban, and extensive livestock) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We computed the taxonomic metrics and biotic indexes as well as functional richness (FRic), divergence (FDiv), dispersion (FDis), and Rao diversity indexes for each site. We performed general linear mixed models to compare land-uses, a redundancy analysis, and also performed correlation analysis between taxonomic and functional indexes. Taxonomic richness was significantly higher in extensive livestock than in the other two land uses, while Shannon diversity was significantly different between land uses (extensive livestock > peri-urban > agriculture). FRic and FDiv were significantly lower in peri-urban land use than in agricultural and extensive livestock sites. Only taxonomic richness showed a significant and positive relationship with FRic, FDis, and Rao, but they fit better to a logarithmic function. Therefore, an increase in taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity did not necessarily imply an increase in the functional aspects of the macroinvertebrate assemblage. Using only one of these approaches could lead to partial evaluations and loss of information. Combining them could improve bioindication and predictive potential and help assess the effects of multiple stressors on freshwater ecosystems to improve biomonitoring.	[Paz, L.

Understanding different viral mechanisms and biochemical pathways is crucial for finding promising therapeutic solutions to viral infections. The mitochondrion is a vital organelle targeted by various types of viruses. More specifically, viruses interact with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a porin protein found in the outer mitochondrial membrane. VDAC controls metabolite flux, regulates reactive oxygen species production, and promotes mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by releasing pro-apoptotic proteins. Hence, a common pathogenic strategy used by many viruses seems to exploit natural pathways that VDAC regulates. This review aims to address the inhibition and enhancement roles of VDAC in viral pathogenesis and outlines multiple links and interactions between VDAC and viral proteins as potential antiviral targets.

To effectively test rejuvenation in vivo, mouse models are the safest alternative. However, we have found that the recent epigenetic clocks developed for mouse reduced-representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) data have significantly poor performance when applied to external datasets. We show that the sites captured and the coverage of key CpGs required for age prediction vary greatly between datasets, which likely contributes to the lack of transferability in RRBS clocks. To mitigate these coverage issues in RRBS-based age prediction, we present two novel design strategies that use average methylation over large regions rather than individual CpGs, whereby regions are defined by sliding windows (e.g. 5 kb), or density-based clustering of CpGs. We observe improved correlation and error in our regional blood clocks (RegBCs) compared to published individual-CpG-based techniques when applied to external datasets. The RegBCs are also more robust when applied to low coverage data and detect a negative age acceleration in mice undergoing calorie restriction. Our RegBCs offer a proof of principle that age prediction of RRBS datasets can be improved by accounting for multiple CpGs over a region, which negates the lack of read depth currently hindering individual-CpG-based approaches.

Prioritize grassland restoration to bend the curve of biodiversity loss	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						biodiversity crisis; ecosystem resilience; extinction risk; forest bias; natural climate solutions; restoration policy	PLANT DIVERSITY; CLIMATE; VEGETATION; PATTERNS; ANCIENT	In times of unprecedented climate change, ecological restoration efforts have a strong focus on forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Grasslands, in contrast, remain relatively neglected in global restoration policies. Concurrently, we are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis-it is estimated that 1 million species are globally threatened with extinction. Here, we present analyses from central Europe and southern Brazil that show that the majority of our endangered plant species are in fact found in open ecosystems. Using Germany as an example, we show that we could reduce plant extinction risk by up to 82% if we restore open, grassy ecosystems. This also holds true for southern Brazil, where grassland species constitute the single largest share of endangered species, but where grassy ecosystems continue to be systematically neglected by restoration policies. We further expand on our biodiversity argument to include the role that grassland restoration can play in mitigating climate change. We posit that ramping up grassland restoration efforts may not only be our best bet to bend the curve of biodiversity loss, but it will also make a critical contribution to the resilience of ecosystems in the dynamic decades to come. It is time for grassland restoration to receive higher priority in global restoration efforts and policy.

We aim to investigate the association between TLS and mAbs and describe clinical features. We conducted a disproportionality analysis to investigate the link between mAbs and TLS by excluding known confounders and compared with other anticancer drugs. The association between mAbs and TLS was evaluated using information component (IC). Drug-drug interaction signals were calculated based on the O shrinkage measure. Parametric distribution with the goodness-of-fit test was used for the reported time-to-onset analysis. From 2016 Q1, to 2022 Q4, a total of 274 TLS with mAbs were reported in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. There were 27% of patients with TLS with mAbs who died and 20.1% occurred a life-threatening situation. Daratumumab, elotuzumab, and belantamab mafodotin presented a robust disproportionate signal of TLS after excluding known confounders (IC025 > 0). Daratumumab had the highest disproportionate signal of TLS among all anticancer drugs for MM. Reported time-to-onset analysis showed the median days for TLS with daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab, and belantamab mafodotin were 1.5, 14.5, 5.5, and 5.5 days, respectively. The drug-drug interaction analysis showed the co-administration of drugs known to increase urate, induce hyperkalemia, or hypocalcemia elevated the reporting frequency for TLS with mAbs (O-025 > 0). Our postmarketing pharmacovigilance analysis detected the reporting association of TLS and mAbs in patients with MM. Additional studies with robust epidemiological study designs that can validate these findings are warranted.

GISTs have malignant potential, whereas leiomyomas and schwannomas are considered benign. PurposeThis study aimed to establish a combined radiomic model based on EUS images for distinguishing GISTs from leiomyomas and schwannomas in the stomach. MethodsEUS images of pathologically confirmed GISTs, leiomyomas, and schwannomas were collected from five centers. Gastric SELs were divided into training and testing datasets based on random split-sample method (7:3). Radiomic features were extracted from the tumor and muscularis propria regions. Principal component analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator were used for feature selection. Support vector machine was used to construct radiomic models. Two radiomic models were built: the conventional radiomic model included tumor features alone, whereas the combined radiomic model incorporated features from the tumor and muscularis propria regions. ResultsA total of 3933 EUS images from 485 cases were included. For the differential diagnosis of GISTs from leiomyomas and schwannomas, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 74.5%, 72.2%, 78.7%, and 0.754, respectively, for the EUS experts; 76.8%, 74.4%, 81.0%, and 0.830, respectively, for the conventional radiomic model; and 90.9%, 91.0%, 90.6%, and 0.953, respectively, for the combined radiomic model. For gastric SELs <20 mm, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the combined radiomic model were 91.4%, 91.6%, 91.1%, and 0.960, respectively. ConclusionsWe developed and validated a combined radiomic model to distinguish gastric GISTs from leiomyomas and schwannomas. The combined radiomic model showed better diagnostic performance than the conventional radiomic model and could assist EUS experts in non-invasively diagnosing gastric SELs, particularly gastric SELs <20 mm.

J	Allen, K; Anderson, L; King, M; Mullan, S				Allen, Kate; Anderson, Lynley; King, Mike; Mullan, Siobhan			Competing interests at the heart of equine sports medicine ethics: A scoping review and thematic analysis	EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Review; Early Access						ethics; horse; sports medicine; veterinary	WELFARE; ABUSE	BackgroundThe ethics of using horses in sport is receiving increasing attention and media scrutiny. Sports medicine ethics is an important and well-established discipline within human medicine and biomedical ethics, which has, thus far, received little application to the equine veterinary field. ObjectivesThe purpose of this scoping review was to explore the existing literature on equine sports medicine ethics, to understand the current concerns and issues, and to map areas for future research. Study designScoping review. MethodsAcademic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CAB abstracts) were searched to identify papers, published in English, between 2000 and 2022, that mentioned aspect(s) of the ethics of veterinary provision to the performance horse. Additionally, grey (including lay) literature was identified through global search engines to locate supplementary and opinion articles. Relevant data on article characteristics and ethical concerns were extracted and charted. Thematic analysis was employed to identify key issues. ResultsA literature source of 41 papers/articles was used; of which 35 were from veterinary sources, mostly veterinary journals and conference proceedings. Several themes were identified including: competing stakeholder interests; governing bodies, rules and regulations; provision of optimal veterinary care; confidentiality; and social licence for the veterinary profession. The most commonly mentioned specific ethical concern was the use of medication in performance horses. Main limitationsIn this scoping review, we have not sought to critically analyse the ethical arguments within the included literature, but rather to collate them so that an overview of ethical concerns can be established. ConclusionsFurther consideration is required as to how the veterinary profession and sporting governing bodies can support individual veterinary surgeons to strive for the highest levels of professional conduct in equine sports medicine. The veterinary profession should continue to work towards establishing processes for determining what veterinary practices are ethical, optimal, excessive, permissible and impermissible.

W.; Banton, Dwaine			Stability analysis using mixed models: A critique of tolerance interval methods and a probabilistic solution	PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian; degradation; pharmaceutical; shelf life; tolerance interval	LIMITS; CONFIDENCE	Recently, tolerance interval approaches to the calculation of a shelf life of a drug product have been proposed in the literature. These address the belief that shelf life should be related to control of a certain proportion of batches being out of specification. We question the appropriateness of the tolerance interval approach. Our concerns relate to the computational challenges and practical interpretations of the method. We provide an alternative Bayesian approach, which directly controls the desired proportion of batches falling out of specification assuming a controlled manufacturing process. The approach has an intuitive interpretation and posterior distributions are straightforward to compute. If prior information on the fixed and random parameters is available, a Bayesian approach can provide additional benefits both to the company and the consumer. It also avoids many of the computational challenges with the tolerance interval methodology.

However, most vitrimers suffer from the conflict between mechanical performance and dynamic reactivity, hindering the development of industrial applications. Herein, a facile but universal material design strategy is proposed to yield tough epoxy vitrimers while preserving excellent reprocessability. Copolymerization and bond exchange reactions can build covalent bridges between heterogeneous polymer networks, thus leading to a hybrid dynamic covalent polymer network containing hard and soft segments. Tailorable mechanical and thermal properties are obtained by controlling the ratio of hard-to-soft components. The resulting epoxy vitrimer can balance strength and stretchability while exhibiting brittle-to-ductile transformation in tensile tests. Enhanced fracture toughness is achieved compared to both pristine hard and soft vitrimers. The resulting vitrimers exhibit excellent processability and potential applications in composite fabrication, welding and reshaping, and multiple shape memory functions. This work presents a feasible approach to satisfying the demands of mechanical performance and dynamic reactivity in the design of epoxy vitrimers. The material design principle will be applicable to a wide range of vitrimer systems to pursue desirable properties.

Methods: 37 expert VR surgeons from 21 mainly European countries participated in Delphi method-based questionnaire for diagnosis and treatment of FTMHs and LMHs. Results: A total of 36 items were rated in round 1 by 37 participants, of which 10 items achieved consensus: intraoperative verification of PVD; clinical superiority of OCT-based FTMH classification; practical ineffectiveness of ocriplasmin; circular 360 degrees ILM peeling for small macular holes; use of regular surgical technique for the size of the hole in concomitant retinal detachment; performing complete vitrectomy; SF6 gas as preferred tamponade; cataract surgery if crystalline lens is mildly/moderately opaque; removal of both ILM and LHEP in LMH surgery. In round 2, 18 items with moderate consensus (45-70% agreement) in round 1 were rated by 35 participants. Final consensus was reached in 35% of questions related to both diagnosis and surgical procedures. Conclusions: This Delphi study provides valuable information about the consensus/disagreement on different scenarios encountered during FTMH and LMH management as a guide tosurgical decision-making. High rate of disagreement and/or variable approaches still exist for treating such relatively common conditions.

Twenty studies (5 on relationship self-regulation, 15 on partner regulation; N = 15,563) were included. A moderate positive association was found between relationship self-regulation and relationship quality (r = .42). A weak positive association was found between positive partner regulation and relationship quality (r = .14). A negative association was found between negative partner regulation strategies and relationship quality (r = -.22). Partner regulation strategies were unlikely to be successful in prompting change in targeted partners. A weak positive association was found between positive strategies and regulation success (r = .10), and a weak negative association was found between negative strategies and regulation success (r = -.09). Thus, relationship self-regulation is more strongly associated with relationship quality than partner regulation.

Trends in regolith thickness in a headwater catchment, Sierra Nevada, California	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							SPATIAL PREDICTION; SOIL; BEDROCK; TERRAIN; FOREST; TOPOGRAPHY; EROSION; TIME	Rooting in deep regolith enables forests to withstand seasonal and annual precipitation shortfalls. Despite its ecological importance, spatial patterns in regolith thickness within forest ecosystems are scarcely documented. Regolith thickness was estimated at 66 sites throughout a 543-ha watershed in the southern Sierra Nevada by hand auger to point of failure or a maximum depth of 7.5 m, describing a minimum thickness estimate. Regolith consists of 1-2 m of soil overlying thick and porous weathered granodiorite. Depth to auger failure ranged from 1.52 to an indeterminate depth beyond 7.5 m. A total of 27 points exceeded 7.5 m depth. Normal, lognormal, and gamma data distribution models were fitted to observations to extrapolate thickness across the watershed and estimate thicknesses beyond the measurement limitation. Predictions for the 95th percentile of regolith thickness varied substantially; 26.05 m for lognormal, 16.87 m for gamma, and 9.56 m for normal. Considering any best fit model, >55% of the watershed area was deeper than 5 m. Depth classes were formed to evaluate the extent to which topography is associated with spatial trends in regolith thickness. Spatial patterns were related to two covariate proxies (distance from stream channel and topographic wetness) with the general landscape trend of shallow depth classes (<3.3 m) in lowlands and deeper regolith classes (>7.5 m) in uplands. The normalized difference vegetation index signatures over the late stages of a 5-year drought were greener in the lowlands. In contrast, upland forests displayed widespread tree die-off, suggesting deep water storage does not maintain forests over long-term drought.	[Ferrell, Ryan M.; Devine, Scott; O'Geen, Anthony T.

This study aims to retrospectively investigate the toxicity and efficacy of Carbon-ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) on HCC with CP-B patients.Materials and Methods Patients with CP-B, no extrahepatic metastasis, and treated with C-ion RT between May 2000 and March 2020 were retrospectively extracted and included in this study.Results Sixty-nine lesions of 58 patients were included. The median follow-up duration was 20.5 (2.7-108) months. During follow-up, recurrence was observed in 43 patients, including 2 local recurrences and 39 intrahepatic recurrences beyond the irradiation field. A grade 3 acute hepatotoxicity was observed in one patient during the observation period. No acute or late adverse event of grade = 4 was observed. Overall survival was 80.4% and 46.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, and the median survival time was 22.6 months. Local control rate was 96.4% at both 1 and 2 years, and progression-free survival was 38.6% and 6.9% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, with a median of 9.7 months.Conclusion The C-ion RT showed low toxicity and good local effect in patients with HCC and CP-B. Therefore, C-ion RT could be an appropriate treatment for patients with HCC with poor liver function.

In this work, carbon nanotube (CNT)-Mn3O4/CoWO4 triple-segment hybrid electrode is synthesized by using a two-step microwave-assisted hydrothermal route. Systematic physical characterization revealed that, with the assistance of microwave, granular Mn3O4 and spheroid-like CoWO4 with preferred orientation, and oxygen vacancies are stacked or arranged on CNTs skeletons to construct a rational designed hybrid nanocomposite with abundant heterointerfaces and interfacial chemical bonds. Electrochemical evaluations show that the synergistic cooperation in CNT-Mn3O4/CoWO4 resulted in an ultra-high specific capacity (1907.5 C g(-1)/529.8 mA h g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)), a wide operating voltage window (1.15 V), the satisfactory rate capability (capacity maintained at 1016.5 C g(-1)/282.3 mA h g(-1) at 15 A g(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (117.2% initial capacity retention after 13000 cycles at 15 A g(-1)). In addition, the assembled CNT-Mn3O4/CoWO4//N doped porous carbon (N-C) BSH device delivered a stable working voltage of 2.05 V and superior energy density of 67.5 Wh kg(-1) at power density of 1025 W kg(-1), as well as excellent stability (92.2% capacity retained at 5 A g(-1) for 12600 cycles). This work provides a new and feasible tactic to develop high-performance transition metal oxide-based cathodes for advanced BSH devices.

Core Hospitals and Designated Hospitals host molecular tumor boards, which is more time-consuming than simply participating in them. We sent a questionnaire to government-designated Cancer Genomic Medicine Hospitals, including all 12 Core Hospitals, all 33 Designated Hospitals, and 117 of 188 Cooperative Hospitals. The questionnaire asked how much time physicians and nonphysicians spent on administrative work for cancer genomic medicine. For every CGP test, 7.6 h of administrative work was needed. Physicians spent 2.7 h/patient, while nonphysicians spent 4.9 h/patient. Time spent preparing for molecular tumor boards, called Expert Panels, was the longest, followed by time spent participating in Expert Panels. Assuming an hourly wage of yen 24,000/h for physicians and yen 2800/h for nonphysicians, mean labor cost was yen 78,071/patient. On a monthly basis, more time was spent on administrative work at Core Hospitals compared with Designated Hospitals and Cooperative Hospitals (385 vs. 166 vs. 51 h/month, respectively, p < 0.001). Consequently, labor cost per month was higher at Core Hospitals than at Designated Hospitals and Cooperative Hospitals ( yen 3,951,854 vs. yen 1,687,167 vs. yen 487,279/month, respectively, p < 0.001). Completing a CGP test for a cancer patient in Japan is associated with significant labor at each hospital, especially at Core Hospitals. Streamlining the exchange of information and simplifying Expert Panels will likely alleviate this burden.

Both MIL-101(Cr/Fe) and MP8@MIL-101(Cr/Fe) were characterized by PXRD, FTIR spectroscopy and TGA. The catalytic activity of MP8@MIL-101(Cr/Fe) for the oxidation of styrene by H2O2 and tBuOOH was then examined under various reaction conditions (nature of the co-solvent and of the oxidant, concentration of the oxidant and of the substrate, time, pH) and compared to that of MP8 alone. Under the best conditions used, MP8@MIL-101(Cr/Fe) was then shown to catalyze the oxidation of styrene about 3 times more efficiently than MP8 alone with approximately 50 % selectivity for styrene oxide.

There has been a recent upsurge of radical decarboxylative transformations. The process can be initiated under mild conditions, and the resultant radicals have orthogonal reactivities to closed-shell species, thus providing immense opportunities for streamlining novel reactions. The use of free carboxylic acids is the most desirable owing to its high atom and step economy. Aiming to demonstrate the attractiveness of the strategy and to inspire chemists to tackle existing challenges, this review outlines the recent advances on radical decarboxylative functionalization of free carboxylic acids.

Phytochemical study on the methanol extract of the aerial parts of this plant led to the isolation of seven phenolic compounds, (2R,3R,4R)-3,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavan 5-O-[beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1 -> 6)]-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), quercitrin (2), isoquercitrin (3), kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L- arabinopyranoside (4), kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (5), kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (6), and 6-O-vanilloylarbutin (7). Among these isolates, compound 1 was previously undescribed compounds. Their chemical structures and the absolute configurations of the new compound were elucidated by 1D-, 2D NMR, HR-ESI-MS and ECD spectroscopic techniques. The known compounds were identified by comparison their NMR spectral data with those reported in the literature.

Percutaneous decannulation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation using the Manta vascular closure device: A systematic review and meta-analysis	ARTIFICIAL ORGANS			English	Review; Early Access						decannulation; ECMO; meta-analysis; percutaneous; systematic review	LEARNING-CURVE; CANNULATION; REMOVAL	ObjectivesTo perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the techniques and outcomes associated with percutaneous decannulation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) using the Manta vascular closure device. BackgroundPeripheral VA-ECMO can be used to treat critically ill patients with conditions such as refractory cardiogenic shock. After percutaneous implantation of VA-ECMO, VA-ECMO can also be decannulated completely percutaneously by using a vascular closure device. The Manta vascular closure device is a dedicated device used in the closure of large-bore arteriotomies by sandwiching the arteriotomy with an intra-arterial toggle and an extraluminal collagen plug. MethodsWe performed a thorough literature search using various electronic databases. We included studies that reported outcomes after peripheral femorofemoral VA-ECMO decannulation with the Manta vascular closure device. We performed a meta-analysis of proportions on outcome measures, including technical success, bleeding complications, vascular complications, wound complications, major amputation, and procedural-related deaths. ResultsWe included seven studies with a total of 116 patients. The overall technical success of percutaneous decannulation of VA-ECMO with the Manta vascular closure device was 93.7%. The overall incidence of bleeding, vascular and wound complications was 1.7%, 13.8%, and 3.4%, respectively. No patient required lower limb amputation or died due to VA-ECMO decannulation. ConclusionPercutaneous decannulation with the Manta vascular closure device is an effective and safe procedure that should be considered in suitable patients on VA-ECMO.	[Ng, Jun Jie; Lim, Joseph K.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of ERC plantings on carbon (C) sequestration and selected soil quality parameters in existing plantings across the northern U.S. Great Plains. Nine locations were selected in five states with mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 446 to 999 mm and mean annual temperature (MAT) from 4.4 to 10.0 degrees C. Infiltration was measured using the twin ring technique at nine sites in each tree planting and adjacent field (crop, pasture, or hay) at each location. Following infiltration measurements, a 4.8 cm-diameter soil core to 30 cm depth was collected from inside one infiltration ring of each pair for bulk density, pH, aggregate stability, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) analyses. Penetration resistance in 2.5 cm increments to 30 cm depth was measured in the other infiltration ring. SOC stocks under ERC were significantly higher than in the adjacent field soil at five of the locations and, for all locations, averaged 16.8% greater than in the adjacent field. The estimated SOC accumulation rate for the eight locations with uniform tree stand age averaged 0.30 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Most locations had higher TN and C/N and lower bulk density beneath ERC. Fewer differences for infiltration and penetration resistance and smaller and less consistent differences for pH and aggregate stability were observed. Tree aboveground C stocks were estimated to increase an average of 2.05 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Estimated tree aboveground biomass C and SOC stocks under ERC and in adjacent fields were strongly correlated with MAP. Potential ERC planting for C sequestration or bioenergy feedstock production is not likely to significantly degrade soil quality and may improve soil physical or chemical quality for locations in the US Great Plains.

We aimed to examine the clinical, electrophysiological, and prognostic features of POLE, which is a rare and under-investigated syndrome. Methods: Archives from two tertiary epilepsy centers were retrospectively scanned and patients with normal neurological examination and cranial imaging were identified with POLE if they had: (1) seizures consistently triggered by photic stimuli; (2) non-motor seizures with visual symptoms; and (3) photosensitivity documented on EEG. The clinical and electrophysiological features and prognostic factors were evaluated for patients who had follow-up >= 5 years. Results: We identified 29 patients diagnosed with POLE with a mean age of 20.1 +/- 7.6 years. In one-third of the patients, POLE syndrome overlapped with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE). The overlap group had higher rates of febrile seizure history and self-induction; when compared to pure POLE patients, their EEGs showed more frequent interictal generalized epileptic discharges and posterior multiple spikes during intermittent photic stimulation. During long-term follow-up, the remission rate for POLE was 80%, but EEG photosensitivity persisted in three quarters of patients despite clinical remission, and more than half had relapsed after clinical remission. Significance: This first long-term follow-up study, utilizing newly suggested criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy, showed that POLE syndrome shows a notable overlap with GGE but also has distinctive features. POLE has a good prognosis; however, relapses are common, and photosensitivity persists as an EEG finding in the majority of patients.

In this study, the sintering resistance and thermophysical and mechanical properties of conventional and novel-structured TBCs were systematically characterized. The results suggested that the thermal conductivity and sintering shrinkage of the novel-structured TBCs were approximately 30% lower than those of conventional air plasma spraying TBCs. The elastic modulus of the novel-structured coating is only 32% of that of the conventional structure after thermal exposure at 1300 degrees C for 100 h. The distinct structure of the coating is the main factor that influences its performance. The relationship between the structural evolution and residual strain of the coating was analyzed using electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Significant differences were observed in the sintering behavior of the dense matrix and embedded particle regions in the coating. Some columnar grains near the intersplat pores in the dense matrix have similar lattice orientations, and they tend to connect and consequently heal the intersplat pores. The large pores between the agglomerated particles and non-oriented submicron-sized grains that constitute these particles are responsible for the sintering resistance of the coating.

However, the anisotropy of mechanical properties of WAAM components cannot be avoided, which makes the mechanical properties of WAAM components unstable and seriously limits its engineering application. Herein, the tensile samples for 304 stainless-steel thin-walled structures along three directions (longitudinal, diagonal, and transverse) of the deposition layer are intercepted. The mechanical properties of the components are 9.3-54.6% higher than the standard values. The samples have obvious anisotropy characteristics. Samples with diagonal direction show the best mechanical properties, which are not affected by process parameters. The better the forming quality, the higher the mechanical properties of the samples. By correlating the mechanical properties results of the samples with the microstructures, it is found that very fine dendrites grow along the deposition direction in the samples, and this unique microstructure leads to the anisotropy of the mechanical properties. Under the action of uniaxial tensile load, the growth direction of precise dendrite in the sample with diagonal direction is almost the same as the slip direction of the maximum dislocation plane, which is the reason for the excellent mechanical properties of the sample with diagonal direction.

Intrinsic morphology and spatial distribution of non-structural carbohydrates contribute to drought resistance of two mulberry cultivars	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						drought stress; gas exchange; Morus; root-shoot ratio; soluble sugars; starch	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; PROLINE ACCUMULATION; ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES; CARBON METABOLISM; STOMATAL DENSITY; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; GENE-EXPRESSION; TOLERANCE; STARCH; STRESS	Drought is one of the most adverse environmental stresses limiting plant growth and productivity. However, the underlying mechanisms regarding metabolism of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in source and sink organs are still not fully elucidated in woody trees.Saplings of mulberry cv Zhongshen1 and Wubu were subjected to a 15-day progressive drought stress. NSC levels and gene expression involved in NSC metabolism were investigated in roots and leaves. Growth performance and photosynthesis, leaf stomatal morphology, and other physiological parameters were also analysed.Under well-watered conditions, Wubu had a higher R/S, with higher NSC in leaves than in roots; Zhongshen1 had a lower R/S with higher NSC in roots than leaves. Under drought stress, Zhongshen1 showed decreased productivity and increased proline, abscisic acid, ROS content and activity of antioxidant enzymes, while Wubu sustained comparable productivity and photosynthesis. Interestingly, drought resulted in decreased starch and slightly increased soluble sugars in leaves of Wubu, accompanied by notable downregulation of starch-synthesizing genes and upregulation of starch-degrading genes. Similar patterns in NSC levels and relevant gene expression were also observed in roots of Zhongshen1. Concurrently, soluble sugars decreased and starch was unchanged in roots of Wubu and leaves of Zhongshen1. However, gene expression of starch metabolism in roots of Wubu was unaltered, but in leaves of Zhongshen1 starch metabolism was more activated.These findings revealed that intrinsic R/S and spatial distribution of NSC in roots and leaves concomitantly contribute to drought resistance in mulberry.

A comprehensive literature investigation till February 2023 was applied and 978 interrelated investigations were reviewed. The 10 chosen investigations enclosed 2173 individuals with HT were in the chosen investigations' starting point, 1164 of them were utilising MTRIs, and 1009 were utilising control. Odds ratio (OR) in addition to 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilised to compute the value of the WCs frequency in HT recipients on MTRIs by the dichotomous approaches and a fixed or random model. MTRIs had significantly higher WCs (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.19-1.98, P = .001) compared with those with control in individuals with HT. MTRIs had significantly higher WCs compared with those with control in individuals with HT. However, care must be exercised when dealing with its values because of the low number of the nominated investigations and the low sample size of some of the nominated investigations for the meta-analysis.

However, there are limited data to support this assertion. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed the records of 8204 patients who were prescribed AAM for AF and had transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at the multicenter, VA Midwest Health Care Network from 2000 to 2021. We excluded patients without LVH (septal or posterior wall dimension <= 1.4 cm). The primary outcome variable was all-cause mortality during antiarrhythmic therapy or within 6 months after stopping it. Propensity-stratified analyses were performed between amiodarone versus non-amiodarone (Vaughan-Williams Class I and III) AAM. ResultsA total of 1277 patients with LVH (mean age 70.2 +/- 9.5 years) were included in the analysis. Of these, 774 (60.6%) were prescribed amiodarone. Baseline characteristics of the two comparison groups were similar after propensity adjustment. After a median 1.40 years of follow-up, 203 (15.9%) patients died. Incidence rates per 100 patient-year follow-up was 9.02 (7.58-10.66) for amiodarone and 4.98 (3.91-62.56) for non-amiodarone. In propensity-stratified analysis, amiodarone use was associated with 1.58 times higher risk of mortality (95% CI 1.03-2.44; p = .038). Sub-group analysis in 336 (26.3%) patients with severe LVH showed no difference in mortality (HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.82-2.43, p = .21). ConclusionAmong patients with AF and LVH, amiodarone was associated with a significantly higher mortality risk than other AAM.

The shift to a strengths-based approach in the field of autism necessitates increased understanding of these skills. AimsThis study examined (1) rates of exceptional skills in autistic school-age children as reported by parents and teachers, (2) associations between exceptional skills, autism severity and intellectual disability and (3) correlations between parent and teacher reports of exceptional skills. MethodParents and teachers of 76 children attending autism-specific schools in Australia completed online questionnaires. Thereafter, 35 parents and teachers who identified their child as having one or more exceptional skills were interviewed by a clinical psychologist. ResultsForty parents (53%) and 16 (21%) teachers reported that their child had at least one exceptional skill (agreement between the parent and teacher reports was low; kappa = .03, p = .74). In comparison, clinical psychologist assessments identified 22 children (29%) as having at least one such skill. No statistically significant relationships were identified between exceptional skills, autism severity and intellectual disability. ConclusionWhile different exceptional skills were identified, regardless of children's intellectual functioning or autism severity, parents and teachers varied substantially in their evaluations of these skills. Furthermore, the identified prevalence rates of exceptional skills did not always align with the rates identified in previous studies. The study findings highlight the need for definitional consensus on different types of exceptional skills, and the importance of multiple criteria/multi-instrument approaches in the identification of exceptional skills in autistic children.

J	Grover, S; McDonough, R; Smaellie, K				Grover, Simran; McDonough, Robert; Smaellie, Kendrick			Dental students' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about marijuana and its effects on patients' oral health	JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						attitudes; cannabis; dental education; oral health; students	DEPENDENCE EDUCATION; SUBSTANCE USE; CANNABIS; ADULTS; SCHOOL	Purpose/ObjectivesThis article seeks to determine dental students' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions toward patients' marijuana use and whether dental students would like additional marijuana education. MethodsPredoctoral dental students were invited in 2021 to complete a questionnaire regarding marijuana's oral health effects, their comfort discussing marijuana with patients and their interest in additional training. ResultsAmong participants (n = 206, 32.7% response rate), most were familiar with smoked, smokeless and edible methods, but only 39.3% were familiar with topical applications. Only 29.6% of preclinical and 32.2% of clinical Doctor of Dental Medicine students agreed that smoking marijuana was detrimental to one's health, compared to 64.6% of internationally trained Advanced Standing students. Significantly more clinical students (70.6%) could identify how often they treat patients having used marijuana compared to the estimates of preclinical students (36.7%), although 44.2% of all students indicated they were unsure. Not surprisingly, more preclinical students were uncomfortable treating patients during routine dental procedures (45.6% preclinical vs. 32.8% clinical) and when administering local anesthesia (45.6% preclinical vs. 38.8% clinical) due to not yet providing direct patient care. A majority of both preclinical (92.2%) and clinical (89.7%) students agreed they would benefit from more marijuana education. Clinical students preferred adding a brief introductory seminar while preclinical students preferred multiple lectures throughout the curriculum. ConclusionAs states legalize medical and recreational marijuana use, dental schools need to evaluate marijuana education in their curriculum and develop resources so students can feel comfortable and confident in their ability to identify and safely treat patients who use marijuana.

The structure of the complexes was elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) methods. The experimental photophysical properties of the complexes were investigated and complemented with theoretical calculations. Effective energy transfer (ET) pathways for the sensitized red luminescence is discussed. The complexes were tested as emitting layers (EML) in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). At the optimum doping concentration of 4 wt.%, the double-EML OLEDs of Eu-1 exhibited red electroluminescence (EL) with an EQE of 4.0% and maximum brightness (B) = 1179 cd/m(2), maximum current efficiency (eta(c))= 5.64 cd/A, and maximum power efficiency (eta(p))= 4.78 lm/W at the current density (J) of 10 mA/cm(2). Interestingly, the double-EML OLEDs of Eu-2 at the optimum concentration of 3 wt.%, displayed an outstanding EL performance with EQE of 7.32% and B= 838 cd/m(2),eta(c)= 10.19 cd/A and eta(p)= 10.33 lm/W at J= 10 mA/cm(2). The EL performance of this device is among the best reported for devices incorporating a europium complex as a red emitter.

In the resulting system, the gel buffer was diluted twofold and supplemented with glycine at a low concentration, whereas a higher voltage was applied. This approach reduced runtime from 90 to 18 min. It is important to emphasize that, despite the high voltage applied to the gel, the resolution of the bands did not decrease compared to the original Laemmli method. The proposed acceleration approach can be used in other variants of SDS-PAGE.

Echoes of "dead" colonialism: The voices and materiality of a (post)colonial Algerian newspaper	JOURNAL OF LINGUISTIC ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article							LANGUAGE	Through the concept of the echo, this article examines how postcolonial Algerians discursively locate and orient themselves in relation to the materiality of "dead" colonialism, which I broadly define as the physical presence of objects, voices, and sensual qualities (accompanied by aesthetic, value, and moral judgments) that Algerians see as persisting from the colonial before. I argue that an echo in discourse hinges on a tripartite dialogic structure: the dynamic interplay of past voices/signs, present listeners, and the material surfaces that reflect these voices/signs with delay, distortion, and varied intensity. Through the narratives of three directors of three different iterations of a local newspaper in Oran, Algeria, I examine how past voices and sounds reverberate across the threshold of the colonial and postcolonial divide and create sociopolitical and interpersonal effects that often challenge the notion that colonialism is "dead and gone." This article advances scholarship on language materiality by positing that the material world is more than just the setting in which material speech and social action occur; rather, the material world shapes how language is heard and stances are taken in concrete ways. I conclude that echoes are central to how people tell stories about their past that matter in the present.

Energetic landscape of polycystin channel gating	EMBO REPORTS			English	Article						calcium; polycystic kidney disease; polycystins; structural biology; TRP channels	KIDNEY-DISEASE; PROTEIN-STRUCTURE; IDENTIFICATION; PORE; MOUSE; VOLTAGE; GENE; EXPRESSION; SEQUENCE; RECEPTOR	Members of the polycystin family (PKD2 and PKD2L1) of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels conduct Ca2+ and depolarizing monovalent cations. Variants in PKD2 cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in humans, whereas loss of PKD2L1 expression causes seizure susceptibility in mice. Understanding structural and functional regulation of these channels will provide the basis for interpreting their molecular dysregulation in disease states. However, the complete structures of polycystins are unresolved, as are the conformational changes regulating their conductive states. To provide a holistic understanding of the polycystin gating cycle, we use computational prediction tools to model missing PKD2L1 structural motifs and evaluate more than 150 mutations in an unbiased mutagenic functional screen of the entire pore module. Our results provide an energetic landscape of the polycystin pore, which enumerates gating sensitive sites and interactions required for opening, inactivation, and subsequent desensitization. These findings identify the external pore helices and specific cross-domain interactions as critical structural regulators controlling the polycystin ion channel conductive and nonconductive states.

However, medication non-adherence was previously recognized as a major problem in the treatment of hypertension. The mechanisms behind the positive impacts of lifestyle changes might occur in different ways. In comparison with other studies, the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. However, in this review, the attitudinal lifestyle modifications and barriers to blood pressure control were elaborated on. An effective method for reducing blood pressure (BP) and preventing cardiovascular events with antihypertensive medications has been outlined. Maintaining healthy lifestyle factors (body mass index, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, sodium excretion, and sedentary behavior) could lower systolic blood pressure BP by 3.5 mm Hg and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by about 30%, regardless of genetic susceptibility to hypertension. Conducting a lifestyle intervention using health education could improve lifestyle factors, such as reducing salt, sodium, and fat intake, changing eating habits to include more fruits and vegetables, not smoking, consuming less alcohol, exercising regularly, maintaining healthy body weight, and minimizing stressful conditions. Each behavior could affect BP by modulating visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vascular endothelial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autonomic function. Evidence of the joint effect of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle reforms suggests a pathway to reduce hypertension.

Immunology and virology have been a continuing driving focus in our software development and application within the Molecular Graphics Lab (now the Center for Computational Structural Biology - CCSB), spurred on by the marriage of chemistry with biology that Richard enabled at Scripps. Many of our earliest and continuing computational docking targets have been focused on HIV with collaborations with Chi-Huey Wong and Barry Sharpless. Along with subsequent computational work with Jeff Kelly, Reza Ghadiri, Udi Keinan and Ben Cravatt we have been able to sustain continuous efforts in developing and applying docking and other computational technologies to structural chemistry problems. In this remembrance, we give our reflections of Richard Lerner's character, vision, and his inspiration in our scientific lives and in the environment that he created at Scripps Research.

In order to develop the sustainable and affodable power solution, the bettered power quality (PQ) based modified bridgeless switched inductor (MBSL) Sepic power factor correction (PFC) converter is introduced in this article. An added feature to an already existing traditional Sepic converter resulted in switched inductor (SL) network that reasonably improves the step-down voltage gain with low current stress across the output inductors and diodes which restricts the utilization of transformer that ultimately reduces the overall cost of power solution. This introduced structure acts as a good choice of low-cost power conversion solution in the perspective of improved inline PQ indices, high efficiency and good reliability. Furthermore, the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) functioning of SL network reveals the innate zero current switching (ZCS) capability with enhanced efficiency. Besides, the effective functionality of the one-stage PFC converter is tested on hardware prototype of 250 W/48 V, and it also adopts an appropriate control approach to stabilize the output voltage. This study also exposes small signal modeling to prove the stability of the power solution. In addition, the test outcomes reveal that the preferred PFC procure sinusoidal current from the AC mains that confirms the good enshaping attribute and low current harmonic distortions within the stipulated IEC 61000-3-2 standard guidelines for both standstill and fluctuating conditions.

Firstly, a formation control protocol is designed with local information of neighboring agents, where the total energy consumption during the formation process is constructed and the impacts of interaction constraints are imposed. Then, minimum-energy formation design and analysis criteria of DMASs are presented in terms of the linear matrix inequality tool, which can be checked by the generalized eigenvalue method. Finally, a numerical simulation is shown to verify the effectiveness of the main results.

A gene expression control technology for cell-free systems and synthetic cells via targeted gene silencing and transfection	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING			English	Article						gene regulation; synthetic biology; synthetic cells; transfection	TRANSCRIPTION-TRANSLATION; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; RNA	Synthetic cells, expressing proteins using cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL), is a technology utilized for a variety of applications, such as investigating natural gene pathways, metabolic engineering, drug development or bioinformatics. For all these purposes, the ability to precisely control gene expression is essential. Various strategies to control gene expression in TXTL have been developed; however, further advancements on gene-specific and straightforward regulation methods are still needed. Here, we present a method of control of gene expression in TXTL using a "silencing oligo": a short oligonucleotide, designed with a particular secondary structure, that binds to the target messenger RNA. We demonstrated that silencing oligo inhibits protein expression in TXTL in a sequence-dependent manner. We showed that silencing oligo activity is associated with RNase H activity in bacterial TXTL. To complete the gene expression control toolbox for synthetic cells, we also engineered a first transfection system. We demonstrated the transfection of various payloads, enabling the introduction of RNA and DNA of different lengths to synthetic cell liposomes. Finally, we combined the silencing oligo and the transfection technologies, demonstrating control of gene expression by transfecting silencing oligo into synthetic minimal cells.

This systematic review summarizes behavioral interventions designed to promote sun-protection behaviors and reduce harmful UV exposure among U.S. adolescents. Ten studies describing 15 intervention arms were ultimately included in this review and comprised seven cross-sectional studies, a cohort study, a quasi-experimental study, and a randomized controlled trial. Most interventions included in this review were effective in increasing awareness of skin cancer and knowledge of the risk factors for skin cancer, but knowledge did not correlate with self-reported frequency of sun-protection behaviors in this population.

We collected a total of 3807 fish specimens representing 42 species. Our result indicated that the fish community composition differed between the upper and lower regions of the river. The communities in the upper region is influenced by high-nutrient concentrations, while downstream sites were characterized by high concentrations of suspended solids. Variation partitioning revealed higher contributions of spatial than environmental predictors on fish community composition, with a higher total predicted variance in dry season. The variations in the community composition between upper and lower region may be attributable to the differences in the nature of anthropogenic activities within the regions, which influenced the local conditions differently. Differences in flow dynamics between upper and lower regions as attributable to black and white floods in the LNRB modify the connectivity between sites. Dispersal among sites may be more limited downstream than in the upper region, particularly in the dry season, because damming in the upper region also interrupts the natural flood regime such that there are low water levels in the lower region, which spatially isolate fish communities at certain sampling sites. The relatively higher total predicted variance during dry season may be attributable to the temporal differences in abiotic conditions between sites, which may have influenced site level community composition and abundance differently.

However, the regulatory determinants of domain co-activity remain unclear. Here, we leverage human individual variation in gene expression to characterize the co-regulatory processes underlying domain co-activity and systematically quantify their effect sizes. We employ transcriptional decomposition to extract from RNA expression data an expression component related to co-activity revealed by genomic positioning. This strategy reveals close to 1,500 co-activity domains, covering most expressed genes, of which the large majority are invariable across individuals. Focusing specifically on domains with high variability in co-activity reveals that contained genes have a higher sharing of eQTLs, a higher variability in enhancer interactions, and an enrichment of binding by variably expressed transcription factors, compared to genes within non-variable domains. Through careful quantification of the relative contributions of regulatory processes underlying co-activity, we find transcription factor expression levels to be the main determinant of gene co-activity. Our results indicate that distal trans effects contribute more than local genetic variation to individual variation in co-activity domains.

Measurement/tracking of COVID-19 fear could facilitate remediation. Despite the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S)'s validation in multiple languages/countries, nationwide United States (U.S.) studies are scarce. Cross-sectional classical test theory-based validation studies predominate. Our longitudinal study sampled respondents to a 3-wave, nationwide, online survey. We calibrated the FCV-19S using a unidimensional graded response model. Item/scale monotonicity, discrimination, informativeness, goodness-of-fit, criterion validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were assessed. Items 7, 6, and 3 consistently displayed very high discrimination. Other items had moderate-to-high discrimination. Items 3, 6, and 7 were most (items one-fifth least) informative. Item scalability was 0.62-0.69; full-scale scalability 0.65-0.67. Ordinal reliability coefficient was 0.94; test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient 0.84. Positive correlations with posttraumatic stress/anxiety/depression, and negative correlations with emotional stability/resilience supported convergent/divergent validity. The FCV-19S validly/reliably captures temporal variation in COVID-19 fear across the U.S.	[Waddimba, Anthony C.

Herein, we developed a metal organic framework (MOF)-based fluorescence nanoprobe to analyze the progression of AS by assessing the levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose in blood and tissue. The probe was prepared by post-modification of the MOF with iodine (I-3(-))-rhodamine B (RhB) associate, which realizes the specific recognition of target object through the metal joint Zr-IV and I-3(-)-RhB, respectively. We investigated different stages of target object changes in the early non-plaque stage of AS in blood. It was found that the levels of phosphate and glucose in the blood were higher than those of the normal mice. The results of two-photon images showed that early AS mice had higher levels of protein phosphorylation and glucose than that of the normal mice. The present study provides a suitable fluorescence tool for further revealing the pathogenesis and progression of AS.

In this paper, chitosan (CS)-soy protein isolate (SPI) crosslinked films were prepared using GP as a crosslinking agent. Crosslinking reaction with high contents of GP (0.03%, 0.05%) changed the rheological property of the film matrixes. The crosslinking degree was positively correlated with the content of GP, which was from 21.08 +/- 3.95% of CS-SPI-1 to 39.66 +/- 1.62% of CS-SPI-5. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra confirmed the crosslinking reaction. The X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses indicated that the crosslinking reaction decreased the crystallinity degree and enhanced the surface roughness of CS-SPI film, respectively. The crosslinking reaction did not significantly affect the thickness, moisture content and water solubility of CS-SPI film. Crosslinked films presented better light barrier capacity. The tensile strength (TS) of CS-SPI-1 was increased by 50%, however, further increasing the contents of GP (0.03%, 0.05%) reduced the TS of the crosslinked films. With the increasing incorporation with GP, the EAB was significantly decreased, while the modulus increased from 95.76 +/- 25.78 to 508.78 +/- 77.95 MPa. The crosslinking reaction improved the rigidity of CS-SPI film. Low crosslinking degree could improve thermal stability of CS-SPI, while higher GP addition (0.03%, 0.05%) decreased the thermal stability and prolonged the degradation time of the film in soil. The results indicated that low crosslinking reaction could improve the property of CS-SPI film, enhancing its potential application in food packaging.

MethodsA scoping review was conducted following the methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) identification of the research questions; (2) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search recommended by JBI: an initial search within PubMed and CINAHL, a comprehensive literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and literature search of references lists; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and charting; (5) collation, summarization, and reporting of the results. The PRISMA-ScR Checklist was used to report. ResultsA total of 4602 studies were identified, of which 87 studies were included. Approximately 78% were randomized controlled trials. More than 88% of the participants were men with prostate cancer. Exercising pelvic floor muscles 30 times per day for 12 weeks was the most frequently reported. Parameters of electrical stimulation were typically set up to 50 Hz and 300 mu s for frequency and width of pulse, respectively, and lasted for 15 min. Pure pelvic floor muscle training, Pilates, Yoga, whole body vibration, diaphragm/abdominal muscle training, micturition interruption exercise, acupuncture, and auriculotherapy showed positive effects on reducing urinary incontinence. ConclusionThe findings suggested implementing pelvic floor muscle training alone before or after surgery can both prompt the recovery of continence in men after prostate cancer surgery. The decision to use biofeedback or electrical stimulation to enhance the therapeutic effect of pelvic floor muscle training should be approached with caution. More rigorous designed studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques and diverse novel methods. Relevance to clinical practicePhysicians and nurses need to be up to date on the latest evidence-based non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence and select appropriate interventions based on available medical resources and patient preferences.

Yet little is known about the potentially unique nature of caregiver FCR. Our research aimed to address this gap by qualitatively exploring the features and impact of caregiver FCR. MethodsEighteen semi-structured telephone interviews with cancer caregivers were conducted to explore the content and impact of caregiver fears and worries about cancer recurrence or progression. Data analysis used a Framework Approach. ResultsQualitative analysis identified three themes (1) fear of the patient suffering, (2) the need to protect the patient from a recurrence and/or cancer-related distress, and (3) caregiver's sense of unpreparedness and uncertainty. Underpinning these themes was an overarching sense of personal responsibility for the life of the patient. This overarching theme was identified as a key driver of caregivers' personal and patient-centred fears. ConclusionsOur findings confirm the conceptual differences between patient and caregiver FCR. Future research must therefore acknowledge the unique experiences of caregivers and prioritise the development of empirically driven theoretical models, instruments, and interventions for caregiver FCR.

However, experimental tests of this association, as well as theoretical accounts explaining this relationship, are lacking. The present study aims to compensate for this gap by developing a theoretical framework based on the social identity approach that explains the effect of community-based heritage engagement on well-being, and testing this effect in a quasi-experimental field study in the context of community test pit archeological excavations. In line with the predictions, the results demonstrate that excavation participants (but not participants in the control condition) report improvements on a number of psychological outcomes after (as compared to before) participation in a 2-day excavation program (including well-being, self-efficacy, and perceived community support). The findings offer implications for community-based approaches to enhancing well-being, as well as the practice of conducting community-based archeological excavations.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of non-surgical periodontal therapy on pocket closure (PC), defined as PPD <= 4 mm without BOP (PC1) or PPD <= 4 mm solely (PC2) 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment and to compare PC between smokers and non-smokers.Methods This cohort study is a secondary analysis from a controlled clinical trial consisting of systemically healthy patients with stage III or IV grade C periodontitis. All the sites with baseline PPD >= 5 mm are included as diseased sites and PC at 3 months after completion of non-surgical periodontal treatment was calculated. PC was compared between smokers and non-smokers at site and patient levels. Multilevel analysis is used to investigate factors at patient, tooth and site levels affecting PPD changes and the probability of PC.Results A total of 1998 diseased sites in 27 patients were included in the analysis. The rates of PC1 and PC2 were 58.4% and 70.2% and were significantly correlated to smoking habits at site level (r (1) = 7.03, p = 0.008; r (1) = 36.17, p < 0.001). Tooth type, mobility, clinical attachment level (CAL) and PPD at baseline significantly affected PC.Conclusions The present findings indicate that non-surgical periodontal treatment is effective in PC, but its performance is influenced by baseline PPD and CAL and residual pockets may remain.

Alternatively, earth-abundant M-N-C (M=Fe, Co, or Ni) materials have stood out as potential candidates because of their suitable electrocatalytic properties for the aforementioned reactions. In this way, the present review aims to provide a thorough account of the recently reported strategies to improve the electrocatalytic reduction of O-2, CO2, and water on M-N-C catalysts. In order to have an in-depth understanding of these reactions, we will also discuss some of the latest theoretical studies based on computer modelling and simulation. Lastly, additional comments on future perspectives will be provided to guide new studies.	[de Araujo, Moises A.; Koverga, Andrey A. A.; Sakita, Alan M. P.; Ometto, Felipe B.

Fucosylated Human Milk Oligosaccharides Drive Structure-Specific Syntrophy between <i>Bifidobacterium infantis</i> and <i>Eubacterium hallii</i> within a Modeled Infant Gut Microbiome	MOLECULAR NUTRITION & FOOD RESEARCH			English	Article						bifidobacteria; Eubacterium hallii; fucose; human milk oligosaccharide; microbiome; trophic interactions	BUTYRATE-PRODUCING BACTERIA; METABOLITE PRODUCTION; GEN. NOV.; PROPIONATE; ACID; RECLASSIFICATION; ENUMERATION	ScopeFucosylated human milk oligosaccharides (fHMOs) are metabolized by Bifidobacterium infantis and promote syntrophic interactions between microbiota that colonize the infant gut. The role of fHMO structure on syntrophic interactions and net microbiome function is not yet fully understood. Methods and resultsMetabolite production and microbial populations are tracked during mono- and co-culture fermentations of 2MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEfucosyllactose (2MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEFL) and difucosyllactose (DFL) by two B. infantis strains and Eubacterium hallii. This is also conducted in an in vitro modeled microbiome supplemented by B. infantis and/or E. hallii. Metabolites are quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Total B. infantis and E. hallii populations are quantified through qRT-PCR and community composition through 16S amplicon sequencing. Differential metabolism of 2MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEFL and DFL by B. infantis strains gives rise to strain- and fHMO structure-specific syntrophy with E. hallii. Within the modeled microbial community, fHMO structure does not strongly alter metabolite production in aggregate, potentially due to functional redundancy within the modeled community. In contrast, community composition is dependent on fHMO structure. ConclusionWhereas short chain fatty acid production is not significantly altered by the specific fHMO structure introduced to the modeled community, specific fHMO structure influences the composition of the gut microbiome.

The food supply chain is no exception. Being competitive has become imperative in terms of sustainability and accountability of the business process. Therefore, organizations are adopting blockchain to track and trace the information flow to ensure a better business process. Further, to ensure sustainability, analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions aids firms in achieving a reasonable improvement in the food supply chain. So, the present study collects carbon emissions data for palm oil production. The study evaluates palm oil production in the Sumatra region, Indonesia (Cradle to Port), through predictive modeling. Here, the palm production process is classified as cultivation, harvesting, and shipping. Then, the study evaluates the GHG emissions from the three phases to understand the carbon footprint in palm oil production. Finally, the study uses blockchain to track and trace the GHG emissions in the palm oil supply chain using Hyperledger Fabric self-executed smart contracts. The study has developed unique contributions in terms of developing predictive modeling, blockchain architecture, and deep learning in palm production to leverage the competitive advantage of the supply chain in the VUCA world for business excellence in the global market.

Methods: A systematic search of multiple databases was conducted in November 2021, and updated July 2022, to identify studies assessing interventions to enhance pre-pregnancy care for women with type 2 diabetes. Over 10% of articles were screened by two reviewers at title and abstract phase, after which all selected full-text articles were screened by two reviewers. Quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for cohort studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to study heterogeneity; therefore, narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Four eligible cohort studies were identified. The conclusions able to be drawn by this review were limited as women with type 2 diabetes (n = 800) were in the minority in all four studies (35%-40%) and none of the interventions were exclusively tailored for them. The uptake of pre-pregnancy care was lower in women with type 2 diabetes (8%-10%) compared with other participant groups in the studies. Pregnancy preparation indicators generally improved among all groups exposed to pre-pregnancy care, with varying impact on pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions: This review demonstrates that previous interventions have had a limited impact on pre-pregnancy care uptake in women with type 2 diabetes. Future studies should focus on tailored interventions for improving pre-pregnancy care for women with type 2 diabetes, particularly those from ethnic minorities and living in poorer communities.

Risk factors for a serious adverse outcome in neonates: a retrospective cohort study of vaginal births	BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						fetal deterioration; intrapartum fetal monitoring; labour outcome; meconium; pyrexia; risk factors	FETAL HEART-RATE; APGAR SCORE; INTRAPARTUM; INFANT; TRIAL	Objective: To investigate the hypothesis that risk factors in addition to an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern (aFHRp) are independently associated with adverse neonatal outcomes of labour.Design: Observational prospective cohort study.Setting: 17 UK maternity units.Sample: 585 291 pregnancies between 1988 and 2000 inclusive.Methods: Adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated from multivariable logistic regression.Main outcome measures: Adverse neonatal outcome at term (5-minute Apgar score <7, and a composite measure comprising 5-minute Apgar score <7, resuscitation by intubation and/or perinatal death).Results: Analysis was based on 302 137 vaginal births at 37-42 weeks inclusive. We found a higher odds of Apgar score at 5 minutes <7 with suspected fetal growth restriction (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.16-1.53), induction of labour (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.25-1.58), nulliparity (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.34-1.63), booking body mass index >= 30 (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02-1.37), maternal age <25 (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.39), black ethnicity (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.43), early-term birth at 37-38 weeks (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25), late-term birth at 41-42 weeks (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.28), use of oxytocin (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.14-1.41), maternal pyrexia (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.46-2.40), aFHRp and presence of meconium (aFHRp without meconium: OR 2.40, 95% CI 2.15-2.69; meconium without aFHRp: OR 2.20, 195% CI.94-2.49; both aFHRp and meconium: OR 4.26, 95% CI 3.74-4.87). The results were similar when the composite adverse outcome was considered.Conclusions: A range of risk factors, including suspicion of fetal growth restriction, maternal pyrexia and presence of meconium, are implicated in poor birth outcomes in addition to aFHRp. Interpretation of the fetal heart rate pattern alone is insufficient as a basis for decisions about escalation and intervention.	[Jindal, S.; Steer, P.

Previous work focused on the synthesis of non-cyclic monofluoroalkenes. However, diastereoselective synthesis of monofluorocyclohexenes from non-cyclic substrates is challenging. Herein, we report the first photocatalyzed cascade cyclization reactions of readily available alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds and gem-difluoroalkenes for the synthesis of highly functionalized monofluorocyclohexenes. The reaction shows broad substrate scope with high diastereoselectivity (>30 examples, up to 86% yield, >20:1 dr). The post-reaction transformations of the products demonstrate the synthetic potential of this methodology.

Herein, N-bromosaccharin is activated by sunlight irradiation. Alternately, a synergistic activation model (Sc(OTf)(3)/HFIP) has also been developed for the activation of haloniums, complementary to the light induced strategy. In addition, the cascade C6-H bromination and benzylic C-H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed. High regio-and chem-selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and scalability demonstrate great potential of the developed methods in practical applications and further functionalization.

Among various cathode candidates for SIBs, Na-based layered transition metal oxides have received extensive attention for their relatively large specific capacity, high operating potential, facile synthesis, and environmental benignity. However, there are a series of fatal issues in terms of poor air stability, unstable cathode/electrolyte interphase, and irreversible phase transition that lead to unsatisfactory battery performance from the perspective of preparation to application, outside to inside of layered oxide cathodes, which severely limit their practical application. This work is meant to review these critical problems associated with layered oxide cathodes to understand their fundamental roots and degradation mechanisms, and to provide a comprehensive summary of mainstream modification strategies including chemical substitution, surface modification, structure modulation, and so forth, concentrating on how to improve air stability, reduce interfacial side reaction, and suppress phase transition for realizing high structural reversibility, fast Na+ kinetics, and superior comprehensive electrochemical performance. The advantages and disadvantages of different strategies are discussed, and insights into future challenges and opportunities for layered oxide cathodes are also presented.

However, conclusive clinical data on PJI caused by NTM are lacking. In this case series and systematic review, the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of NTM PJI are summarized and analyzed. MethodsFrom 2012 to 2020, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive PJI cases caused by NTM in our institution. A literature review was also conducted from January 2000 to December 2021, utilizing the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases to identify all reported NTM-induced PJI cases. The clinical characteristics, demographics, pathogen identification, treatment protocols, and prognosis of NTM PJI were summarized and analyzed. ResultsIn this retrospective analysis, seven patients infected with NTM following total joint arthroplasty at our institution were included, including six cases of PJI caused by NTM and one case of septic arthritis (SA) caused by NTM. There were six men and one woman, and their average age was 62.3 years. The average interval between TJA and PJI onset was 4 months. The preoperative serological markers, including the mean ESR (51 mm/h), CRP (4.0 mg/dL), fibrinogen (5.7 g/L), and D-dimer (1.1 g/L), were increased. Six patients underwent staged revision surgery, and one patient with SA received antibiotic-loaded bone cement beads to treat the infection. After an average of 33 months of observation following surgical intervention, none of the patients showed any symptoms of infection recurrence. From 2000 to 2021, 68 patients with NTM PJI were found in 39 studies in the published literature. Reinfections occurred within 1 year after arthroplasty in more than half (53.2%) of the patients. M. fortuitum and M. abscesses were the most prevalent rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) in all PJI patients, whereas Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAC) was the most prevalent slowly growing mycobacterium (SGM). The corresponding antibiotics were amikacin and ethambutol. The rate of culture-negative without specific clinical symptoms was as high as 36.4% (12/33), while 45% (18/40) utilized additional diagnostic techniques such as NGS. A final clinical follow-up record was available for 59 patients (86.7%; mean follow-up period, 29 months), and 10.1% of patients failed to respond to treatment. ConclusionOrthopaedic surgeons should consider NTM in patients with negative routine cultures who are at risk for Mycobacterium infection. Treatment options rely on the accurate result of microbiologic identification and drug sensitivity testing, and to achieve this, it may be necessary to send multiple culture specimens, extend the culture time, and change the culture medium. Every effort should be made to identify NTM and its various subtypes through modern diagnostic tools if necessary.

How can importers lobbying in their private capacity escape from tariffs without relying on Congress? In the United States, products must be sorted into tariff categories by the customs office before the appropriate duty can be determined. This article documents how firms seek to lower their tariffs by strategically requesting product classifications from customs. Firms hire lawyers to make legal arguments to customs officials promoting an interpretation of the tariff schedule which lowers their costs. Lobbying for favorable classification is most important to the firm when similar categories have very different tariffs. The language of product descriptions is political because legal arguments for a particular classification are more persuasive when the descriptions are worded flexibly. Using a data set of over 200,000 classification rulings between 1990 and 2020, I find evidence that firms request classifications in response to certain quotas and the China tariffs. The findings characterize the tariff schedule as a living document and describe how the distribution of tariffs and the language of product descriptions affect the structure of protection.

Tripartite Uncertainty, Quantum, and Classical Correlations Dynamics under Unruh Effect	ANNALEN DER PHYSIK			English	Article; Early Access						quantum and classical correlations; tripartite entropic uncertainty; Unruh effect	ENTROPIC UNCERTAINTY; MODEL; ENTANGLEMENT; MEMORY; SYSTEM	How the dynamics of classical and quantum correlations due to the Unruh effect are reflected in the properties of tripartite entropic uncertainty is investigated. It is found that, despite the quantum correlations disappearing at the limit of infinite acceleration, the uncertainty about the measurement outcome is at its minimum. This is due to the three-qubit system still containing classic correlations at that stage of acceleration. Additionally, the decrease in the entropic uncertainty when the measured qubit interacts strongly with the scalar field can be attributed to the increase in classical correlations. Furthermore, it is found that the entropic uncertainty is fully anti-correlated to classical correlations, and minimal uncertainty can be obtained even in the absence of quantum correlations. A tremendously tight constraint that effectively defined the properties of tripartite entropic uncertainty based on the difference between the total correlation and the Holevo quantities is achieved.

However, in most liquid electrolytes, the decomposition of organic solvents inevitably forms organic components in the SEI and CEI. In addition, organic solvents often pose substantial safety risks due to their high volatility and flammability. Herein, an organic-solvent-free eutectic electrolyte based on low-melting alkali perfluorinated-sulfonimide salts is reported. The exclusive anion reduction on Li anode surface results in an inorganic, LiF-rich SEI with high capability to suppress Li dendrite, as evidenced by the high Li plating/stripping CE of 99.4% at 0.5 mA cm(-2) and 1.0 mAh cm(-2), and 200-cycle lifespan of full LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (2.0 mAh cm(-2)) || Li (20 mu m) cells at 80 degrees C. The proposed eutectic electrolyte is promising for ultrasafe and high-energy Li metal batteries.

J	Rivenbark, WC; Fasiello, R; Tassi, F				Rivenbark, William C.; Fasiello, Roberta; Tassi, Francesco			The performance function in local government: Does location impact performance data use?	PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access							TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP; MUNICIPAL-GOVERNMENT; MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; CITIZEN; STATE	Research has demonstrated that certain drivers increase the probability of performance data use in local government. One performance driver that has received minimal attention is where the performance function is organizationally located, even though prior research has shown that the organizational placement of the performance function can potentially influence the design and use of performance measurement systems. Our study explores how the organizational placement of the performance function in local government influences key drivers of performance data use. We find evidence that performance functions located outside the budget office are more likely to promote the drivers of measurement system maturity, other management processes, and devolved decision-making, which in turn increases the probability that local officials engage in performance data use. We also identify several research implications to advance the study and practice of performance management in local government and conclude with research limitations and suggestions for future research opportunities.

Wild giraffes live in a fission-fusion society and males and females are rarely in the same herd for a long period. The captive condition of belonging to a herd with the same individuals for months or years is uncommon in nature. To understand the effect of male presence on female stress levels, fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels and social interactions in two captive female giraffes were investigated. Additionally, the effect of enclosure size and temperature on fGCM level and social interactions were examined. The results showed no significant difference in the fGCM levels of females based on male presence. The frequency of agonistic behavior by the dominant female toward the subordinate female was significantly increased when a male was present. The subordinate female was significantly less likely to approach the dominant female and showed decreased affiliative and agonistic interactions toward the dominant female when a male was present. The frequencies of agonistic interactions between females were higher in the small enclosure regardless of male presence. Low temperature triggered higher fGCM levels and increased agonistic interaction in an aged female. The findings of this study suggest that these multiple factors should be considered individually to promote the welfare of captive giraffes.

Prevalence of ASB in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy is unknown. AimsThe aim is to determine the prevalence of ASB in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. MethodsProspective cohort study of 150 pregnant women. Mid-stream urine samples were tested for ASB in the second (24-28(+6)) and third (32-36(+6)) trimesters. Women were assigned to one of two groups: (i) ASB in any trimester of pregnancy and (ii) no evidence of ASB in pregnancy. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between groups. ResultsAmong 143 women included in the study, the rate of ASB was 4.9% (2.1, 2.1 and 3.2% in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively). Of those with ASB, 14% had it in every trimester, whereas 43% had it on two or more samples. Of those with ASB in pregnancy, 43% were detected for the first time in the third trimester. Rates of maternal and neonatal outcomes were not statistically significantly different between the two groups. No women with ASB were induced for chorioamnionitis or growth restriction. ConclusionThe rate of ASB was highest in the third trimester of pregnancy, with rates of 2.1, 2.1 and 3.2% in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. This study was underpowered to assess maternal and fetal outcomes. Although numbers were small, the absence of ASB in the first trimester was a poor predictor of ASB in the third trimester.

Specifically, due to the absence of approximation function, the developed control scheme is more practical. Firstly, a new fixed-time velocity observer is introduced to estimate unmeasured velocities with the homogeneity theory. Then, the performance of the velocity observer in the presence of parametric uncertainties and non-parametric uncertainties is analyzed seriously. Furthermore, a novel distributed continuous fixed-time control (DCFTC) scheme is proposed. Compared with the existing velocity-free controllers, fixed-time convergence is achieved both for velocity estimation and trajectory tracking. More than that, distributed control is realized by using graph theoretic notions. Finally, numerical simulation results and experiment results demonstrate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed velocity estimation method and control algorithms.

The gut mycobiome is an inducer of the host's immunity, maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and protecting against infections, as well as a reservoir of opportunistic microorganisms and a potential cofactor when the host is immunocompromised. In addition, gut fungi interact with a diverse range of microbes in the intestinal niches.

However, due to the high flexibility, high steric hindrance, and low reactivity, it remains challenging to synthesize COFs using ketones as building units, especially the highly flexible aliphatic ones. Here, the single nickel site coordination strategy is reported to lock the configurations of the highly flexible diketimine to transform discrete oligomers or amorphous polymers into highly crystalline nickel-diketimine-linked COFs (named as Ni-DKI-COFs). The strategy has been successfully extended to the synthesis of a series of Ni-DKI-COFs by the condensation of three flexible diketones with two tridentate amines. Thanks to the ABC stacking model with high amount and easily accessible single nickel (II) sites on their 1D channels, Ni-DKI-COFs are exploited as well-defined electrocatalyst platforms for efficiently electro-upgrading biomass-derived 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into value-added 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with a 99.9% yield and a 99.5% faradaic efficiency as well as a high turnover frequency of 0.31 s(-1).

J	Bednarski, A				Bednarski, Aleksander			(Post-)industrial optics: The role of the Hereford Mappa Mundi in Christopher Meredith's <i>Shifts</i>	ORBIS LITTERARUM			English	Article; Early Access						Christopher Meredith; the Hereford Mappa Mundi; industrial fiction; Raymond Williams; Welsh fiction; Welsh writing in English		Christopher Meredith's novel Shifts (1988) is firmly established in the canon of English-language Welsh literature as one of the most accomplished representatives of (post-)industrial fiction, a genre this small country has produced in quality and amount 'out of all proportion to its size or population' (Knight, 2004). The aim of this paper is to explore the role of the medieval Mappa Mundi which two characters see in Hereford Cathedral in the context of the novel's circular structure and a rich network of other visual insets. Looking at the map from a variety of perspectives, including Murray Krieger's concept of ekphrasis as the superimposition of spatial relationships on a text by a visual work of art, I propose to read the fictional continuum of the novel as a mirror image of the medieval orbis terrarum on several planes: compositional, visual-optical and symbolic. This reading is embedded within the broader context of the characteristics of the Welsh industrial novel discussed by Raymond Williams in his essay 'The Welsh industrial novel' (1979).

The COVID-19 lockdown increased poverty in Pakistan by 15%, which was addressed using a $1.5 billion, digitally implemented Ehsaas Emergency Cash (EEC) program that reached 14.8 million poor households. The study's models show that the largest multipliers from Ehsaas program finance were in agriculture, as a 1 Rupee shock adds 0.225 Rupee income to households. About 30% of that gain was estimated to go to poor farm families. In contrast, our models find that construction and trade growth added three times as much income to poor nonfarm and urban households as to farm households. However, those sectors added only one third as much total income as agriculture. From the structural path analysis, the importance of capital assets in generating income was seen, as was the possibility of greater poverty reduction from sectors with proportionally fewer intermediate inputs and more value added.

Current research typically assumes that downstream retailers retain procurement from the encroaching supplier. In reality, however, retailers may have the option of switching suppliers after encroachment. By considering a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer with outside options, this paper analyzes the effects of the option of switching suppliers on the supply chain players' strategic interactions under the threat of supplier encroachment. We consider that the manufacturer makes encroachment decision preceding the retailer's switch decision. We capture various outcomes of the encroachment and switch decisions by using a classic encroachment model with quantity decisions (Cournot model). Specifically, we identify two effects of the outside option on the strategic encroachment decision. The first, the deterrence effect, means that the manufacturer's encroachment is deterred by the threat of switching supplies altogether; while the second, the permissive effect, indicates that the retailer intends to switch to the alternative source after the encroachment. Interestingly, we show that the encroachment could improve the total profit of the incumbent manufacturer and the retailer even when the retailer's switch has occurred. In this case, however, the manufacturer profits while the retailer is hurt by the encroachment and the switch. Finally, we also investigate several extended cases to demonstrate the robustness of our findings.

Because of the strong heterogeneity in carbonate reservoirs, the pore structure is nonlinearly varying and complex in reservoirs. It is necessary to establish a method for pore structure type (PST) prediction. Machine learning provides an efficient prediction method by finding the relationship between core test data and well-logging data. In this paper, a reservoir identification method based on Gradient Boost Decision Trees (GBDT) is proposed for the pore structure characteristics of carbonate reservoirs integrating core test and logging data. Core testing data are utilized to form the training set for PST prediction. Then, we adopt the mutual information method to optimize the logging data as the input of the machine learning model. GBDT hyperparameters are optimized using the learning curve to make it have optimal performance. Finally, we compare the predicted result of GBDT with K-Nearest Neighbor and support vector machines, demonstrating the superior performance of GBDT. The results indicate that the four PS are different in some properties, such as permeability, pore radius and shape of pore and throat. 20%, 10 and 0.15 are recommended as the optimal parameter values for Maximum feature, iteration number and Sub-sample number to improve GBDT accuracy in carbonate reservoir PST prediction. Evaluation indicators of machine learning, including the Kappa coefficient, Heming distance, Jaccard similarity coefficient and Confusion matrices, indicate that GBDT has better performance. This research proves the high accuracy and applicability of machine learning technology in the carbonate reservoir and also provides a meaningful reference for the identification of the carbonate reservoirs in the central area of Iraq.

It does not only change the carrier relaxation in the structure but could also lead to the imbalanced occupation of QDs with charge carriers, because the band structure favors the transfer of holes. Thermal activation of carrier transfer can be observed as an increase in the emission intensity versus temperature for excitation powers below saturation on the level of both an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble and single QD transitions. That increase in the QD emission is accompanied by a decrease in the emission from the InGaAlAs layer at low temperatures. Finally, carrier transfer between the InGaAlAs layer of the DBR and the InAs/InP QDs is directly proven by the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the QD ensemble. The reported carrier transfer can increase the relaxation time of carriers into the QDs and thus be detrimental to the coherence properties of single and entangled photons. It is important to take it into account while designing QD-based devices.

To promote immunotherapy with desired therapeutic efficiency, immunogenic cell death (ICD), a particular type of death capable of reshaping body's antitumor immune activity, has drawn considerable attention due to the potential to stimulate a potent immune response. Still, the potential of ICD effect remains unsatisfactory because of the intricate tumor microenvironment and multiple drawbacks of the used inducing agents. ICD has been thoroughly reviewed so far with a general classification of ICD as a kind of immunotherapy strategy and repeated discussion of the related mechanism. However, there are no published reviews, to the authors' knowledge, providing a systematic summarization on the enhancement of ICD via nanotechnology. For this purpose, this review first discusses the four stages of ICD according to the development mechanisms, followed by a comprehensive description on the use of nanotechnology to enhance ICD in the corresponding four stages. The challenges of ICD inducers and possible solutions are finally summarized for future ICD-based enhanced immunotherapy.

However, the supporting civilian data are mostly from North America with a differing case mix and trauma system and may not be applicable to the Australian environment. The aim of this study is to describe our initial experience with PHTQ from safety and efficacy viewpoints. MethodRetrospective review of all patients with PHTQ from 1 August 2016 to 31 December 2019 was conducted. Data were matched from the RMH Trauma Registry and Ambulance Victoria Registry. Clinical presentation including prehospital observations, PHTQ times, limb outcomes and complications are described. ResultsThirty-one cases met inclusion criteria, for whom median age was 37 (IQR: 23.9-66.3), median ISS 17 (13-34) and 80.6% were male. The majority (n = 19, 61.3%) were as a result of road traffic crash, and six (19.4%) from penetrating mechanisms, usually glass. Over a quarter (29.0%) suffered a traumatic amputation. The median prehospital SBP was 100 (IQR: 80-110), the median prehospital HR was 101 (IQR: 77.0-122.3) and was the median PHTQ time was 124 min (IQR: 47-243). Complications attributable to the tourniquet were seen in 4/30 cases (13.3%). ConclusionThis Australian series differs from North American civilian PHTQ series with a lower penetrating trauma rate and longer PHTQ times. Despite this, complication rates are within the published literature's range. Concerns regarding limited transferability of overseas studies to the Australian context suggests that ongoing audit is required.

MethodsWe enrolled 268 patients with non-valvular AF and 58 sinus rhythm subjects who underwent transesophageal echocardiography in the study. LAA longitudinal strain amplitude (LAA LSA) was defined as the sum of the value of the maximum positive peak strain (LAA PLS) and the absolute value of the minimum negative peak strain (LAA NLS). Dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) was defined as grade 3 or 4 SEC. ResultsCompared to sinus rhythm group, the global LAA strain parameters were significantly lower in paroxysmal AF (n = 148), and the lowest of them were found in persistent AF (n = 120), which suggested that the global LAA strain parameters could evaluate LAA function in sinus rhythm, paroxysmal AF and persistent AF. Compared with patients in AF without SEC/thrombus (n = 113), the regional and global LAA strain parameters were significantly depressed in AF with SEC/thrombus (n = 155). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that LAA global LSA (OR 0.768; 95% CI:0.569, 0.970; p = 0.027) was an independent predicter of the SEC/thrombus. Compared with patients in AF without dense SEC or thrombus (n = 210), the regional and global LAA strain parameters were significantly impaired in the patients with dense SEC/thrombus(n = 58). LAA global LSA (AUC 0.884) had the best predictable accuracy for dense SEC or thrombus, and outperformed LAA PLS, LAA NLS, CHA2DS2-VASc score and conventional LAA functional parameters that have been used in the evaluation blood flow stasis in LAA. LAA LSA showed excellent interobserver and intra-observer agreement beyond LAA PLS and LAA NLS. ConclusionThe novel LAA strain parameters, which were feasible and reproducible parameters for evaluation LAA mechanic function, had good predictive accuracy for blood flow stasis in LAA beyond conventional LAA functional parameters.

However, their potential to host biodiversity is dependent on the structure of the forest: Abrupt edges often fail to realise this potential. Yet, methods to accurately characterise and quantify forest edge abruptness are currently lacking. Here, we combine three-dimensional forest structural data with biodiversity monitoring to assess the influence of forest edge structure on habitat suitability. We derived several structural metrics to determine forest edge abruptness using terrestrial laser scanning and applied these to six forest edge transects in Belgium. The local soundscapes were captured using audio recording devices (Audiomoths) and quantified using acoustic indices (AIs) (metrics on the soundscape characteristics). In each transect, the dawn choruses were recorded over a period of a week, both at the edge and the interior of the forest. No correlation between the AIs and bird species richness was found. There were clear differences between transects in the structural metrics and the recorded soundscapes. Some possible relations between both were found. In this proof of concept, we demonstrated innovative techniques to semi-automatically classify forest structure and rapidly quantify soundscape characteristics and found a weak effect of forest edge structure on bird biophony.

J	Wang, C; Qin, J; Jiao, JW; Ji, F				Wang, Chong; Qin, Jie; Jiao, Jianwei; Ji, Fen			Ccdc25 regulates neurogenesis during the brain development	DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Ccdc25; cerebral cortex; neural stem cell; neurogenesis	NEURAL STEM-CELLS; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE	During brain development, the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) are precisely regulated. Defects in embryonic brain development can lead to serious developmental disorders. The cerebral cortex is the most evolved and complicated structure in the mammalian brain. The process of neuronal production, also known as neurogenesis, plays crucial roles in cerebral development and can affect the function of the neocortex. Ccdc25 is a newly discovered molecule. It has been proved that it can play an important role in tumor. However, its function in neural systems is unclear. In this study, we find that in early embryonic development, Ccdc25 can express in the brain. Suppression of the Ccdc25 mediated by shRNAs causes the increase of the Ki67- or BrdU-positive NSCs proliferation and inhibits the premature terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation. Simultaneously, overexpression of Ccdc2525 inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation of NSCs. Knockdown of Ccdc25 also affects neuronal maturation, the number of branches of neurons cultured in vitro decreased, and the number of axons became shorter. We also examined the expression profile of NSCs when Ccdc25 was knocked down by RNA sequencing technique. We found that Ccdc25 regulates the development of NSCs through Egr1. Egr1 knockdown can result in a phenotype similar to Ccdc25, while the overexpression of Egr1 can also rescue the phenotype of Ccdc25 knockdown. In conclusion, Ccdc25 can affect the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs and the maturation of neuron.

In this review, the basic constitutions, mechanisms, and materials of acoustofluidics are described. Subsequently, sorts of delicately designed acoustofluidic devices, including diverse bulk acoustic wave (BAW) microfluidics and surface acoustic wave (SAW) microfluidics, are discussed, covering principles, advantages, limitations and applications in separation. Besides the introduction of advances of micro/nanoparticle separation in the BAW microfluidics, the SAW microfluidics are elaborated in detail with a focus on various configurations of interdigital transducers (IDTs), comprising straight IDT, slanted-finger IDT, chirped IDT and focused IDT. Microfluidic systems of the acoustofluidics involve the forms of straight channels, serpentine channels, and droplets. Additionally, besides simply structured acoustofluidics, acoustofluidics integrated with other structures are also mentioned. Finally, the prospects and limitations of acoustofluidics in micro/nanoparticle separation are also discussed. The acoustofluidics reviewed here is envisioned as a versatile tool for micro/nanoparticle separation at the cellular, sub-cellular, and biomolecular levels.

Similarly, the C-14-oxidative product suffered from iodination and reacted with amino compounds to afford 3 amine derivatives. Antiproliferative test in vitro exhibited that most of the newly synthesized compounds were more potent than parthenolide toward both human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cell line and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line. Among them, ZA-5 displayed a significant antiproliferative effect against A549 with an IC50 value of 1.03 mu mol L-1 and ZB-1 had a potency almost equal to that of the positive drug Adriamycin toward MDA-MB-231 cells. Finally, a mechanism study showed that ZA-5 could significantly trigger off apoptosis of A549 cells at the test concentration.

We used indirect questions to better map the most curious collaborators at Brazilian organizations. We believe our instrument eludes the Brazilian bias for impression management. Our sample covered 384 respondents in Brazil and identified that there are more curious professionals in small and medium-sized enterprises than in large and multinational companies, and that team members are more curious than those in managerial positions. Furthermore, our study reveals that the most curious perceive to be penalized when offering their perceptions regarding weak signals. This study points the need to invest in developing and protecting a more curiosity-oriented staff. In addition to contributing to the literature on curiosity at work, this study provides insights for companies that want to develop their teams to perceive business weak signals.

There is much uncertainty regarding the comparative risks of new-onset overall cancer and pre-specified cancer for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) versus DPP4I.Methods: This population-based cohort study patients included patients who were diagnosed with T2DM and administered either SGLT2 or DPP4 inhibitors between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2020 in public hospitals of Hong Kong.Results: This study included 60,112 T2DM patients (mean baseline age: 62.1 +/- 12.4 years, male: 56.36%), of which 18,167 patients were SGLT2I users and 41,945 patients were dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4I) users. Multivariable Cox regression found that SGLT2I use was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.84-0.99; p= 0.04), cancer-related mortality (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.42-0.80; p <= 0.001) and new diagnoses of any cancer (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.59-0.84; p <= 0.001). SGLT2I use was associated with a lower risk of new-onset breast cancer (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.32-0.80; p <= 0.001), but not of other malignancies. Subgroup analysis on the type of SGLT2I, dapagliflozin (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64-0.95; p = 0.01) and ertugliflozin (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43-0.98; p = 0.04) use was associated with lower risks of new cancer diagnosis. Dapagliflozin use was also linked to lower risks of breast cancer (HR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27-0.83; p = 0.001).Conclusion: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use was associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and new-onset overall cancer compared to DPP4I use after propensity score matching and multivariable adjustment.

ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination generates spike-specific CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells in aged mice	IMMUNOLOGY AND CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Aging; CD8(+) T cells; immunity; SARS-CoV-2; vaccination	NAIVE; IMMUNITY; DECLINE	Effective vaccines have reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection; however, the elderly remain the most at risk. Understanding how vaccines generate protective immunity and how these mechanisms change with age is key for informing future vaccine design. Cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells are important for killing virally infected cells, and vaccines that induce antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in addition to humoral immunity provide an extra layer of immune protection. This is particularly important in cases where antibody titers are suboptimal, as can occur in older individuals. Here, we show that in aged mice, spike epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells are generated in comparable numbers to younger animals after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, although phenotypic differences exist. This demonstrates that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 elicits a good CD8(+) T-cell response in older bodies, but that typical age-associated features are evident on these vaccine reactive T cells.

We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of nCT with or without nCRT in patients with LARC and to identify patients who may be suitable for nCT alone.Materials and Methods: A total of 155 patients with LARC who received neoadjuvant treatment (NT) were retrospectively analysed from January 2016 to June 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: nCRT (n = 101) and nCT (n = 54). More patients with locally advanced disease (cT4, cN+ and magnetic resonance imaging-detected mesorectal fascia [mrMRF] positive [+]) were found in the nCRT group. Patients in the nCRT group received a dose of 50 Gy/25 Fx irradiation with concurrent capecitabine, and the median number of nCT cycles was two. In the nCT group, the median number of cycles was four.Results: The median follow-up duration was 30 months. The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the nCRT group was significantly higher than that in the nCT group (17.5% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.047). A significant difference was observed in the locoregional recurrence rate (LRR); 6.9% in the nCRT group and 16.7% in the nCT group (p = 0.011). Among patients with initial mrMRF (+) status, the LRR in the nCRT group was significantly lower than that in the nCT group (6.1% vs. 20%, p = 0.007), but not in patients with initial mrMRF negative (-) (10.5% in each group, p = 0.647). Compared with the nCT group, a lower LRR was observed in patients in the nCRT group with initial mrMRF (+) converted to mrMRF (-) after NT (5.3% vs. 23%, p = 0.009). No significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding acute toxicity and overall and progression-free survivals. Multivariate analysis showed that nCRT and ypN stage were independent prognostic factors for the development of LRR.Conclusion: Patients with initial mrMRF (-) may be suitable for nCT alone. However, patients with initial mrMRF (+) converted to mrMRF (-) after nCT are still at high risk of LRR, and radiotherapy is recommended. Prospective studies are required to confirm these findings.

To inform future studies in developing a framework in the management of DNSIs. DesignThis review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021226449) and reported in line with PRISMA guidelines. All studies from 2000 that reported the investigation or management of DNSI were included. The search was limited to English language only. Databases searched included AMED, Embase, Medline and HMIC. Quantitative analysis was undertaken with descriptive statistics and frequency synthesis with two independent reviewers. A qualitative narrative synthesis was conducted using a thematic analysis approach. SettingSecondary or tertiary care centres that undertook management of DNSIs. ParticipantsAll adult patients with a DNSI. Main outcome measuresThe role of imaging, radiologically guided aspiration and surgical drainage in DNSIs. ResultsSixty studies were reviewed. Thirty-one studies reported on imaging modality, 51 studies reported treatment modality. Aside from a single randomised controlled trial, all other studies were observational (n = 25) or case series (n = 36). Computer tomography (CT) was used to diagnose DNSI in 78% of patients. The mean percentage of management with open surgical drainage was 81% and 29.4% for radiologically guided aspiration, respectively. Qualitative analysis identified seven major themes on DNSI. ConclusionsThere are limited methodologically rigorous studies investigating DNSIs. CT imaging was the most used imaging modality. Surgical drainage was commonest treatment choice. Areas of further research on epidemiology, reporting guidelines and management are required.

Taking a surface digital image of Beishan granite as an example, a K-means clustering algorithm is employed to extract the mineral compositions, the distribution of which is quantified by the two-point probability function (TPPF). Given the 3D volume fraction of each mineral composition, their corresponding 3D two-point probability functions can be evaluated from their 2D forms by the linear interpolation method. The 3D GBM reconstruction is generated by a simulated annealing algorithm, with the Monte Carlo algorithm extending the calculation of the two-point probability function as the target function to the random particle model. To improve the computational efficiency, the periodic boundary condition is applied to both the random particle generator and the evaluation of the two-point probability function, allowing large-scale GBM to be generated for the Distinct Lattice Spring Model (DLSM). The elastic response and advantages of the random particle model for the DLSM are investigated. Finally, the DLSM is further enriched with a tension-cutoff Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, and the GBM reconstruction method is successfully tested for reproducing the mechanical behaviours of granite and interpreting the failure mechanism at the mesoscale under different loading conditions.

Southern gains and northern losses: Regional variation in the evolution of black/white earnings differences in the United States, 1976-2017	SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL			English	Article						earnings inequality; gender; occupational segregation; race; regional differences	BLACK-WHITE EARNINGS; LABOR-MARKET; WAGE GAP; RELATIVE EARNINGS; EMPLOYMENT; MEN; INEQUALITY; AMERICANS; TRENDS; WOMEN	We document large differences among regions of the United States in the trends of the black/white earnings gap among full-time workers from 1976 to 2017. Outside the South, the earnings of black workers grew more slowly than those of non-Hispanic white workers. These relative decreases were much larger for women than for men. However, in the South, the racial earnings gap shrank for men, and changed little for women. Thus, we find a substantial convergence across regions in the black/white earnings gap. The most important explanations of the racial earnings gaps are persistent racial differences in educational attainment and persistent occupational segregation. However, differences in observables leave much of the racial earnings gaps unexplained. The regional convergence in the racial earnings gap is evident in both explained and unexplained gaps for both women and men.

Female ticks (<i>Ixodes scapularis</i>) infected with <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> have increased overwintering survival, with implications for tick population growth	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						cold tolerance; ecological immunology; Lyme disease; thermobiology; winter	LYME-DISEASE; ACARI IXODIDAE; ANAPLASMA-PHAGOCYTOPHILUM; SENSU-LATO; BLACKLEGGED TICKS; COLD TOLERANCE; TRANSMISSION; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE; ONTARIO	The tick, Ixodes scapularis, vectors pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Over the last few decades I. scapularis has expanded its range, introducing a novel health threat into these areas. Warming temperatures appear to be one cause of its range expansion to the north. However, other factors are also involved. We show that unfed adult female ticks infected with B. burgdorferi have greater overwintering survival than uninfected female ticks. Locally collected adult female ticks were placed in individual microcosms and allowed to overwinter in both forest and dune grass environments. In the spring we collected the ticks and tested both dead and living ticks for B. burgdorferi DNA. Infected ticks had greater overwintering survival compared with uninfected ticks every winter for three consecutive winters in both forest and dune grass environments. We discuss the most plausible explanations for this result. The increased winter survival of adult female ticks could enhance tick population growth. Our results suggest that, in addition to climate change, B. burgdorferi infection itself may be promoting the northern range expansion of I. scapularis. Our study highlights how pathogens could work synergistically with climate change to promote host range expansion.

A coordinated strategy for a simple, pragmatic approach to the early identification of the ultra-high-risk patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Review						diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; International Prognostic Index; PET-CT; total metabolic tumour volume; p53; double-hit lymphoma	TUMOR VOLUME; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES	Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent aggressive lymphoma seen in clinical practice. Despite huge strides in understanding its biology, front-line therapy has remained unchanged for decades. Roughly one-third of patients have primary refractory or relapse following the end of conventional first-line therapy. The outcome of patients with primary refractory disease and those with early relapse (defined as relapse less than 1 year from the end of therapy) is markedly inferior to those with later relapse and is exemplified by dismal overall survival. In this article, the authors term patients with features that identify them as being at particularly high-risk for either primary refractory disease or early relapse, as 'ultra-high-risk'. As new treatment options become established (e.g. bispecific T-cell engagers, chimeric antigen receptor 'CAR' T-cells and antibody-drug conjugates), it is likely that there will be a push to incorporate some of these agents into the first-line setting for patients identified as ultra-high-risk. In this review, the authors outline advances in positron emission tomography, widely available laboratory assays and clinical prognosticators, which can detect a high proportion of patients with ultra-high-risk disease. Since these approaches are pragmatic and able to be adopted widely, they could be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

Merrill (Fabaceae), and recently became an economically important pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae), in Brazil. This stink bug has two allopatric strains, one prevalent in southern Brazil (SS), and another in the north (NS). The two strains hybridize in central Brazil. Knowledge of host preferences and host suitability of these strains may clarify the contribution of the various gene pools to contemporary adaptive features such as the ability to harm cotton crops. We tested the attraction of the E. heros strains and reciprocal hybrids - female N x male S (HNS) and female S x male N (HSN) - to soybean and cotton leaves and reproductive structures, and evaluated the nymph development and survivorship of the two strains and reciprocal hybrids fed on soybean or cotton. We conducted host-choice experiments with fourth instars and adult females and evaluated the survival of immatures on soybean and cotton plants under laboratory conditions. The SS strain preferred soybean over cotton. Hybrid and NS strains chose randomly between soybean and cotton plants. All strains developed on soybean, with similar survival rates. On cotton, pure strains did not reach adulthood; however, hybrids developed on cotton but with a survival rate of <1%. Our results showed that the SS strain of E. heros was more attracted to soybeans, and NS and hybrid strains had a polyphagous choice behavior, suggesting that current host selection has been mediated by historical and, mainly, contemporary relationships of E. heros strains with these hosts.

People from diverse ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored the identity experiences of care home staff from diverse ethnic backgrounds in the context of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsFourteen semistructured interviews were conducted between May 2021 and April 2022 with ethnic minority care home staff in England, who worked during the pandemic. Participants were recruited using convenience and theoretical sampling. Interviews were conducted via telephone or online platforms. A social constructivist grounded theory methodology was utilised in analysing the data. FindingsParticipants described five key processes which facilitated or hindered the impact that their experiences had on their identity: dealing with uncertainty and transitioning into a COVID-19 world; difficult emotions; experiences of discrimination and racism; the response from the care home and societal systems; and the personal vs collective responsibility. When participants' physical and psychological needs went unmet by support structures within the care home and/or society, they experienced a sense of injustice, lack of control and being unvalued or discriminated against by others. ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of recognising the unique needs of staff from diverse ethnic backgrounds working in care homes and adapting working practices to improve impact on identity, job satisfaction and staff retention. Patient and Public InvolvementOne care home worker was involved in developing the topic guide and helping to interpret the findings.

Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3-5 (CnH2nBr2: n=3-5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2 (n=3-5) tends to result in kinetic products.

AimsThis study explores the factors influencing fathers' intention to attend the birth, and the needs and supports required leading up to childbirth. MethodsCross-sectional survey of 203 prospective fathers attending antenatal appointments at an outer metropolitan public teaching hospital in Brisbane, Australia. ResultsA total of 201/203 (99.0%) participants intended to attend the birth. The reported reasons included: responsibility (99.5%), protectiveness (99.0%), love for their partner (99.0%), the right thing to do (98.0%), desire to see the birth (98.0%), the perception that partners should attend (97.4%), duty (96.4%) and partner preference (91.4%). Some felt pressured by their partner (12.8%), society (10.8%), cultural expectations (9.6%) and family (9.1%), and 10.6% perceived adverse consequences for not attending. Most participants (94.6%) felt well supported, experienced good communication (72.4%), had the opportunity to ask questions (69.8%) and received an explanation of events (66.3%). They were less often supported by antenatal visits (46.7%) and by a plan for future visits (32.2%). Ten per cent of all fathers and 13.8% of experienced fathers requested better mental health support, and 9.0% prefer better clinician communication. ConclusionsMost fathers intend to attend childbirth for personal and moral reasons; however, a small proportion feel pressured. Most fathers feel well supported, although potential improvements include planning for future visits, provision of information, mental health support, clinician communication, increased involvement in their partner's care, the opportunity to ask questions and more frequent clinic visits.

Study designExperimental ex vivo study. Sample populationTen cadaveric hindlimbs of large dogs. MethodsKinetic and 3D-kinematic data was collected while three observers performed the tests on each specimen with intact (INTACT) and transected cranial cruciate ligament (CCLD) and compared using three-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Subjectively estimated CTT (SCTT), obtained during a separate round of testing, was compared to kinematic data by Pearson correlation. ResultsCTT was significantly higher for CCLD than for INTACT for all tests, resulting in 100% sensitivity and specificity. TPCT induced the highest CTT and internal rotation. Intra- and interobserver agreement of translation was excellent. For rotation and kinetics, agreement was more variable. SCTT strongly correlated with the objectively measured values. ConclusionThe CD, TCT and the new TPCT were all accurate and reliable. The high translations and rotations during TPCT are promising, encouraging further development of this test. SCTT was reliable in our experimental setting. Clinical significanceVeterinary manual laxity tests are accurate and reliable in acute CCLR. The TPCT might have potential for the assessment of subtle and rotational canine stifle instabilities. The high reliability of SCTT implies that grading schemes for stifle laxity, similar to human medicine, could be developed.	[Lampart, Marina; Park, Brian H.

The effect of government environmental punishment on enterprise green technology innovation	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						government environmental punishment; green technology innovation; strategic innovation; substantive innovation	PORTER HYPOTHESIS; ECO-INNOVATION; PROTECTION; IMPACT; CHINA; COMPETITIVENESS	Under the conduction of decentralized environmental governance, environmental punishment has become a pivotal complementary tool for local government environment management and an intuitive reflection of governance efficiency. However, the literature concerning the effect of local government environmental punishment towards the green technology innovation of enterprises is void. To bridge this gap, this paper adopts the fixed-effect model to investigate the impact of government environmental punishment on green technology innovation based on the data of China's A-share listed enterprises from 2010 to 2020. The study finds that the punishment can significantly promote enterprises' green technology innovation. The distinction between the type of innovation reveals that environmental punishment promotes substantive green technology innovation of enterprises, while the effect on strategic green technology innovation is not significant. As far as the influence path is concerned, external pressure and internal incentive are both important mechanisms for environmental punishment to facilitate the green technology innovation of enterprises. Heterogeneity analysis demonstrates that the positive effect of punishment on green technology innovation is more prominent in non-state-owned enterprises, heavily polluting industries and regions with strong public awareness of environmental protection. Further discussion reveals that the facilitative effect of punishment on green technology innovation also significantly improves the environmental performance of enterprises. This paper not only confirms the positive role of government intervention in environmental protection, but also provides practical reference for how to improve enterprises' competitiveness.

Combining microspheres and optical or Raman microscopy, super-resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit and enhancement of Raman signals are demonstrated to provide abundant spectroscopic information on materials. However, microsphere-aided super-resolution scanning photocurrent imaging remains challenging to date. Here, based on the photonic nanojet mechanism, a super-resolution photocurrent and spectral microscopy equipped with a scanning tip with silica dielectric microspheres are presented. With such microsphere-aided microscopy, order of magnitude enhancements for single-point Raman and photoluminescence signals can be achieved, and the spatial resolutions for photocurrent and spectral mapping surpass the best resolution of the original confocal system restricted by the diffraction limit. This versatile system enables correlative super-resolution spectral and photocurrent imaging, serving as a reliable tool for comprehensively understanding and uncovering the optoelectronic properties of materials.

We aimed to investigate the associations of SHR with systemic inflammation and clinical outcomes in diabetic inpatients with pneumonia on admission. MethodsA multicenter and retrospective study was conducted among diabetic inpatients with pneumonia on admission via electronic medical records from 2013 to 2019 in Ruijin Hospital, Shengjing Hospital, and China-Japan Friendship Hospital. ResultsThe study included 1631 diabetic inpatients with pneumonia on admission. Patients of the fourth quartile (Q4) of SHR on admission showed significantly elevated systemic inflammation compared with those of the first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), or third quartile (Q3) of SHR, including more white blood cells (9.1 x 10(9)/L in Q4 vs 7.6 x 10(9)/L in Q1, 7.9 x 10(9)/L in Q2, and 8.0 x 10(9)/L in Q3, p < .001), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (7.0 in Q4 vs 3.6 in Q1, 3.8 in Q2, and 4.0 in Q3, p < .001), higher C-reactive protein (52.8 mg/L in Q4 vs 18.9 mg/L in Q1, p < .001; 52.8 mg/L in Q4 vs 28.6 mg/L in Q2, p = .002), higher procalcitonin (0.22 ng/mL in Q4 vs 0.10 ng/mL in Q1, 0.09 ng/mL in Q2, and 0.11 ng/mL in Q3, p < .001), and higher D-dimer (0.67 mg/L in Q4 vs 0.47 mg/L in Q1, 0.50 mg/L in Q2, and 0.47 mg/L in Q3, p < .001). Excluding patients with hypoglycemia on admission in the analyses, there were still distinct J-shaped associations between SHR and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with different severity of pneumonia, especially in those with CURB-65 score for pneumonia severity (Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure) >= 2. In the multivariable regression model, predictive value for adverse clinical outcomes was higher when SHR was taken as a spline term than as quartiles in all patients (area under curve 0.831 vs 0.822, p = .040), and when SHR as a spline term instead of fasting blood glucose was included in patients with CURB-65 >= 2 (area under curve 0.755 vs 0.722, p = .027). ConclusionsSHR was correlated with systematic inflammation and of J-shaped associations with adverse clinical outcomes in diabetic inpatients with pneumonia of different severity. The inclusion of SHR in the blood glucose management of diabetic inpatients may be beneficial, especially for the prevention of potential hypoglycemia or the recognition of relative glucose insufficiency in those with severe pneumonia or high hemoglobin A(1C).

This study presents an accurate spectral element modeling method for cracked slender structural members by using refined waveguide models and a more realistic crack model. Firstly, a spatial spectral beam element model is established for uncracked slender structural member based on the Love rod theory, the modified Timoshenko beam theory, and the Saint-Venant's torsion theory. Then, the complete local additional flexibility matrix for crack in the structural member with rectangular cross section is derived from the theory of elastic fracture mechanics, and a two-node condensed spectral element model considering the stiffness coupling effect caused by the crack is established for cracked slender structural member. The wave response in cracked structures is solved by the numerical inverse Laplace transformation method. A thorough comparison of the wave responses in cracked structural member evaluated by the presented spectral element model and the 3D solid finite element model is given in the numerical example, which verifies the accuracy and high efficiency of the presented method.

However, room-temperature skyrmions in natural metallic antiferromagnetic materials with merit of probable convenient electrical manipulation have not been reported. Here, room-temperature skyrmions are realized in a non-collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer. The evolution of spin textures from coplanar inverted triangular structures to Bloch-type skyrmions is achieved via tuning the magnitude of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Beyond that, the temperature can induce an unconventional transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron-like spin textures at approximate to 220 K in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. Combining with the theoretical calculations, it is found that the transition originates from the temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between kagome sublayers within the Mn3Sn crystalline unit-cell. These findings open the avenue for the development of topological spin-swirling-based antiferromagnetic spintronics.

This transformation tolerates a wide range of amines, which include anilines, alkyl amines, and hydrazines, to afford 60 diverse 3-substituted-2-thixo-4-quinazolinones including 34 new compounds at 60 degrees C for 30 min in good yields.

Recently, several heteroatom-doped carbon catalysts with ORR performances comparable with those of state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts have been reported. However, the intrinsic influence of heteroatoms on the catalytic activity has not been thoroughly investigated to date. This paper reports porous carbons co-doped with N and S, prepared using an ion-exchange resin and tetramethylammonium cations, with an onset potential of 0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a half-wave potential of 0.79 V versus RHE. First-principles calculations reveal that the change in the atomic charge caused by the co-doping of N and S is important for inducing a high ORR activity. This paper presents a rational synthetic strategy for metal-free catalysts and provides fundamental insights into their electrocatalysis.

Tissue-resident memory T cells (T-RM) have been implicated in range of allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory skin diseases. Clonal expansion of cells with T-RM properties is also known to contribute to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Here, we review the heterogeneous phenotypes, transcriptional programs, and effector functions of skin T-RM. We summarize recent studies on T-RM formation, longevity, plasticity, and retrograde migration and contextualize the findings to skin T-RM and their role in maintaining skin homeostasis and altered functions in skin disease.

Evaluating microbial contaminations of alternative heating oils	ENGINEERING IN LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						CO2 monitoring; heating oil storage; microbial activity; oxymethylene ethers; paraffinic heating oils	MECHANISMS; BIODIESEL; FUELS	Since 2008, European and German legislative initiatives for climate protection and reduced dependency on fossil resources led to the introduction of biofuels as CO2-reduced alternatives in the heating oil sector. In the case of biodiesel, customers were confronted with accelerated microbial contaminations during storage. Since then, other fuel alternatives, like hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVOs), gas-to-liquid (GtL) products, or oxymethylene ether (OME) have been developed. In this study, we use online monitoring of microbial CO2 production and the simulation of onset of microbial contamination to investigate the contamination potential of fuel alternatives during storage. As references, fossil heating oil of German refineries are used. Biodiesel blends with fossil heating oils confirmed the promotion of microbial activity. In stark contrast, OMEs have an antimicrobial effect. The paraffinic Fischer-Tropsch products and biogenic hydrogenation products demonstrate to be at least as resistant to microbial contamination as fossil heating oils despite allowing a diversity of representative microbes. Through mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and microbial sequencing, we can discuss fuel properties that affect microbial contaminations. In summary, novel, non-fossil heating oils show clear differences in microbial resistance during long-term storage. Designing blends with an intrinsic resistance against microbial contamination and hence reduced activity might be an option.

Recent studies have revealed that MNPs may cause atherosclerosis, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To address this bottleneck, ApoE(-/-) mice are exposed to 2.5-250 mg kg(-1) polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, 50 nm) by oral gavage with a high-fat diet for 19 weeks. It is found that PS-NPs in blood and aorta of mouse exacerbate the artery stiffness and promote atherosclerotic plaque formation. PS-NPs activate phagocytosis of M1-macrophage in the aorta, manifesting as upregulation of macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO). Moreover, PS-NPs disrupt lipid metabolism and increase long-chain acyl carnitines (LCACs). LCAC accumulation is attributed to the PS-NP-inhibited hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2. PS-NPs, as well as LCACs alone, aggravate lipid accumulation via upregulating MARCO in the oxidized low-density lipoprotein-activated foam cells. Finally, synergistic effects of PS-NPs and LCACs on increasing total cholesterol in foam cells are found. Overall, this study indicates that LCACs aggravate PS-NP-induced atherosclerosis by upregulating MARCO. This study offers new insight into the mechanisms underlying MNP-induced cardiovascular toxicity, and highlights the combined effects of MNPs with endogenous metabolites on the cardiovascular system, which warrant further study.

However, Zn metal anode suffers seriously from dendrite, corrosion, and interface water decomposition in aqueous electrolytes, especially under large areal capacity or long charging duration. This is mainly because of the uneven longitudinal Zn growth induced by the anisotropic Zn2+ diffusion, which is usually neglected in a laboratory study with low areal capacity. Herein, we report an artificial interface of the anodic covalent organic framework (COF, which can be rapidly synthesized and facilely assembled with Zn anode in a large area) to guide the uniform longitudinal Zn growth for dendrite-free Zn batteries. In-situ optical microscope observes that compared with the bare Zn anode, COF interface can promote the formation of the smooth and dendrite-free surface through spatial-triggered uniform longitudinal Zn growth. Theoretical calculation uncovers that anodic COF with a negative charge at its N sites could attract Zn2+ to achieve uniform longitudinal Zn2+ diffusion. In addition, this COF interface with superior hydrophobicity could suppress water decomposition and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the COF-functionalized Zn anode realizes a high coulombic efficiency under severe Zn plating/stripping conditions (10 mAhcm(-2)), contributing to a long Zn-I-2 full battery life of over 10000 cycles. This work highlights the high-areal-capacity Zn anode protection in external space beyond the interface.

When the excitation wavelength is 360 nm and 480 nm, the double emission fluorescence peaks are located at the wavelengths of 477 nm and 523 nm. The former is the fluorescence response signal, and the latter is the fluorescence background signal. The semi-quantitative analysis of Fe3+ was achieved based on the linear relationship between the ratio F-477/F-523 of the two signals and the Fe3+ concentration. The linear range of this method is 0.015-120 mu M, and the limit of detection (LOD, S/N=3) is 5 nM. Meanwhile, the naked-eye visual detection of Fe3+ can be realized according to the fluorescence color of the probe. The probe exhibits excellent anti-interference, selectivity and repeatability, and this method can be applied to the detection of Fe3+ in actual samples.

AD patients are often diagnosed after the appearance of the typical symptoms, thereby delaying the best opportunity for effective measures. Biomarkers could be the key to resolving the challenge. This review aims to provide an overview of application and potential value of AD biomarkers in fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and saliva, in diagnosis and treatment. MethodsA comprehensive search of the relevant literature was conducted to summarize potential biomarkers for AD in fluids. The paper further explored the biomarkers' utility in disease diagnosis and drug target development. ResultsResearch on biomarkers mainly focused on amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques, Tau protein abnormal phosphorylation, axon damage, synaptic dysfunction, inflammation, and related hypotheses associated with AD mechanisms. A beta(42), total Tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), have been endorsed for their diagnostic and predictive capability. However, other biomarkers remain controversial. Drugs targeting A beta have shown some efficacy and those that target BACE1 and Tau are still undergoing development. ConclusionFluid biomarkers hold considerable potential in the diagnosis and drug development of AD. However, improvements in sensitivity and specificity, and approaches for managing sample impurities, need to be addressed for better diagnosis.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we administered rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg body weight) to male C57BL/6J mice for 12 weeks and found that oral rosuvastatin dramatically reduced intraperitoneal glucose tolerance. Rosuvastatin-treated mice showed considerably higher serum levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) than control mice. They also showed dramatically altered expression of BCAA catabolismrelated enzymes in white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, including downregulated mRNA expression of BCAT2 and protein phosphatase 2Cm (PP2Cm) and upregulated mRNA expression of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK). The levels of BCKD in the skeletal muscle were reduced in rosuvastatin-treated mice, which was associated with lower PP2Cm protein levels and increased BCKDK levels. We also investigated the effects of rosuvastatin and insulin administration on glucose metabolism and BCAA catabolism in C2C12 myoblasts. We observed that incubation with insulin enhanced glucose uptake and facilitated BCAA catabolism in C2C12 cells, which was accompanied by elevated Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) phosphorylation. These effects of insulin were prevented by co-incubation of the cells with 25 mu M rosuvastatin. Moreover, the effects of insulin and rosuvastatin administration on glucose uptake and Akt and GSK3 beta signaling in C2C12 cells were abolished when PP2Cm was knocked down. Although the relevance of these data, obtained with high doses of rosuvastatin in mice, to therapeutic doses in humans remains to be elucidated, this study highlights a potential mechanism for the diabetogenic effects of rosuvastatin, and suggests that BCAA catabolism could be a pharmacological target for preventing the adverse effects of rosuvastatin.

Effects of rimegepant 75 mg daily on the pharmacokinetics of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate in healthy female participants	HEADACHE			English	Article; Early Access						calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist; drug-drug interaction; ethinyl estradiol; norgestimate; migraine; oral contraceptive; rimegepant	DOUBLE-BLIND; MIGRAINE; RISK	Objective: To assess the effect of single and multiple doses of rimegepant 75 mg dose on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (EE)/norgestimate (NGM) in healthy females of childbearing potential or non-menopausal females with tubal ligation.Background: Females of childbearing age experience the highest prevalence of migraine and frequently inquire about the concomitant use of anti-migraine medications and contraceptives. Rimegepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, demonstrated efficacy and safety for treating an acute migraine attack and preventing migraine.Methods: This open-label, single-center, phase 1, drug-drug interaction study explored the effects of rimegepant 75 mg daily dose on the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing EE/NGM 0.035 mg/0.25 mg in healthy females of childbearing potential or non-menopausal females with tubal ligation. During cycles 1 and 2, participants received EE/NGM once daily for 21 days followed by placebo tablets with inactive ingredients for 7 days. Rimegepant was administered during only cycle 2 for 8 days, from days 12 through 19. The primary endpoint was the effect of single and multiple doses of rimegepant on the pharmacokinetics of EE and norelgestromin (NGMN), an active metabolite of NGM, at steady state, including area under the concentration-time curve for 1 dosing interval (AUC(0-t,ss)) and maximum observed concentration (C-ss[max]).Results: The study enrolled 25 participants, with pharmacokinetic data assessed for 20 participants. A single 75 mg dose of rimegepant co-administered with EE/NGM increased exposures of EE and NGMN by =16% (geometric mean ratio [GMR], 1.03; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.06; and GMR, 1.16; 90% CI, 1.13-1.20, respectively). After 8 days of co-administering EE/NGM with rimegepant, EE pharmacokinetic parameters, AUC(0-t,ss) and C-ss(max), increased by 20% (GMR, 1.20; 90% CI, 1.16-1.25) and 34% (GMR, 1.34; 90% CI, 1.23-1.46), respectively, and NGMN pharmacokinetic parameters increased by 46% (GMR, 1.46; 90% CI, 1.39-1.52) and 40% (GMR, 1.40; 90% CI, 1.30-1.51), respectively.Conclusions: The study identified modest elevations in overall EE and NGMN exposures after multiple doses of rimegepant, but these elevations are unlikely to be clinically relevant in healthy females with migraine.

NFs can effectively compete to the synthetic fibers in terms of mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties. As a result, the invention and innovation of natural fiber (NF) composites for commercial purposes has increased dramatically in recent years to meet the growing demand of the industrial sectors. Materials are the cornerstone of any manufacturing industry. NFRPCs are a good alternative to conventional materials because of their relatively high mechanical properties and lower production energy. NFs decrease the cost of the material by 5% while reducing the weight of the composite by 10% and the manufacturing energy by 80%. A lot of work has been done to enhance NFRPCs' mechanical properties to overcome their drawbacks, such as poor fiber-to-matrix adhesion, thermal stability, and moisture absorption. However, for better mechanical properties, it is crucial to understand the fibers' embedded manufacturing technique and the appropriate fiber weight percentage with appropriate matrix. This review article discusses composites made of NFs providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the field of NFRPCs, focusing on recent advancements in preparation techniques, improvements in mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural and impact strength of NFRPCs with various fiber types, fiber weight ratio, fiber-to-matrix ratio for appropriate engineering applications, and elucidating future research directions by analyzing trends and challenges in the field. The aim of this review article is to provide a deep evaluation of the progress made in the field of NFRPCs, with the ultimate goal of advancing knowledge and understanding of this field.

J	Dror, L				Dror, Lidal			The rage we should have: Comments on Myisha Cherry's <i>The Case for Rage</i>	SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY			English	Article								In The Case for Rage, Myisha Cherry demonstrates that antiracist rage can be instrumentally valuable, a fitting response to racism, and, therefore, wrong for us to dismiss. That is, on Cherry's account, antiracist anger is useful, fitting, and (in some sense) permissible. In this article, I argue that we should go beyond saying that this antiracist rage is permissible, that the correct thing to say is that people should have antiracist anger, and that anger should be of a (somewhat) specific intensity. I further argue that this antiracist anger must also involve action, because the mere experiencing of Lordean rage is not a sufficient act of "resistance." I lastly argue that we should countenance more "destructive" forms of antiracist rage as permissible, including what Cherry calls "ressentiment rage."

Spectra processing pipeline consisted of dimensionality reduction, which was performed using principal component analysis (PCA), followed by classification step using such methods as support vector machine (SVM), multilayered perceptron (MLP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF). In order to increase the efficiency of lesion classification, several data fusion methods were applied to the classification results: majority voting, stacking, and manual optimization of weights. The results of the study showed that in most of cases the use of data fusion methods increased the average multiclass classification accuracy from 2% up to 4%. The highest accuracy of multiclass classification was obtained using the manual optimization of weights and reached 94.41%.

Age at diagnosis (prenatal, neonatal, infancy, early childhood or childhood) prevalence (all-type and type-specific), and prevalence ratios (PR) were calculated. We fit joinpoint regression models to describe the average annual percentage change (APC) in prenatal diagnosis over time, and log-binomial regression models to estimate the association between prenatal diagnosis and demographic characteristics.Results Prenatal diagnosis prevalence between the first (1980-1989: 28.3 per 10,000 births) and last (2005-2014: 156.1 per 10,000 births) decades of the study increased 5.5-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0, 5.9). Substantial increases were observed for cardiovascular (PR 10.7, 95% CI 8.0, 14.6), urogenital (PR 10.5, 95% CI: 8.7, 12.6) and chromosomal anomalies (PR 7.0, 95% CI 5.9, 8.3). Prenatal diagnosis was positively associated with the birth year (adjusted risk ratio [RR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.03, 1.04), advanced maternal age (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11, 1.18), multiple anomalies (RR 2.86, 95% CI 2.77, 2.96) and major anomalies (RR 3.75, 95% CI 3.36, 4.19), and inversely associated with remoteness (RR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.95) and Aboriginality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83, 0.97).Conclusions Increases in prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies were observed in Western Australia from 1980 to 2020, reflecting advances in screening. Prenatal diagnosis was less common in remote regions and in Aboriginal children, strengthening calls for increased provision of antenatal care services for these populations.

On the other hand, the application of metal-porphyrins in the field of biomedical science as nanozymes is gaining substantial importance. Porphyrins are the most widely studied tetrapyrrole-based compounds because of their important roles in vital biological processes and they possess peculiar photochemical, photophysical, and photo/redox properties. Herein, we demonstrate the use of pH-responsive and photo-crosslinked polymersomes for loading beta-cyclodextrin-Hemin complexes as potential peroxidase-mimicking cavity. The loading of catalytic active centers into polymeric vesicles represents a simple and effective strategy for enzyme mimicry. Physicochemical and enzyme-like properties are studied using a variety of characterization methods at different simulated microenvironments. This work offers an improvement of the aqueous solubility of the Hemin molecule, crucial for biomedical applications. In addition, these nanocompartments can be used as artificial radical-producing and hydrogen peroxide-consuming organelles, being able to replace cell functions in different microenvironments. Therefore, these artificial organelles, entrapping nanozymes, could provide promising synergistic and more personalized therapies on demand in modern nanomedicine.

Background DataMINST has shown to result in favorable clinical and radiographic improvements in intrabony defects. However, it is not clear which types of intrabony defects are most suitable for this treatment. MethodsClinical and radiographic analyses were carried out in a total of 71 intrabony defects treated with MINST belonging to two previously published studies. Baseline defect characteristics were analyzed and related to clinical and radiographic outcomes at 12 months post-MINST with or without adjunctive enamel matrix derivative. ResultsNo associations were detected between defect depth, angle and predicted number of walls and clinical and radiographic healing 12 months post-MINST. ConclusionsNo evidence emerged for associations between defect characteristics and healing following MINST. These data seem to suggest that factors other than defect morphology may influence treatment response to MINST.

Stereochemistry and functions of the new cysteinyl-resolvin, 4S,5R-RCTR1, in efferocytosis and erythrophagocytosis of human senescent erythrocytes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY			English	Article							LIPID MEDIATORS; TISSUE REGENERATION; RESOLUTION; ACID; NEUROINFLAMMATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; INFLAMMATION; MACROPHAGES; MECHANISMS; CLEARANCE	Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators play key functions in the resolution of the acute inflammatory response. Herein, we elucidate the stereochemical structure of the new 4S,5R-RCTR1, a cysteinyl-resolvin, recently uncovered in human leukocytes incubated with a 4S,5S-epoxy-resolvin intermediate, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and ultra-violet (UV) spectrophotometry. With this approach, the physical properties of the new mediator prepared by total organic synthesis were matched to enzymatically produced biogenic material. In addition, we confirmed the potent biological actions of 4S,5R-RCTR1 with human M2-like macrophage phagocytosis of live bacteria, efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and erythrophagocytosis of senescent human red blood cells in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.1 to 10 nM. Taken together, these results establish the complete stereochemistry of 4S,5R-RCTR1 as 5R-glutathionyl-4S,17S-dihydroxy-6E,8E,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid and give evidence of its novel bioactivities in human phagocyte responses. Moreover, they confirm and extend the stereoselective functions of the 4S,5R-RCTR1 with isolated human phagocytes of interest in the resolution of inflammation.

They do so, in part, by copying the products of their western counterparts with a degree of modification. This approach is referred to as Shanzhai, which is a Chinese neologism meaning "copycat." In this article, we discuss the Shanzhai phenomenon and explain Shanzhai's development stages and threats to original brands across the globe. Then, we examine how cultural factors (i.e., power distance belief, face consciousness, and analytic vs. holistic-thinking style) influence consumers' perception towards Shanzhai products. We further suggest that original manufacturers should adopt selected strategies to combat Shanzhai threats vis-a-vis three cultural drivers. One driver entails launching full product lines and developing new distribution channels in high power distance belief cultures but promoting brand originality in low power distance belief cultures. A second alternative involves embracing a sustainable and green brand image in low face-sensitive cultures but strengthening brand logo impacts and enhancing intangible brand benefits-such as social value (e.g., brand user profile, prestige)-in high face-sensitive cultures. The third entails communicating integrated product values in holistic-thinking cultures but highlighting an offering's most competitive and unique features in analytic-thinking cultures.

An increasing body of research describes the phenomenon of implicit racial bias among providers and how it may affect communication, treatment decisions, the patient care experience, and health outcomes. This synthesis of literature reviews and distills current research on the presence and influence of implicit racial bias among nurses as it may relate to maternal and pregnancy-related care and outcomes. In this paper, we also summarize what is known about implicit racial bias among other types of healthcare providers and interventions that can mitigate its effects, identify a gap in research, and recommend next steps for nurses and nurse researchers.

From a database of 2526 tumours collected from 2003 to 2020, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of the main trends in diagnosis, age, multiplicity and anatomical distribution as well as a case-control study comparing these cases with the contemporaneous canine population of the Canary Archipelago to analyse breed distribution. In line with former studies, we found histiocytomas mostly affect young dogs (2, IQR 1-5) and mast cell tumours affect middle-to-old dogs (8, IQR 6-10) with grade 1 affecting at younger ages (6.5, IQR 6-8) than both grade 2 (8, IQR 6-10 years) and grade 3 (9, IQR 7-11). Histiocytomas and plasmacytomas showed a similar anatomical distribution appearing mainly on the face, head and neck regions while mast cell tumours occur mainly on limbs and trunk. Higher risk for mast cell tumours and histiocytomas were found for Bulldog-related breeds such as Boxer (ORMCT = 23.61, CI95%: 19.12-29.15, ORHCT = 10.17, CI95%: 6.60-15.67), Boston Terrier (ORMCT 19.47, CI95%: 7.73-49.05, ORHCT 32.61, CI95%: 11.81-90.07) and Pug (ORMCT 8.10, CI95%: 5.92-11.07, ORHCT 7.87, CI95%: 4.66-13.28) while Chihuahua dogs showed significantly less risk (ORMCT 0.18, CI95%: 0.09-0.33, ORHCT 0.41, CI95%: 0.21-0.78). Notably, the Canarian Mastiff, a local breed, had a low risk of suffering from a mast cell tumour which raises the question of whether this relates to a genetic peculiarity of this breed or some husbandry and environmental factor.

Most beneficial effects of AR are attributed to the major triterpenoids, whose contents are relatively high in AR. To date, only 25 triterpenoids in AR have been characterized by LC-MS because the low-mass diagnostic ions are hardly triggered in MS, impeding structural identification. Herein, we developed an advanced data post-processing method with abundant characteristic fragments (CFs) and neutral losses (NLs) for rapid identification and classification of the major triterpenoids in AR by UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE. ObjectiveWe aimed to establish a systematic method for rapid identification and classification of the major triterpenoids of AR. MethodsUPLC-Q-TOF-MSE coupled with an advanced data post-processing method was established to characterize the major triterpenoids of AR. The abundant CFs and NLs of different types of triterpenoids were discovered and systematically summarized. The rapid identification and classification of the major triterpenoids of AR were realized by processing the data and comparing with information described in the literature. ResultsIn this study, a total of 44 triterpenoids were identified from AR, including three potentially new compounds and 41 known ones, which were classified into six types. ConclusionThe newly established approach is suitable for the chemical profiling of the major triterpenoids in AR, which could provide useful information about chemical constituents and a basis for further exploration of its active ingredients in vivo.

Effect of enhanced nutrition services with community-based nutrition services on the diet quality of young children in Ethiopia	MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION			English	Article						community-based nutrition; diet diversity; Ethiopia; infant and young child feeding; minimum meal frequency; nutrition services	COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING PRACTICES; MASS-MEDIA; INTERVENTIONS; DIVERSITY; INFANT; FOOD; AGRICULTURE; COUNTRIES; EDUCATION; AFRICA	Poor diet quality related to inadequate complementary feeding is a major public health problem in low and middle-income countries including Ethiopia. Low dietary diversity has been linked to negative health outcomes in children. To provide a package of interventions to close nutritional gaps through agriculture, the Sustainable Undernutrition Reduction in Ethiopia (SURE) programme was set up as a multi-sectoral initiative and the results of combined effects of community-based and enhanced nutrition services, compared to community-based alone, on diet diversity and diet quality of complementary feeding of young children are presented. The study used pre- and post-intervention design. Baseline (n = 4980) data were collected from May to July 2016, and follow-up (n = 2419) data from December 2020 to January 2021. From 51 intervention districts having the SURE programme, 36 intervention districts were randomly selected for baseline and 31 for the follow-up survey. The primary outcome was diet quality: minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF) and minimum acceptable diet (MAD). Comparing endline to baseline over the 4.5-year intervention, the use of standard community-based nutrition services of growth monitoring and promotion increased (16%-46%), as did enhanced nutrition services of infant and young child feeding counselling, and agricultural advising (62%-77%). Women involved in home gardening significantly increased (73%-93%); however, household production of food decreased yet consumption of most own-grown foods increased. Importantly, MAD and MDD increased four-fold. The SURE intervention programme was associated with improvements in complementary feeding and diet quality through enhanced nutrition services. This suggests programmes targeted at nutrition-sensitive practices can improve child feeding in young children.

It is shown that the symmetry-breaking processes behave much more deterministic than could be deduced from energy considerations. The two qualitatively different cases of dynamical control are identified depending on robustness against thermal fluctuations. The first case is robust against thermal fluctuations even if the magnetic transition control parameter is changed adiabatically. The second case is unstable against temperature fluctuations and the result of symmetry breaking is random. If the magnetic transition control parameter is rapidly changed, control over the final magnetic state is regained. This phenomenon is related to precession of magnetic momentum, and therefore, it is not noticeable in methods considering and minimizing energy of the magnetic systems directly.

However, deposition efficiency and the quality of the microstructures obtained by this method on optimal parameters are identified by a large number of comparative experiments, resulting in high cost and inefficient practices. For this reason, herein, the fabrication process of metal microstructures by MCED simulation and optimizes parameters affecting deposition quality and rate is investigated. First, the finite-element method is used to simulate the voltage and copper ion concentration identifies the target range. Then, the electrodeposition rate 1 x 10(-7) m s(-1) is set as the target value. The best applicable values of 0.29 V and 0.46 m are obtained after optimizing the voltage and copper ion concentration that affects the quality of deposited microstructures and rate of MCED based on the genetic algorithm (GA), cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, and support vector regression (SVR) algorithm. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out according to the optimized parameters values. The results show that the maximum error of deposition rate is 7.9%. This study pioneers a new approach to achieving efficient and high-quality deposition by MCED.

The results showed that energetic thermoplastic polymer enabled the fuel-rich propellant a faster flame spread, greater flame strength, and a stronger injection effect of metal droplets. The weight loss (Delta m) of the propellants increased with GAP content, while the weight loss rate (D-max) increased similarly. The Delta m increased from 7.92% to 9.86% and D-max from -0.23% center dot degrees C-1 to -0.35% center dot degrees C-1 in the range 100-256.5 degrees C. The propellant with the highest GAP content (85GAP-Prop) had the lowest apparent activation energy (150.77 kJ center dot mol(-1)). The average pressure rate of 85GAP-Prop burning in a closed bomb reached 7.67 MPa center dot s(-1) and the maximum instantaneous pressure rate could reach 16.52 MPa center dot s(-1), significantly higher than the other propellants. The combustion products analysis indicated that the higher GAP content in the GAP-IPDI energetic thermoplastic polymer more significantly reduced the agglomeration of Al particles and improved the loosening of the combustion products. The rapid combustion gas generation characteristic and energy release of energetic thermoplastic polymer enhanced the combustion characteristics of the fuel-rich propellant based on Al-Mg, which promoted dispersion level between the metal droplets. This work provides insight into the combustion principles and performance improvements of fuel-rich propellant based on Al-Mg.

However, the mechanism of temperature-induced metabolic rearrangement, especially important intracellular metabolic events, remains poorly understood. In this work, in order to explore the mechanisms of temperature-induced cell metabolism, we systematically assessed the differences in cell growth, anti -body expression, and antibody quality between high-producing (HP) and low-producing (LP) CHO cell lines under both constant temperature (37 degrees C) and temperature downshift (37 degrees C -> 33 degrees C) settings during fed-batch culture. Although the results showed that low-temperature culture during the late phase of exponential cell growth significantly reduced the maximum viable cell density (p < 0.05) and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, this temperature downshift led to a higher cellular viability and increased antibody titer by 48% and 28% in HP and LP CHO cell cultures, respectively (p < 0.001), and favored antibody quality reflected in reduced charge heterogeneity and molecular size heterogeneity. Combined extra-and intra-cellular metabolomics analyses revealed that temperature downshift significantly downregulated intracellular glycolytic and lipid metabolic pathways while upregulated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and particularly featured upregulated glutathione metabolic pathways. Interestingly, all these metabolic pathways were closely associated with the maintenance of intracellular redox state and oxidative stress-alleviating strategies. To experimentally address this, we developed two high-performance fluorescent biosensors, denoted SoNar and iNap1, for real-time monitoring of intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + hydrogen (NAD(+)/NADH) ratio and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) amount, respectively. Consistent with such metabolic rearrangements, the results showed that temperature downshift decreased the intracellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio, which might be ascribed to the re-consumption of lactate, and increased the intracellular NADPH amount (p < 0.01) to scavenge intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by the increased metabolic requirements for high-level expression of antibody. Collectively, this study provides a metabolic map of cellular metabolic rearrangement induced by temperature downshift and demonstrates the feasibility of real-time fluorescent biosensors for biological processes, thus potentially providing a new strategy for dynamic optimization of antibody production processes.

J	Favez, L; Simon, M; Serdaly, C; Zúñiga, F				Favez, Lauriane; Simon, Michael; Serdaly, Christine; Zuniga, Franziska			Expanded role of nurses in Swiss nursing homes and their engagement in quality improvement: A cross-sectional study	NURSING OPEN			English	Article						advanced practice nursing; nurses; nursing homes; quality improvement; quality of health care	HEALTH-CARE; CHALLENGES	Aims: To report on the engagement of Swiss nursing homes and of nurses in expanded roles in quality improvement.Design: A cross-sectional study (2018-2019).Methods: Survey data from a sample of 115 Swiss nursing homes and 104 nurses in expanded roles. Descriptive statistics were used.Results: Most participating nursing homes reported carrying several quality improvement activities (median of eight out of 10 activities surveyed) but some were only engaged in five activities or less. Nursing homes working with nurses in expanded roles (n = 83) showed greater engagement in quality improvement than those working with none. Nurses with more advanced qualifications (Bachelor's or Master's degree) engaged more in quality improvement than nurses with standard training. Specifically, higher educated nurses were more involved in data-focused activities. Using nurses in expanded roles can be a way forward for nursing homes seeking to actively carry out quality improvement in their facilities.Conclusion: Although a large proportion of nurses in expanded roles surveyed were implementing quality activities, their level of engagement depended on their educational level. Our findings support the principle that higher level competencies are a key aspect of data-based quality improvement in nursing homes. However, as Advance Practice Registered Nurses will remain difficult to recruit in nursing homes, using nurses in expanded roles might contribute to quality improvement.

Specifically, it investigates whether distinct clinical profiles of hospitalized patients can be discerned, what other characteristics they are linked with, and which profiles predict involuntary admission. MethodsIn this cross-sectional multicentre population study, data were collected for 1067 consecutive admissions in all public psychiatric clinics of Thessaloniki, Greece, during 12 months. Through Latent Class Analysis distinct patient clinical profiles were established based on Health of the Nation Outcome Scales ratings. The profiles were then correlated with sociodemographic, other clinical, and treatment-related factors as covariates and admission status as a distal outcome. ResultsThree profiles emerged. The "Disorganized Psychotic Symptoms" profile, combining positive psychotic symptomatology and disorganization, included mainly men, with previous involuntary hospitalizations and poor contact with mental health services and adherence to medication, indicating a deteriorating condition and chronic course. tau he "Active Psychotic Symptoms" profile included younger persons with positive psychotic symptomatology in the context of normal functioning. The "Depressive Symptoms" profile, characterized by depressed mood coupled with nonaccidental self-injury, included mainly older women in regular contact with mental health professionals and treatment. The first two profiles were associated with involuntary admission and the third with voluntary admission. ConclusionsIdentifying patient profiles allows the examination of the combined effect of clinical, sociodemographic, and treatment-related characteristics as risk factors for involuntary hospitalization, moving beyond the variable-centered approach mainly adopted to date. The identification of two profiles associated with involuntary admission necessitates the development of interventions tailored to chronic patients and younger persons suffering from psychosis respectively.

J	Guo, XR; Guo, JP; Zhang, DL; Yun, YX				Guo, Xiaoran; Guo, Jianping; Zhang, Da-Lin; Yun, Yuxing			Vertical divergence profiles as detected by two wind-profiler mesonets over East China: Implications for nowcasting convective storms	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						boundary layer; mesoscale; observational data analysis; remote sensing	BOUNDARY-LAYER HEIGHTS; INTENSE SQUALL LINE; DEEP CONVECTION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; HEAVY RAINFALL; INITIATION; RADAR; VORTICITY; IMPACT; MOTION	Low-level convergence is one of the most important dynamic variables in governing the convection initiation (CI) and development of storms. However, our ability to obtain high-resolution horizontal divergence profiles remains limited due to the lack of high-resolution vertical wind observations. In this study, horizontal divergence (and vertical motion) profiles are derived from horizontal winds measured by two radar wind-profiler (RWP) mesonets in East China, and then used to examine their relationship with CI occurring within a mesonet and an intense squall line moving across another mesonet. Results show that the RWP mesonets together with automated surface observations could provide realistically the lower-tropospheric profiles of horizontal divergence (and upward motion) associated with the CI in the presence of the urban heat island effects, and lake and sea breezes; and the evolution of the squall line respectively. High-resolution surface observations resolve better divergence induced by localized CI than the RWP measurements, whereas the latter capture well significant convergence below 4-km altitude that precedes the onset of squall precipitation. A statistical analysis of the RWP data during the summer months of 2018 indicates that the lower-tropospheric convergence can be detected up to about 40 min in advance of the occurrence of heavy rainfall, and the correlation is higher when it is closer to the heavy rainfall time. Nearly 40% of heavy rainfall moments (at 6-min intervals) are accompanied by strong convergence signals occurring mostly near the top of the boundary layer. This work indicates that the RWP and surface wind measurements should be integrated to aid in nowcasting the location and timing of CI and development of convective storms.

Hospital admissions of school-age children with an intellectual disability: A population-based survey	DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							HEALTH-CARE; PEOPLE; DIAGNOSIS; INQUIRY	AimTo describe the profiles of hospital admissions of school-age children identified with a learning disability (ICD-11 intellectual developmental disorder) and/or safeguarding needs compared to children without learning disability, in a population where proactive identification of learning disabilities in children is embedded in practice. MethodData were collected about the reasons for and duration of hospital admissions of school-age children living in the study catchment area between April 2017 and March 2019; the presence (or absence) of learning disability and/or safeguarding flags in the medical record was also noted. The impact of the presence of flags on the outcomes was explored using negative binomial regression modelling. ResultsOf 46 295 children in the local population, 1171 (2.53%) had a learning disability flag. The admissions of 4057 children were analysed (1956 females; age range 5-16 years, mean 10 years 6 months, SD 3 years 8 months). Of these, 221 out of 4057 (5.5%) had a learning disability, 443 out of 4057 (10.9%) had safeguarding flags, 43 out of 4057 (1.1%) had both, and 3436 out of 4057 (84.7%) had neither. There was a significantly increased incidence of hospital admissions and length of stay in children with either or both flags, compared to children with neither. InterpretationChildren with learning disabilities and/or safeguarding needs have higher rates of hospital admissions than children without. Robust identification of learning disabilities in childhood is required to make the needs of this group visible in routinely collected data as the first step towards needs being appropriately addressed.

We leverage insights from the literature on psychological distancing and affective intensity to argue that linguistic styles, as the manifestation of social psychological distance, have a negative impact on P2P funding success. Testing our arguments with data from a major Chinese P2P platform, we find that using too many "you" and negations (proxies for social psychological distance) in the borrower's description will dampen a lender's willingness to support a funding campaign. Moreover, when the social psychological distance is large, language intensity can be perceived as desperate, making a lender even less willing to support the funding campaign. Our research shed new light on the role of language in P2P funding success and has practical implications for lenders, borrowers and regulators in overcoming barriers in P2P lending.

J	Hwang, SH; Seo, SD; Kim, DW				Hwang, Suk-Ho; Seo, Seung-Deok; Kim, Dong-Wan			A Novel Time-Saving Synthesis Approach for Li-Argyrodite Superionic Conductor	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						all-solid-state batteries; Li-argyrodite; microwave-assisted synthesis; sulfide solid electrolytes; superionic conductors	SOLID-STATE BATTERIES; ACETONITRILE; CRYSTALS; LI6PS5CL; REDOX	The wet-chemical synthetic approach for Li-argyrodite superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) is promising as it saves time, energy, and cost, while achieving scalable production. However, it faces certain commercialization issues such as byproduct generation, nucleophilic attack of the solvent, and long processing times. In this study, a facile and time-saving microwave-assisted wet synthesis (MW-process) approach is proposed for Li6PS5Cl (LPSC), which is completed in 3 h at the precursor-synthesis stage. The LPSC crystal obtained from the MW-process presents various advantages such as fast-PS43- generation, high solubility of LiCl, and low adverse effects from solvent molecules. These features help in achieving a high Li-ion conductivity (2.79 mS cm(-1)) and low electric conductivity (1.85x10(-6) mS cm(-1)). Furthermore, the LPSC crystal is stable when reacting with Li metal (2000 h at 0.1 mA cm(-2)) and exhibits superior cyclability with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2 (NCM622) (145.5 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C, 200 cycles with 0.12% of capacity loss per cycle). The proposed synthetic approach presents new insights into wet-chemical engineering for sulfide-based solid-electrolytes (SEs), which is crucial for developing ASSBs from a commercial-scale perspective.

We linked national disability registration data with the National Health Insurance claims data. Ageand sex-standardized prevalence of osteoporosis were analyzed from2008 to 2017 according to sex, disability type, and disability grade. Adjusted odds ratios for osteoporosis according to disability characteristics in the most recent years' data were also confirmed by multivariate analysis. Over the past decade, the prevalence of osteoporosis has increased in people with disabilities compared with people without disabilities, and the gap has gradually widened from7% to 15%. By analysis of themost recent year data, bothmale and female individuals with disabilities had a higher risk of osteoporosis than those without disability (odds ratios [OR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-1.73 inmales; OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.27-1.28 in females); themultivariate-adjusted OR was especially prominent in disability related to respiratory disease (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.93-2.21 in males; OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.60-1.90 in females), epilepsy (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.78-2.61 in males; OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.53-1.91 in females), and physical disability types (OR 2.09, 95% CI 2.06-2.21 inmales; OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.69-1.71 in females). In conclusion, the prevalence and risk of osteoporosis have increased in people with disabilities in Korea.

J	Kovacevic, T; González-Cataldo, F; Militzer, B				Kovacevic, Tanja; Gonzalez-Cataldo, Felipe; Militzer, Burkhard			The homogeneous mixing of MgO and H<sub>2</sub>O at extreme conditions	CONTRIBUTIONS TO PLASMA PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						DFT-MD; high pressure; H2O; MgO; planetary interiors; superionic ice; water worlds	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PLANETS; WATER; EARTH; ROCK; MISCIBILITY; INTERIORS; CURVE; ICE	Investigating water worlds presents a unique opportunity to understand the fundamental processes of planetary formation and evolution. One key aspect is characterizing the interactions between water and rock under the pressures and temperatures present within these worlds. Investigating the conditions for the homogeneous mixing of these materials is imperative to characterizing bulk properties and evolution of water-rich exoplanets. Here we use density functional molecular dynamics simulations to study MgO-H2O mixtures at high pressure-temperature conditions where H2O occurs in solid, superionic, or liquid form. MgO, the representative rocky material, can be either solid or liquid. We start from 500 K at 120 GPa, increasing the temperature step by step up to 8000 K. By inspection, we determine the temperature at which MgO-HO homogeneously mix in our simulations. At 6000 K and 174 GPa is when we find the system to homogeneously mix. This heat-until-it-mixes approach provides us with an upper bound on the temperature for the mixing of MgO and H2O. We find that homogeneous mixing occurs at sufficiently low temperatures to be relevant for the collisional growth of a water-rich planet.

Perioperative anaphylaxis management and testing: a quaternary centre audit	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article; Early Access						allergy; anaesthesia; anaphylaxis		BackgroundAnaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Sequential reports have cited anaphylaxis as the most common cause of anaesthesia-related deaths. We undertook an audit at a quaternary centre, examining the management of perioperative anaphylaxis and quality of referrals made to our anaesthesia allergy testing service. MethodsThe data of 41 patients consulted at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne for perioperative anaphylaxis between 17th of January 2020 and 20th of January 2022 were analysed. Intervention outcomes included total intravenous fluid administered, adrenaline administration, instigation of CPR and the collection and the timing of serum tryptase samples. We also assessed referral quality, provision of institutional allergy alert and time elapsed from the anaphylaxis event to allergy testing. Contemporaneous Australian and New Zealand Anaesthetic Allergy Group (ANZAAG) guidelines were used as the reference standard for most outcomes. ResultsOur data reveals compliance of <80% with respect to intravenous fluid administration, referral quality and tryptase sampling, particularly at the 4-h timepoint. ConclusionSurgical leadership and patient advocacy in the post-acute phase would likely facilitate requisite testing and improve the quality of counselling. We recommend institutions adopt a case-by-case review of management compliance with recommendations. Additionally, we advocate for the inclusion of a prompt to the ANZAAG referral form, that encourages the operator to update their patient's institutional allergy alert while awaiting allergy testing.

Executive functioning skills of children with listening difficulties	PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS			English	Article						ADHD; auditory processing disorder; executive functions; inhibitory control; listening difficulty	AUDITORY PROCESSING DISORDER; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DIFFERENTIAL-DIAGNOSIS; LANGUAGE IMPAIRMENT; ACADEMIC OUTCOMES; WORKING-MEMORY; FOLLOW-UP; ATTENTION; ADHD; MANAGEMENT	Children with normal hearing who present with listening difficulties (LiD) are frequently referred for assessment of auditory processing disorder (APD). Complicating diagnosis is the similarities of APD to other neurodevelopmental disorders, especially attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Due to well-documented deficits in executive functioning (EF) in children with ADHD, we hypothesized that a possible root cause of observed listening deficits may be EF deficits, rather than auditory processing alone. For preliminary investigation into this hypothesis, the current study compared EF skills of children with LiD who were referred for APD assessment, with and without a diagnosis of ADHD. EF skills of 24 children between the ages of 7-16 were assessed utilizing the Behavioral Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome in Children, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, 2nd edition. Compelling differences were found between groups of children with LiD. Children without ADHD scored lower on measures of inhibitory control compared to children with a diagnosis of ADHD. Decreased EF skills exhibited in children with LiD, even those without a diagnosis of ADHD, support the need for transdisciplinary identification and management of children with LiD.

Orlistat mouth rinse: Using the tongue to deliver antiobesity medication in a double-blind randomized crossover pilot trial	DIABETES OBESITY & METABOLISM			English	Article						fat sensing; obesity; orlistat; tongue	LINOLEIC-ACID; OBESITY-PRONE; FOOD-INTAKE; FAT TASTE; DIETARY; PREFERENCE; CD36	Aim: To investigate the effects of an orlistat mouth rinse on the intake of a high-fat meal. Methods: A double-blind, balanced order, crossover study was conducted in participants (n = 10, body mass index 25-30 kg/m(2)) assigned to receive placebo or orlistat (24 mg/mL) prior to a high-fat meal. Participants were divided into low- or high-fat consumers based on calories consumed from fat following placebo administration. Results: The orlistat mouth rinse decreased total and fat calories consumed during the high-fat meal in high-fat consumers, and did not alter calories consumed in lowfat consumers (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Orlistat decreases long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) absorption by inhibiting lipases that breakdown triglycerides. Orlistat mouth rinse decreased fat intake in high-fat consumers, suggesting that orlistat inhibited the detection of LCFAs from the high-fat test meal. Lingual delivery of orlistat is predicted to eliminate the risk of oil incontinence and promote weight loss in individuals who prefer fat.

Carbon deposit formation is thermodynamically favored above 350 degrees C, even in some hydrogen-rich environments. We discuss four basic mechanisms: a carbenium-ion based mechanism taking place on acid sites of zeolites or bifunctional catalysts, a metal-induced formation of soft coke (i.e., oligomers of small olefins) on bifunctional catalysts, a radical-mediated mechanism in higher-temperature processes, and fast-growing carbon filament formation. Catalysts deactivate because carbon deposits block pores at different length scales, or directly block active sites. Some deactivated catalysts can be re-used, others can be regenerated or have to be discarded. Catalyst and process design can mitigate the effects of deactivation. New analytical tools allow for the direct observation (in some cases even under in situ or operando conditions) of the 3D-distribution of coke-type species as a function of catalyst structure and lifetime.

To address this gap, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview and to explore the current research states and hotspots in this field.Materials and Methods: Publications on H. pylori from 2002 to 2021 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database (WoSCC). Trends in publications and citations were analyzed using Excel 2021. VOSviewer and Citespace were used to perform bibliometrics analysis.Results: 36,266 publications on H. pylori were retrieved from the WoSCC database. In general, we observed an increasing trend in the number of publications over the past 20 years. The United States was the most productive and influential country, with the largest proportion of both publications and total citations. Helicobacter, US Department of Veterans Affairs, and Graham, David were the most productive journals, institutions and authors, respectively. Further analysis the co-occurrence and burst detection of keywords revealed that the most common keywords were "Helicobacter pylori," "gastric cancer," and "gastritis," all keywords were divided into eight main clusters, and the most important current research hotspot was the relationship between H. pylori infection and the changes of gut microbiota.Conclusions: The United States has been the most productive and influential country on H. pylori research, and H. pylori-related research remains an active research field. The relationship between H. pylori infection and the changes of gut microbiota is a research hotspot attracting significant attention.

We investigated if treatment for OUD led to improvements in patients' recovery capital (RC) overtime, and whether there were associated changes in co-occurring alcohol use. MethodsParticipants (n = 133) were patients with OUD seeking outpatient treatment, who completed the Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) and reported drinking days per 30-day period thrice over the 6-month study. No specific treatments targeting alcohol were used. Two different models were employed to assess changes in total ARC score and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for past 30-day abstinence. ResultsBaseline mean ARC scores were 36.6 and significantly increased to mean score of 41.2 at study end. Ninety-one participants (68.4%) reported no alcohol use at baseline, and 97 (78.9%) reported no use in the previous 30 days at study endpoint. For each increase in ARC, there was an aOR 1.07 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.13) for past 30-day abstinence. Considering ARC standard deviation of 10.33 over all measurements, this equates to an aOR of 2.10 (CI: 1.22-3.62) for past 30-day abstinence. Discussion and ConclusionsWe saw significantly increased aOR for past 30-day abstinence as RC improved in an OUD treatment-seeking population. This difference was not caused by differences in ARC between study completers and noncompleters. Scientific SignificanceShowcases how RC growth may be protective of past 30-day alcohol use in an OUD cohort and adds specific aOR for abstinence per ARC increase.

This study reports the conclusions of a bibliometric analysis of LI-US. Input data for the period between 1995 and 2022, including 7209 related articles in the field of LI-US, were collected from the core library of the Web of Science (WOS) database. Using these data, a set of bibliometric indicators was obtained to gain knowledge on different aspects: global production, research areas, and sources analysis, contributions of countries and institutions, author analysis, citation analysis, and keyword analysis. This study combined the data analysis capabilities provided by the WOS database, making use of two bibliometric software tools: R software and VOS viewer to achieve analysis and data exploration visualization, and predicted the further development trends of LI-US. It turns out that the United States and China are co-leaders while Zhang ZG is the most significant author in LI-US. In the future, the hot spots of LI-US will continue to focus on parameter research, mechanism discussion, safety regulations, and neuromodulation applications.

Victor; Li, Bingxin; Wang, Zhan			Swap variance hedging and efficiency: The role of high moments	JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH			English	Article							CURRENCY FUTURES; RISK-AVERSION; SPECULATION; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; RATIOS	In this article, we propose a new theoretical approach for developing hedging strategies based on swap variance (SwV). SwV is a generalized risk measure equivalent to a polynomial combination of all moments of a return distribution. Using the S&P 500 index and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot and futures price data, as well as simulations by varying the distribution of asset returns, we investigate the dynamic differences between hedge ratios and portfolio performances based on SwV (with high moments) and variance (without high moments). We find that, on average, the minimizing-SwV hedging suggests more short futures contracts than minimizing-variance hedging; however, when market conditions deteriorate, the minimizing-SwV hedging suggests fewer short positions in futures. The superior posthedge performances of the mean-SwV hedged portfolios over the mean-variance hedged portfolios in highly volatile or extremely calm markets confirm the efficiency of the mean-SwV hedging strategy.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may reduce parental burden. The Strategies to Enhance CGM Use in Early Childhood (SENCE) trial randomized parents of children (ages 2 to <8 years) with type 1 diabetes to CGM with family behavioural intervention (CGM + FBI), CGM alone (Standard-CGM) or blood glucose monitoring for 26 weeks before receiving CGM + FBI (BGM-Crossover). This report assesses changes in psychosocial outcomes for all groups over 52 weeks.Methods: CGM + FBI (n = 45), Standard-CGM (n = 42) and BGM-Crossover (n = 44) participants completed psychosocial assessments at baseline, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. Repeated measures linear regression models evaluated change within and between treatment groups.Results: The BGM-Crossover group reported improved diabetes burden (? -6.9, 95% CI [-11.3, -2.6], p = 0.003), fear of hypoglycaemia (? -6.4, CI [-10.1, -2.6], p = 0.002) and technology satisfaction (? 7.3, CI [2.4, 12.2], p = 0.005) from 26 to 52 weeks, similar to published findings in the CGM + FBI group over the first 26 weeks. The Standard-CGM group reported increased technology satisfac-tion (? 7.3, CI [0.6, 14.0], p= 0.027) from baseline to 52 weeks. The CGM + FBI group reported less diabetes burden and fear of hypoglycaemia from baseline to 52 weeks, but changes were not statistically significant. Scores from 26 to 52 weeks did not deteriorate.Conclusions: Parents demonstrated psychosocial benefits following FBI that appeared to maintain without additional intervention. CGM-focused education with behavioural support likely helps parents of young children with type 1 dia-betes reduce burden and worry in the short-and long- term.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological adjunctive effects of aPDT using indocyanine green (ICG) in residual sites with probing depth (PD) >= 5 mm during PMT in comparison with scaling and root planing (SRP) alone. MethodsA split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted with 24 individuals in a PMT program. Contralateral quadrants with eligible residual sites were randomly assigned to either SRP + aPDT (test group) or SRP alone (control). aPDT included ICG dye and diode laser (909 nm) performed together with SRP and repeated 15 days after. Periodontal clinical parameters, periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) index, and subgingival biofilm samples were collected at baseline (T1), 3 (T2), and 6 months later (T3). Microbiological analyses were performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. ResultsSignificant improvements were observed in all clinical and microbiological parameters in both groups from T1 to T3. However, no significant differences were observed regarding plaque index, PD, and clinical attachment level. Test group showed significantly greater reductions in bleeding on probing (BOP), PISA index, and Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans levels, when compared with controls. ConclusionsBoth treatments resulted in significant clinical periodontal improvements, but with no significant differences between groups except from inflammation parameters. aPDT using ICG resulted in significant reductions in BOP and PISA index, as well as in P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans levels.

Firstly, an augmented system of the nonzero-sum game is constructed to describe the tracking problem. Thus, the optimal tracking problem is treated as solving the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations of the augmented system. To restrict the number of sampling states, a novel triggering threshold containing the augmented states is designed, and it avoids the existence of Zeno behavior. Secondly, a single-critic network is utilized to approximate the solution of the coupled HJ equations. The critic network turning law with experience replay technology relaxes the dependence on the persistence of excitation (PE) conditions in traditional integral reinforcement learning (IRL) by using historical data in the stack. Moreover, the augmented system states and the critic NN weight errors are uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) by Lyapunov theory. Simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the availability of the proposed algorithm.

Little is known about effective interventions to improve men's outcomes. We conducted a scoping review of interventions aimed to increase ART initiation and/or early retention among men in SSA since universal treatment policies were implemented. MethodsThree databases, HIV conference databases and grey literature were searched for studies published between January 2016 to May 2021 that reported on initiation and/or early retention among men. Eligibility criteria included: participants in SSA, data collected after universal treatment policies were implemented (2016-2021), quantitative data on ART initiation and/or early retention for males, general male population (not exclusively focused on key populations), intervention study (report outcomes for at least one non-standard service delivery strategy), and written in English. ResultsOf the 4351 sources retrieved, 15 (reporting on 16 interventions) met inclusion criteria. Of the 16 interventions, only two (2/16, 13%) exclusively focused on men. Five (5/16, 31%) were randomised control trials (RCT), one (1/16, 6%) was a retrospective cohort study, and 10 (10/16, 63%) did not have comparison groups. Thirteen (13/16, 81%) interventions measured ART initiation and six (6/16, 37%) measured early retention. Outcome definitions and time frames varied greatly, with seven (7/16, 44%) not specifying time frames at all. Five types of interventions were represented: optimising ART services at health facilities, community-based ART services, outreach support (such as reminders and facility escort), counselling and/or peer support, and conditional incentives. Across all intervention types, ART initiation rates ranged from 27% to 97% and early retention from 47% to 95%. ConclusionsDespite years of data of men's suboptimal ART outcomes, there is little high-quality evidence on interventions to increase men's ART initiation or early retention in SSA. Additional randomised or quasi-experimental studies are urgently needed.

The preparation of alpha- and beta-functionalized alpha-amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/coppercatalyzed chemo- and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2-azadienes to access functionalized alpha-amino nitriles by using redox-active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding alpha-amino nitrile building blocks in 50-95% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity > 95 : 5). The products were transformed into prized alpha-amino nitriles and alpha-amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.

Although there are two distinct processes of bone formation, intramembranous and endochondral ossifications contributing to the formation of calvarial and long bones, it is not clear whether the distinct pathways determine the differences between calvaria and femoral cortical bone derived osteocytes. In the present study, we employed confocal structured illumination microscopy and mRNA-sequencing analysis to characterize the morphologic and transcriptomic expression of osteocytes from murine calvaria and mid-shaft femoral cortical bone. Structured illumination microscopy and geometric modelling showed round shaped and irregularly scattered calvarial osteocytes compared to spindle shaped and orderly arrayed cortical osteocytes. mRNA-sequencing analysis indicated different transcriptomic profiles between calvarial and cortical osteocytes and provided evidence that mechanical response of osteocytes may contribute to geometrical differences. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis showed that these two groups of osteocytes come from distinct pathways with 121 ossification-related genes differentially expressed. Analysis of correlation between ossification and osteocyte geometries via a Venn diagram showed that several genes related to ossification, cytoskeleton organization and dendrite development were differentially expressed between calvarial and cortical osteocytes. Finally, we demonstrated that aging disrupted the organization of dendrites and cortical osteocytes but had no significant effects on calvarial osteocytes. Together, we conclude that calvarial and cortical osteocytes are different in various aspects, which is probably the consequence of their distinct pathways of ossification.

The uncertainty quantification approach based on parametric statistics is employed together with the Monte-Carlo simulation method for modeling the randomness of remaining fatigue life. The impact of several commonly-used parametric statistics is investigated, and the pertinent one is identified utilizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed framework is validated through the use of experimental fatigue life data under two-step loading test.

Analytical performance evaluation of two automated urine chemistry analyzers using two levels of commercially available quality control material	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							ESTERASE TEST-STRIP; CANINE MICROALBUMINURIA; PH-METER; DIPSTICK; ASSURANCE; URINALYSIS; CATS	Objective: Evaluate two point-of-care urine chemistry analyzers, VetScan SA and VetLab UA using assayed, bilevel (two concentrations) urine quality control material to determine if performance is acceptable for semiquantitative clinical urine chemistry analysis. Materials and Methods: Normal and abnormal urine quality control material sent to 23 veterinary practices was evaluated three times by each clinic on in--clinic automated urinalysis instruments. Accuracy, precision and clinical utility were evaluated. Results: Normal urine quality control material: Results for blood, glucose, ketones and bilirubin were 100% accurate and precise for both analyzers, and pH values were accurately acidic to neutral. However, pH from VetScan SA had clinically significant negative bias. Abnormal urine quality control material: VetScan SA: blood, microalbumin and bilirubin were 100% accurate; glucose, ketones, and protein demonstrated <= 10% inaccuracy; pH demonstrated 34% inaccuracy. VetLab UA: blood, ketones and bilirubin were 100% accurate; glucose and protein demonstrated <= 10% inaccuracy; pH was 100% accurately neutral to alkaline. Clinical Significance: VetScan SA had marked negative pH bias versus VetLab UA resulting in clinically significant, overly acidic results. Specific gravity, nitrite, and leukocyte test pads should not be used. Both instruments had excellent performance in normal quality control material. While blood, glucose, protein and bilirubin are correctly identified as present in abnormal quality control material, exact concentrations cannot be interpreted due to imprecision. Only semiquantitative results, not numerical values implying quantification, should be reported from urine test strips.	[Hokamp, J.

Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and it is difficult for them to self-repair large bone defects. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone-repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)-complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co-doped N-acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel-MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel-MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS2 improves the hydrogel system, which has excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the Gd-complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradually released Gd3+ from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, this strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone-defect-repair materials and is expected to represent a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

J	Lantigua, D				Lantigua, David			TRANSLATING<i> BUEN</i><i> VIVIR:</i> LATIN AMERICAN INDIGENOUS CULTURES, STADIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND COMPARATIVE RELIGIOUS ETHICS	JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS ETHICS			English	Article						Indigenous flourishing; colonial history; critical anthropology; extractive development; Amazon; Pachamama; poverty; comparative method	DISCOURSE; PEOPLES	This article considers the methodological limits and possibilities of a cultural turn in comparative religious ethics by "translating" the Latin American Indigenous meanings of buen vivir (living well), a subsistent mode of interdependent flourishing resistant to Western models of extractive development amid the Anthropocene. It problematizes the methodological challenge of translating Indigenous cultures from within a Western colonial political economy that has historically relegated Indigenous Americans to the primitive level of savage inferiority according to a stadial theory of socioeconomic development. However, constructive methodological options for translating Indigenous cultures emerge from the Journal of Religious Ethics's existing conversations about comparative religious ethics. On the one hand, recent critical anthropology and ethnography, abetted by intellectual history, provide tools for ethicists in the recovery of Indigenous critiques and meanings against longstanding Western cultural patterns. On the other hand, nativizing the concept of the religious classic thematizes the normative dimensions of Indigenous cultures, demonstrating how the translation of buen vivir points to intercultural dialogue rather than cooptation and manipulation.

Quantification of spinal bone marrow fat fraction using three-material decomposition technique on dual-energy CT: A phantom study	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						bone edema; CT; dual-energy; fat fraction; three-material decomposition	MINERAL DENSITY; IN-VIVO; MRI; FRACTURES; ACCURACY; LESIONS; EDEMA	BackgroundTwo-material decomposition is insufficient to quantify the fat fraction of spinal bone marrow, which is comprised of a mixture of bone minerals, water, and yellow marrow (fat). PurposeTo develop an accurate three-material decomposition-based bone marrow fat fraction (FF3MD$F{F_{3MD}}$) quantification technique for dual-energy CT. MethodsBone marrow edema phantoms containing trabecular bone minerals, water, and fat were constructed using fat fractions and bone mineral density values matching those expected in healthy and edematous bone, and scanned on a commercial dual-energy CT. Fat quantified by FF3MD$F{F_{3MD}}$ were compared to MRI-based fat fraction (FFMRI$F{F_{MRI}}$) and conventional two-material-decomposition-based fat fraction (FF2MD$F{F_{2MD}}$) to evaluate its accuracy and dependency on various bone mineral densities. ResultsFF3MD$F{F_{3MD}}$ demonstrated an excellent correlation with FFMRI$F{F_{MRI}}\;$(r = 0.97, R-2 = 0.96) in the phantom, significantly more accurate than FF2MD when confounding bone minerals are present (50 mg/cm(3): r = 1.02, R-2 = 0.95 vs. r = 0.65, R-2 = 0.79 (p < 0.01); 100 mg/cm(3): r = 0.81, R-2 = 0.47 vs. r = 0.21, R-2 = 0.21 (p < 0.05)). ConclusionsFF3MD$F{F_{3MD}}$ accurately quantified bone marrow fat fraction, when compared with FFMRI$F{F_{MRI}}$, in the specially constructed bone marrow phantom.

Synthesizing the findings of prior studies, the authors propose an integrative theoretical framework for understanding different perspectives, psychological mechanisms, and outcomes of retail exclusion, and highlight research opportunities for retail exclusion in two contexts of service encounters: interpersonal and technology-powered. The review aims to provide implications on proactive strategies to minimize the adverse effects of retail exclusions and promote inclusive customer experiences.

The disease caused by TAHV ("Valtice fever") was detected in people with acute flu-like illness in the 1960s, and later the medical significance of TAHV became the subject of many studies. Although TAHV infections are widespread, the prevalence and number of actual cases, clinical manifestations in humans and animals and the ecology of transmission by mosquitoes and their vertebrate hosts are rarely reported. Despite its association with meningitis in humans, TAHV is a neglected human pathogen with unknown public health importance in Central Europe, and a potential emerging disease threat elsewhere in Europe due to extreme summer flooding events.

The relative helix orientation in these dimers was investigated at high resolution using X-ray diffraction analysis. In several cases, racemic crystallography was used to facilitate crystallization and structure determination. All structures were solved by direct methods. Well-defined parallel helical hairpin motifs were observed in all cases when 4,4 '-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate was employed as a dimerizing agent, irrespective of primary sequence and chain length.

SEM analysis and X-ray diffraction underpinning the nanofibrillar formation, and rheological measurements confirmed the processablity and material fabrication. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA4 via cooperative intermolecular non-covalent interactions makes it as effective electron donor in the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The TENG based on GCNA4-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triboelectric pair generated an output voltage, current and power density of similar to 250 V, 40 mu A and similar to 622 mW/m(2) respectively, which is almost 2.4 times better in performance than the amorphous GCNA4 based TENG. The fabricated TENG can power-up 240 LEDs, wrist watch, thermometer, calculator and hygrometer.

Implementing a group-based multi-component early child development intervention through the government health system in rural Bangladesh: A feasibility study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						government health system; lead exposure prevention; maternal and child nutrition; multi-component group-based intervention; responsive stimulation; WASH	INTEGRATION; CHALLENGES; LESSONS; CARE	Children in low- and middle-income countries face an increased risk of impaired cognitive development due to contaminated environments, poor nutrition, and inadequate responsive stimulation from caregivers. Implementing multi-component, community-level interventions may reduce these risks; however, there is little evidence supporting implementation of these interventions at scale. We assessed the feasibility of implementing a group-based intervention that included responsive stimulation, maternal and child nutrition, water and sanitation, and childhood lead exposure prevention through the government health system in Chatmohar, Bangladesh. After implementation, we conducted 17 in-depth interviews with frontline health service providers and 12 key informant interviews with their supervisors and managers to explore the facilitators and difficulties implementing such a complex programme within the health system. Factors facilitating implementation included: high quality training and skill level of providers, support from community members, family, and supervisors, positive relationships between providers and participants, and provision of children's toys and books free of cost. Difficulties included increased workload of the providers, complicated group-based yet stage-specific delivery where providers had to manage a large group of mother-child dyads representing many different child age-groups at once, and logistics difficulties in providing toys and books through a centralised health system process. Key informants made suggestions to ensure effective government-level scale-up including engaging relevant NGOs as partners, identifying feasible ways to make toys available, and offering providers meaningful even if non-monetary rewards. These findings can be used to shape the design and delivery of multi-component child development interventions to be delivered through the health system.

Combining corn N recommendation tools for an improved economical optimal nitrogen rate estimation	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							YIELD RESPONSE; REFLECTANCE SENSOR; MODEL; FERTILIZER; SOIL; WEATHER; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; REGRESSION; TEXTURE	Improving corn (Zea mays L.) nitrogen (N) rate fertilizer recommendation tools can improve farmers' profits and mitigate N pollution. Numerous approaches have been tested to improve these tools, but to date improvements for predicting economically optimum N rate (EONR) have been modest. This work's objective was to use ensemble learning to improve our estimation of EONR (for a single at-planting and split N application timing) by combining multiple corn N recommendation tools. The evaluation was conducted using 49 corn N response trials from eight states in the US Corn Belt and three growing seasons (2014-2016). Elastic net and decision tree approaches regressed EONR against three unique tools for each N application timing. Tools used in various combinations included a yield goal method, two soil nitrate tests (pre-plant and late season), a computer simulation crop model (Maize-N), and canopy reflectance sensing. Any combination of two or three N recommendation tools improved or maintained performance metrics (R-2, root-mean square error , and number of sites close to EONR). The best results for a single at-planting recommendation occurred when combining the three at-planting N recommendation tools (including interactions) with an elastic net regression model. This combined recommendation tool had a significant linear relationship with EONR (R-2 = 0.46), an increase of 0.27 over the best tool evaluated alone. Combining multiple tools increased the implementation cost, but it did not reduce profitability and, sometimes, improved profitability. These results show tools can be combined to better match EONR, and thus could aid farmers in improving N management.

It is caused by three fungal species that are morphologically identical and have overlapping geographic and host ranges. Controlling GSB is challenging due to the lack of resistant cultivars and the pathogens' significant ability to develop resistance to systemic fungicides. The causal agent of GSB is recognized as a complex of three phylogenetically distinct species belonging to domain Eukaryota, kingdom Fungi, phylum Ascomycota, subphylum Pezizomycotina, class Dothideomycetes, subclass Pleosporomycetida, order Pleosporales, family Didymellaceae, genus Stagonosporopsis, species cucurbitacearum, citrulli, and caricae. Pycnidia are tan with dark rings of cells around the ostiole measuring 120-180 mu m in diameter. Conidia are 6-13 mu m long, hyaline, cylindrical with round ends, and non- or monoseptate. Pseudothecia are black and globose in shape and have a diameter of 125-213 mu m. Ascospores are 14-18 x 4-6 mu m long, hyaline, ellipsoidal with round ends, and monoseptate with a distinct constriction at the septum. Eight ascospores are found per ascus. The upper end of the apical cell is pointed, whereas the lower end of the bottom cell is blunt. Species-specific PCR primers that can be used in a multiplex conventional PCR assay are available. The GSB species complex is pathogenic to 37 species of cucurbits from 21 different genera. S. cucurbitacearum and S. citrulli are specific to cucurbits, while S. caricae is also pathogenic to papaya and babaco-mirim (Vasconcellea monoica), a related fruit. Under favourable environmental conditions, symptoms can appear 3-12 days after spore germination. Leaf spots often start at the leaf margin or extend to the margins. Spots expand and coalesce, resulting in leaf blighting. Active lesions are typically water-soaked. Cankers are observed on crowns, main stems, and vines. Red to amber gummy exudates are often seen on the stems after cankers develop on cortical tissue.

This study aimed to compare the risk of vascular embolism after recombinant type III collagen implants and hyaluronic acid (HA) injection into arteries. MethodsDifferent concentrations of recombinant type III collagen and Restylane were injected into the central ear artery of rabbits, to construct an immediate embolization model. We screened for vascular recanalization and tissue necrosis at 30 min, 1 day, and 7 days after injection, and histopathology examination was processed on Day 7. ResultsAt 30 min after injection, complete recanalization of the central ear artery was observed in 17 rabbits in the C1 group while none in the HA group. On Day 1 after injection, complete recanalization of the CEA main trunk was observed in all rabbits in the collagen group while 50% in the HA group. There was a significant difference between the C1 group and the HA group in terms of vascular recanalization and skin necrosis. ConclusionUnder the present experimental conditions, the risk of causing vascular embolism was much lower with collagen than with Restylane. Different doses of collagen at different injection rates have the same safety profile.

J	Thurgate, C; Griggs, C				Thurgate, Claire; Griggs, Chloe			Nursing associates 6 years on: A review of the literature	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Review; Early Access						career development; nursing associates; organisational readiness; support; worker and learner		AimThis paper reviews the empirical research evidence relating to the nursing associate (NA) role since its implementation in England in 2017. BackgroundThe NA role arose from the findings of the Raising the Bar: Shape of Caring Review (Willis, 2015). The roles' aim is to bridge the gap between healthcare assistant and registered nurse as part of the nursing team, working with people of all ages in a variety of health and social care settings. NAs must successfully complete a trainee programme (usually a Foundation Degree) which, for many, has been completed as an apprentice while remaining in their place of work. MethodsA literature search was performed using the British Nursing Index and CINAHL Plus, along with Google Scholar. Exact key words were 'Nursing Associates' and papers were refined to primary research only. Data restrictions were applied from 2017 to the end of September 2022. Each paper was critically appraised to assess the robustness and validity of the search processes and then thematic analysis was undertaken using Braun and Clarke's (Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2006 and 77) six stages of analysis. ResultsNineteen papers were identified; six key themes emerged: lack of support from others; career development; organisational readiness; resilience in the face of adversity; cost; and worker and learner identity. ConclusionThe NA role is allowing career progression for those who would have historically been prevented from accessing the nursing workforce because of entry qualifications and financial limitations. There is a need for organisational readiness to ensure trainee nursing associates (TNA) are supported during their training, that they have equal opportunities to learn, and they are given the status and recognition as a learner. Organisations need to raise awareness among staff to allow the nursing team to understand the NA role. Relevance to clinical practiceThis literature review has relevance for those who employ Nursing Associates or who are considering introducing the role. No patient or public consultationDue to being a literature review no patient or public consultation took place; however, local employers identified the need for a review of the literature pertaining to the Nursing Associate role.

Herbarium (AAU), collected in Ecuador, revealed specimens of undescribed species and species that were mentioned as endemic in the catalog of plants of Colombia Piper dolichostylum, P. littlei, P. morelianum, P. sanandresense and P. tarquiense resulting of incomplete curation of herbarium collections in institutions that launched expeditions to the Amazon and the Andes. Piper svenningii (Piperaceae) from the eastern slopes of the Andes and adjacent lowlands in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, is described as a new species and illustrated, and a morphological comparison with similar species is made. Piper svenningii differs from P. costatum and P. japurense by its leaves which have induplicate margins, versus leaf margins flat and not induplicate. It differs from Piper rurrenbaqueanum by having leaves that are pinnately nerved throughout with 10-12 pairs of secondary nerves, versus 4-6 pairs of secondary nerves that are pinnately arranged in the basal two thirds of the lamina.

Here, we explored genome-wide divergence within the Asiatic toad, Bufo gargarizans, to study local adaptation and genomic offset (i.e., the mismatch between current and future genotype-environment relationships) under climate warming scenarios. We obtained high-quality SNP data for 94 Asiatic toads from 21 populations in China to study spatial patterns of genomic variation, local adaptation, and genomic offset to warming in this wide-ranging species. Population structure and genetic diversity analysis based on high-quality SNPs revealed three clusters of B. gargarizans in the western, central-eastern, and northeastern portions of the species' range in China. Populations generally dispersed along two migration routes, one from the west to the central-east and one from the central-east to the northeast. Both genetic diversity and pairwise F-ST were climatically correlated, and pairwise F-ST was also correlated with geographic distance. Spatial genomic patterns in B. gargarizans were determined by the local environment and geographic distance. Global warming will increase the extirpation risk of B. gargarizans.

J	Zhu, LJ; Peng, L; Ding, SC; Liu, ZR				Zhu, Liangjun; Peng, Li; Ding, Shuchen; Liu, Zhongren			An encoder-decoder framework with dynamic convolution for weakly supervised instance segmentation	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article; Early Access						image segmentation; object detection	NEURAL-NETWORKS	In the systems of industrial robotics and autonomous vehicles, instance segmentation is widely employed. However, manually labelling an object outline is time-consuming. In order to reduce annotation costs, we present a weakly supervised instance segmentation method in this article. A deeply convolutional network is first used to construct multi-scale feature maps for each object in the input image. After that, the encoder-decoder framework with dynamic convolution is utilised to enhance model capacity and efficiency, while avoiding the issues of anchor design, proposal selection, and RoIAlign implementation. In particular, Dynamic Heads are used in the encoder to create dynamic convolution kernels, while Instance Heads are used in the decoder to provide the global feature map. With dynamic convolution, each instance can be segmented independently, reducing interference with other instances and improving segmentation accuracy. Under the supervision of projection loss and pixel point colour pairing loss, the contours of each object are finally outlined. On the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, the proposed method is competitive with more sophisticated approaches. In the VOC dataset, segmentation performance achieved 37.6% average precision with ResNet-101 and FPN networks. The extensively visualised results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed encoder-decoder framework with dynamic convolution.

J	Zhu, Y				Zhu, Yan			'Big brothers and sisters have my back': Benefits and risks of befriending older peers as a strategy to deal with school bullying	CHILD ABUSE REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						bullying; cross-age peer relationship; power; protection	INTERVENTION; STUDENTS; BEHAVIOR; VICTIMS; SUPPORT; CHINA; AGE	Befriending 'brothers' and 'sisters' from older year groups was a strategy used by children to gain protection against being bullied by same-age peers at school, especially in contexts, such as Chinese rural boarding schools, where children spend a long time with peers under limited adult supervision. However, it is alarming that such close connections with older children, in some cases, could give children a feeling of having power over their same-age peers, leading them to engage in bullying. In addition, since the roles as the provider and receiver of protection could cause an unbalanced power between the older ones and younger ones, younger children might have to experience a 'dark' side of such cross-age peer relationships, such as exploitation, in some cases. Such experiences could be further strengthened by the Chinese values of 'giving' and 'gaining' in relationships. Therefore, based on an ethnographic study in a rural primary boarding school in China, this article argues that befriending older peers could contribute to increasing the safety of children at school. However, it is also necessary to be aware of potential risks associated with such peer relationships, because of the unbalanced power relation amongst children caused by age.

Timely diagnosis and proper management by a multidisciplinary team can lead to a favorable outcome. Sex assignment should be deferred until puberty because spontaneous virilization occurs and the patient can engage in the decision-making process. 5-Alpha reductase deficiency is a genetic disorder causing 46, XY disorder of sex development (DSD). Typical clinical feature is a male with ambiguous genitalia or undervirilization at birth. Here we report three cases of this disorder within a family.

Decapod crustaceans make up a large part of this associated fauna on coral reefs. Among these, cryptochirid crabs are obligately associated with scleractinian corals, in which they create dwellings where they permanently reside. These gall crabs show various levels of host specificity, with the majority of cryptochirids inhabiting a specific coral genus or species. Here, we report the first records of gall crabs living in association with two different Porites species in the Red Sea. Crescent-shaped dwellings were observed in Porites rus and a Porites sp. in situ, and colonies with crabs were collected for further study in the laboratory. Using a combination of morphology and DNA barcoding, the crabs were identified as belonging to Opecarcinus, a genus only known to inhabit Agariciidae corals. The coral skeleton was bleached and studied under a stereo microscope, which revealed that the Porites corals overgrew adjoining agariciid Pavona colonies. We hypothesize that the gall crab originally settled on Pavona, its primary host of choice. Due to coral interspecific competition the Porites colony overgrew the adjacent Pavona colonies, resulting in a secondary and never before reported association of Opecarcinus with Porites. These findings suggest that cryptochirid crabs can adapt to the new microenvironment provided by a different coral host and survive competition for space on coral reefs.

Study designCross-sectional retrospective study. AnimalsA total of 306 (n = 242 dogs) TECA-LBOs (extreme brachycephalic breeds [EBB] = 81, other breeds [OB] = 225). MethodsMedical records of patients undergoing TECA-LBO at a single referral institution (2010-2022) were evaluated. ResultsExtreme brachycephalic breeds most commonly presented acutely, at a younger age with oto-neurological signs (46/81, 56.8%). Chronic otitis externa without neurological signs (171/225, 76.0%) was most common in OBs. Extreme brachycephalic breeds preoperatively presented more frequently with facial nerve paresis (p = .001), vestibular syndrome (p = .001), and Horner's syndrome (p = .002) compared to OBs. On diagnostic imaging, bilateral changes (p = .038), aural masses (p = .045), para-aural abscesses (p = .011), otitis interna (p = .001), and brainstem changes (p = .001) were more common in EBBs. The apparent difference in intraoperative complication rate between EBBs (9/81, 11.1%) and OBs (12/225, 5.3%) did not reach statistical significance (p = .078). Perioperative complications occurred in 85/306 (27.8%) of TECA-LBOs with no difference in perioperative complication rate between EBBs (19/81, 23.5%) and OBs (66/225, 29.3%) (p = .586). ConclusionExtreme brachycephalic breeds are more likely to present for TECA-LBO acutely, with neurological signs and more advanced diagnostic imaging abnormalities. Intra- and perioperative complication rates did not differ between EBBs and OBs. Clinical significanceDespite being subjectively more technically challenging, TECA-LBO did not result in more surgical complications in EBBs. Reported data are useful for effectively informing clients of the specific risks of TECA-LBO surgery.

J	Bickel, DR				Bickel, David R.			Statistical evidence and surprise unified under possibility theory	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Editorial Material; Early Access							LIKELIHOOD	Sander Greenland argues that reported results of hypothesis tests should include the surprisal, the base-2 logarithm of the reciprocal of a p-value. The surprisal measures how many bits of evidence in the data warrant rejecting the null hypothesis. A generalization of surprisal also can measure how much the evidence justifies rejecting a composite hypothesis such as the complement of a confidence interval. That extended surprisal, called surprise, quantifies how many bits of astonishment an agent believing a hypothesis would experience upon observing the data. While surprisal is a function of a point in hypothesis space, surprise is a function of a subset of hypothesis space. Satisfying the conditions of conditional min-plus probability, surprise inherits a wealth of tools from possibility theory. The equivalent compatibility function has been recently applied to the replication crisis, to adjusting p-values for prior information, and to comparing scientific theories.

Application of habitat association models across regions: Useful explanatory power retained in wetland bird case study	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						distribution; Great Lakes region; habitat association; model transferability; Prairie Pothole Region; remotely sensed data; wetland birds	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; PRAIRIE POTHOLE REGION; LAND-USE CHANGE; OCCUPANCY DYNAMICS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE; NORTH-DAKOTA; GREAT; LANDSCAPE; CONSERVATION; AREA	Species often exhibit regionally specific habitat associations, so habitat association models developed in one region might not be accurate or even appropriate for other regions. Three programs to survey wetland-breeding birds covering (respectively) Great Lakes coastal wetlands, inland Great Lakes wetlands, and the Prairie Pothole Region offer an opportunity to test whether regionally specific models of habitat use by wetland-obligate breeding birds are transferrable across regions. We first developed independent, regional population density models for four species of wetland-obligate birds: Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), Sora (Porzana carolina), and American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus). We then used adjusted pseudo-R-2 values to compare the amount of variation explained by each model when applied to data collected in each of the three regions. Although certain habitat characteristics, such as emergent vegetation and wetland area, were consistently important across regions, models for each species differed by region-both in variables selected for inclusion and often in the directionality of relationships for common variables-indicating that habitat associations for these species are regionally specific. When we applied a model developed in one region to data collected in another region, we found that explanatory power was reduced in most (71%) models. Therefore, we suggest that ecological analyses should emphasize regionally specific habitat association models whenever possible. Nonetheless, models created from inland Great Lakes wetland data had higher median explanatory power when applied to other regions, and the amount of explanatory power lost by other transferred models was relatively small. Thus, while regionally specific habitat association models are preferable, in the absence of reliable regional data, habitat association models developed in one region may be applied to another region, but the results need to be cautiously interpreted. Additionally, we found that median explanatory power was higher when local-scale habitat characteristics were included in the models, indicating that regionally specific models should ideally be based on a combination of local- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics.

The process was carried out by combining the atom transfer radical polymerization of styrene with the ring-opening polymerization of e-caprolactone from polymeric linoleic acid having hydroxyl groups and bromine groups in the main chain. The characterization of the products was achieved using proton nuclear magnetic resonance, size-exclusion chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. Subsequently, an organic field effect transistor (OFET) was fabricated with PLina-g-PSt-g-PCL graft copolymers as the insulator layer. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was used as the active layer and prepatterned OFET substrates were used as the welding/discharge electrodes. To measure capacitance, an ITO/P3HT/PLina-g-PSt-g-PCL/Al structure was prepared using the same method. To obtain output and transfer current-voltage characteristics, electrical characterizations of OFET devices were conducted in darkness and an atmosphere of air. From a capacitance-frequency plot, the key characteristics of the devices, including the threshold voltage (V-Th), field effect mobility, and current on/off ratio (I-on/off), were derived. The fundamental electrical parameters in the fabricated OFET devices based on styrene concentration were thoroughly examined. It was observed that the produced PLina-g-PSt-g-PCL OFETs display positive device characteristics such as low V-Th, exceptional mobility, and I-on/off values. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Late-gestation prediction of outcome in tricuspid valve dysplasia and Ebstein's anomaly using fetal tricuspid regurgitation waveform analysis	ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						dP; dt; Ebstein's anomaly; fetal echocardiography; tricuspid regurgitation waveform; tricuspid valve dysplasia	PERINATAL-MORTALITY; RELIABILITY; FETUSES	ObjectiveTo investigate the criteria, based on fetal TR waveforms in late gestation, to predict biventricular circulation (BV) after birth in cases of tricuspid valve dysplasia (TVD) or Ebstein's anomaly diagnosed during the fetal period. MethodsWe included 35 consecutive cases diagnosed with TVD or Ebstein's anomaly during the fetal period between January 2008 and December 2021 at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Kanagawa, Japan. The maximum velocity and change in pressure over time of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet (dP/dt), estimated using TR waveforms obtained during the late-gestation period (gestational age >= 28 weeks), were collected from patient records. dP/dt was calculated by dividing the change in estimated right ventricular pressure obtained using Bernoulli's principle by the time taken for the TR maximum velocity to change from one-third to two-thirds of its peak value. The outcome was divided into four categories: BV, single ventricular circulation, neonatal death and fetal death. Patients with BV were included in the BV group, while patients with single ventricular circulation, neonatal death or fetal death were included in the non-BV (NBV) group. ResultsOverall, 19 and 16 patients were included in the BV and NBV groups, respectively. The median TR maximum velocity was 3.3 (range, 2.4-3.6) m/s in the BV group and 1.9 (range, 1.0-3.3) m/s in the NBV group. There were no cases of postnatal BV in fetuses with TR maximum velocity < 2.4 m/s; cases with TR maximum velocity of 2.4-3.3 m/s were observed in both BV and NBV groups. Receiver-operating-characteristics-curve analysis was performed on the 11 patients in the BV group and five patients in the NBV group with a TR maximum velocity of 2.4-3.3 m/s. dP/dt >= 350 mmHg/s and TR maximum velocity >= 2.9 m/s were identified as criteria for predicting the outcome in such cases. The performance of dP/dt >= 350 mmHg/s in predicting BV after birth in fetuses with TVD or Ebstein's anomaly was higher compared to that of TR maximum velocity >= 2.9 m/s (sensitivity, 90.9% vs 72.3% and specificity, 80.0% vs 80.0%, respectively). ConclusionsIn fetuses with TVD or Ebstein's anomaly, the postnatal outcome may be BV or NBV when the TR maximum velocity is 2.4-3.3 m/s. In such cases, by combining the TR maximum velocity with dP/dt >= 350 mmHg/s, BV after birth may be predicted with greater accuracy.

Temporal validation of the Australian estimated post-transplant survival score	NEPHROLOGY			English	Article						Australia; calibration; clinical epidemiology; transplantation; validation study	DECEASED DONOR KIDNEYS; ALLOCATION; TRANSPLANTATION; DIALYSIS; UTILITY	Aims The Australian estimated post-transplant survival (EPTS-AU) prediction score was developed by re-fitting the United States of America EPTS, without diabetes, to the Australian and New Zealand kidney transplant population over 2002-2013. The EPTS-AU score incorporates age, previous transplantation and time on dialysis. Diabetes was excluded from the score, as this was not previously recorded in the Australian allocation system. In May 2021, the EPTS-AU prediction score was incorporated into the Australian kidney allocation algorithm to optimize utility for recipients (maximized benefit). We aimed to temporally validate the EPTS-AU prediction score to ensure it can be used for this purpose.Methods Using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry, we included adult recipients of deceased donor kidney-only transplants between 2014 and 2021. We constructed Cox models for patient survival. We assessed validation using measures of model fit (Akaike information criterion and misspecification), discrimination (Harrell's C statistic and Kaplan-Meier curves), and calibration (observed vs. predicted survival).Results Six thousand four hundred and two recipients were included in the analysis. The EPTS-AU had moderate discrimination with a C statistic of 0.69 (95% CI 0.67, 0.71), and clear delineation between Kaplan-Meier's survival curves of EPTS-AU. The EPTS was well calibrated with the predicted survivals equating with the observed survival outcomes for all prognostic groups.Conclusions The EPTS-AU performs reasonably well in choosing between recipients (discrimination) and to predict a recipient's survival (calibration). Reassuringly, the score is functioning as intended to predict post-transplant survival for recipients as part of the national allocation algorithm.	[Irish, G.

Herein, we report a facile method for chirality sensing of monoalcohols, a challenging target due to the poor reactivity, by combining dynamic covalent chemistry with helical chirality. Four diphenylethene (DPE) derived cyclic hemiaminals were constructed, and the incorporation of a broad range of alcohols and thiols with high efficiency was achieved. The reversibility was further verified by dynamic component exchange. The helical chirality of the DPE motif was induced through chirality transfer by the central chirality of the analytes, resulting in circular dichroism responses. The chirality differentiation of seven chiral secondary alcohols including both alkyl and aryl alcohols was realized, further allowing the quantification of enantiomeric excess with high accuracy. The results described should lay a foundation for future endeavors in chemical sensing, asymmetric synthesis, and chiroptical materials.

Ion doping has been demonstrated as one powerful method for improving the optical properties of CsPbX3 NCs. However, the conventional ion-doping approaches are tedious, and generally performed under an inert atmosphere and high temperature. In this work, a one-step ultrasonic-assisted approach is demonstrated to prepare doped CsPbX3 NCs. To demonstrate the universality of the ultrasonic-assisted ion-doping approach, three ion-doped perovskite NCs are prepared, which represent three common improvements effects of ion doping on perovskite NCs, namely improved stability, PL emission, and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of perovskite NCs. Sr-doped CsPbI3 NCs showed improved phase stability. Mn-doped CsPbCl3 NCs showed dual-color emissions at 406 and 580 nm. The PLQYs of the as-prepared Ni-doped CsPbCl3 NCs are greatly improved, from 10.1% to 71%. Such a simple and versatile ion-doping approach may promote the practical applications of all-inorganic perovskite NCs.

The paper asks what the spelling of charters tells us about administrative and socio-cultural changes in charter production and in scribal education. The research data is 997 charters from the Late Latin Charter Treebank, and the approach that of philological corpus linguistics.

J	Kuzmany, B				Kuzmany, Boerries			Objectivising national identity: The introduction of national registers in the late Habsburg Empire	NATIONS AND NATIONALISM			English	Article						consociationalism; Eastern Europe; elections; Habsburg empire; individual versus group rights; language; national identity; nationalities law; non-territorial autonomy	HUMAN-RIGHTS	Western societies over the last few decades have seen an increased interest in questions of group belonging and group identities, including ethno-national groups. According to essentialising or constructivist paradigms, belonging to a national group is commonly conceptualised in the range of objective versus subjective criteria, where objective entails ascription and subjective, self-identification. This paper suggests disentangling the paired dimensions-objective and other-classification versus subjective and self-classification-by analysing the late Habsburg Empire. I argue that the introduction of national registers in the new provincial constitutions and electoral laws of Moravia, Bukovina and Galicia accelerated an objective understanding of nationality and increasingly favoured other-classification over self-classification in cases where national belonging had become an administrative category. Yet, to do justice to the individual's subjective feelings, authorities were supposed to investigate objectively a citizen's subjective identification-a procedure that can be termed "objectivisation." Such objectivising procedures thus reconciled an individual's subjective identification with an increasingly objective understanding of nationality by developing guidelines on how classification by others should proceed.

SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Editorial Material; Early Access								Greenland (2023) distinguishes between P-values used for data description and P-values used for declaring significance. That's a useful distinction and Greenland has advanced our field by making it. That distinction comes with the idea that describing data with statistical models is often a useful task for statisticians. Again, we agree. Along the way, Greenland also says (i) there is such a thing as a "measure horizontal ellipsis of evidence [from data] against a statistical hypothesis or model" without regard to alternatives; (ii) "a discrepancy P-value is an ordinal description horizontal ellipsis "; (iii) descriptive "P-values can be derived to provide coherent measures of refutational evidence"; and a few other things that deserve comment and discussion.

Mesoporous carbon is now among the most attractive substances due to its enormous specific surface area, high porosity, and structured pore structure. There are many methods to synthesize mesoporous carbon, among which the template method is widely used because of the variety of templates and synthesis pathways. Mesoporous carbon has been used in many fields. Its good electrical conductivity, lightweight nature, and low price have led to many applications in electrochemistry, such as capacitors, electrodes, and materials for electric vehicles. This work contains a literature overview on the synthesis methods and modification techniques for mesoporous carbon, as well as its application in electrochemistry, which serves as a guide for the future growth of mesoporous carbon research.

Ecomorphological patterns in trigeminal canal branching among sauropsids reveal sensory shift in suchians	JOURNAL OF ANATOMY			English	Article						crocodyliforms; ecomorphology; somatosensation; trigeminal	OSTRICH STRUTHIO-CAMELUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY; VISUAL-FIELDS; INNER-EAR; BILL TIP; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; ORIGIN; NERVE	The vertebrate trigeminal nerve is the primary mediator of somatosensory information from nerve endings across the face, extending nerve branches through bony canals in the face and mandibles, terminating in sensory receptors. Reptiles evolved several extreme forms of cranial somatosensation in which enhanced trigeminal tissues are present in species engaging in unique mechanosensory behaviors. However, morphology varies by clade and ecology among reptiles. Few lineages approach the extreme degree of tactile somatosensation possessed by crocodylians, the only remaining members of a clade that underwent an ecological transition from the terrestrial to semiaquatic habitat, also evolving a specialized trigeminal system. It remains to be understood how trigeminal osteological correlates inform how adaptations for enhanced cranial sensation evolved in crocodylians. Here we identify an increase in sensory abilities in Early Jurassic crocodylomorphs, preceding the transitions to a semiaquatic habitat. Through quantification of trigeminal neurovascular canal branching patterns in an extant phylogenetic bracket we quantify and identify morphologies associated with sensory behaviors in representative fossil taxa, we find stepwise progression of increasing neurovascular canal density, complexity, and distribution from the primitive archosaurian to the derived crocodilian condition. Model-based inferences of sensory ecologies tested on quantified morphologies of extant taxa with known sensory behaviors indicate a parallel increase in sensory abilities among pseudosuchians. These findings establish patterns of reptile trigeminal ecomorphology, revealing evolutionary patterns of somatosensory ecology.	[Lessner, Emily J. J.; Holliday, Casey M.

Ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring in the distal regions of the flap is a common issue, which often leads to flap necrosis and restricts its clinical applications. Procyanidin B2 (PB2), a naturally occurring flavonoid in large quantities in various fruits, has been demonstrated to exhibit several significant pharmacological properties. However, the effect of PB2 on flap viability is not clearly known. Here, using Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining, we observed that PB2 significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and enhanced angiogenesis. Mechanically, we provided evidence for the first time that the beneficial effects of PB2 occur through the activation of the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, co-administration of PB2 and EX527, a selective inhibitor of Sirt1, resulted in down-regulation of the expression of Sirt1, Nrf2, and downstream antioxidants. In summary, our study showed that PB2 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the survival of random-pattern skin flaps.

Epidemiology plays a key role in cancer prevention and control by describing the distribution of cancer and discovering risk factors for cancer. Large pediatric research consortium trials have led to a clearer understanding of pediatric renal tumors, identification of risk factors, and development of more risk-adapted therapies. These therapies have improved event-free and overall survival for children. However, several challenges remain and not all children have benefited from the improved outcomes. In this article, we review the global epidemiology of pediatric renal tumors, including key consortium and global studies. We identify current knowledge gaps and challenges facing both high and low middle-incomes countries.

However, the identity of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, PVNVGlut2::MC4R and LCVGlut2::MC4R regulation of body weight, and axonal projections of LCVGlut2 neurons remain unclear. Conditional knockout of MC4R in chimeric mice was used to confirm the effects of VGlut2. Interscapular brown adipose tissue was injected with pseudorabies virus to study the central nervous system projections. We mapped the LCVGlut2 circuitry. Based on the Cre-LoxP recombination system, specific knockdown of MC4R in VGlut2 neurons resulted in weight gain in chimeric mice. Adeno-associated virus-mediated knockdown of MC4R expression in the PVN and LC had potential superimposed effects on weight gain, demonstrating the importance of VGlut2 neurons. Unlike these wide-ranging efferent projections, the PVN, hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, supraoptic nucleus of the lateral olfactory tegmental nuclei, and nucleus tractus solitarius send excitatory projections to LCVGlut2 neurons. The PVN ?LC glutamatergic MC4R long-term neural circuit positively affected weight management and could help treat obesity.

Salsola ferganica Drob. is one of the most abundant plants in desert regions and thrives in extreme environments with multiple but limited water resources, including dew and fog; however, its mechanisms of water harvesting remain unclear. We investigated trichome structural characteristics and their influence on the surface wettability of S. ferganica leaves using a variety of approaches (scanning electron microscopy, optical microscopy, immunolabelling staining, x-ray diffractometry, and infrared spectroscopy). Microstructural observations revealed that the trichomes of S. ferganica presented a curved upper part, the 'spindle node'-like structure in the middle, and the micro-grooves structure in between; such unique structures may aid in capturing moisture from the air. The physicochemical characteristics of the trichome surface, including hydrophobic functional groups, hydrophilic pectins, and low crystallinity, may enhance the adhesion of water drops to trichomes. Furthermore, we discovered that the piliferous S. ferganica leaves were more effective in retaining water than the glabrous S. aralocaspica leaves, and the dense trichome layer exhibited a significantly unwettable surface (high contact angle with droplets), whereas the individual trichomes retained water effectively (more so under drought conditions). The combination of these two properties is consistent with the 'rose petal effect', which describes rough surfaces that are hydrophobic but exhibit high adhesion with water. These factors suggest that the evolutionary optimisation of water acquisition by coupling relevant microstructures with the physicochemical properties of trichomes enables S. ferganica to survive harsh conditions in the seedling stage.

Downregulation of INa, as occurs in Brugada syndrome (BrS), causes ventricular arrhythmias. The present study investigated whether the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates Na(v)1.5 in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). In healthy male and female iPSC-CMs, activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by CHIR-99021 reduced (p < 0.01) both Na(v)1.5 protein and SCN5A mRNA. In iPSC-CMs from a BrS patient, both Na(v)1.5 protein and peak INa were reduced compared to those in healthy iPSC-CMs. Treatment of BrS iPSC-CMs with Wnt-C59, a small-molecule Wnt inhibitor, led to a 2.1-fold increase in Na(v)1.5 protein (p = 0.0005) but surprisingly did not affect SCN5A mRNA (p = 0.146). Similarly, inhibition of Wnt signaling using shRNA-mediated beta-catenin knockdown in BrS iPSC-CMs led to a 4.0-fold increase in Na(v)1.5, which was associated with a 4.9-fold increase in peak INa but only a 2.1-fold increase in SCN5A mRNA. The up regulation of Na(v)1.5 by beta-catenin knockdown was verified in iPSC-CMs from a second BrS patient. This study demonstrated that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibits Na(v)1.5 expression in both male and female human iPSC-CMs, and inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling upregulates Na(v)1.5 in BrS iPSC-CMs through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms.

Nutrition is fundamental in its dispersion and the key to its success. This is the main reason why knowledge of their nutritional preferences/requirements could play a fundamental role in rabbit biology and, therefore, in their conservation. The objectives of the work will be to elucidate how age and sex affect both nutritional preferences/requirements, and the nutrient optimisation of European rabbits. To address this gap, 70 wild European rabbits were studied. The rabbits were divided according to their age: adult (n = 43) and young (n = 27). Two groups were differentiated according to the adult rabbits' sex: females (n = 28) and males (n = 15). We analysed the relative (%) and absolute (g) chemical composition of the rabbits' gastric contents: dry matter (DM), ashes (ASH), crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), and lignin, hemicelluloses and celluloses, highly digestible nonnitrogenous nutrients (HDNN: fat, starch, and soluble fibre), well from the blood was analysed with plasmatic urea nitrogen (PUN), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) and glucose (GLU). As a nutrient optimisation measure, the following indices between blood metabolites and stomach content were calculated: PUN/CP total content, NEFA/DM total content and GLU/DM total content ratios. Our works showed that age and sex affected the nutritional strategy of rabbits. Regarding age: adults showed lower CP (-14%; p = 0.0217) and higher HDNN (+21%; p = 0.0399) relative content than young rabbits, and absolute amount of most nutrients: DM (+59%; p = 0.001), OM (+43%; p = 0.0049), ASH (+54%; p = 0.0085), Hemicelluloses (+73%; p = 0.0084), Cellulose (+27%; p = 0.0452), and HDNN (+63%; p = 0.0012). In addition, adults showed better nutrient optimisation. Sex did not affect the relative chemical composition of the gastric content, but it showed a clear higher gastric content by females (+85%; p < 0.0001) and higher intake of most of the absolute chemical components: DM (+64%; p < 0.001), CP (+56%; p = 0.0005), OM (+58%; p = 0.0001), ASH (+44%; p = 0.0123), HDNN (+39%; p = 0.001), NDF (+59%; p = 0.001), ADF (+64%; p = 0.0003), lignin (+82%; p = 0.0036) and cellulose (+58%; p = 0.0002). Finally, we observed that females had better nutrient optimisation than males. This works supports the idea that feeding ecology and nutrition are particularly relevant to reproductive success and fitness in wild animals.

W.; Reza, Syed Walid			Private benefits of corporate philanthropy and distortions to corporate financing and investment decisions	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW			English	Article						corporate giving; corporate governance; private benefits of control; investment decisions; financing decisions; hedge fund activism	FREE CASH FLOW; SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; AGENCY PROBLEMS; CONSTRAINTS; GOVERNANCE; EQUITY; FIRM; OWNERSHIP; COSTS; COMPENSATION	Research Question/IssueThis study examines whether private benefits of control, as measured by corporate philanthropic activities, distort corporate financing and investment decisions. Research Findings/InsightsWe find that corporate giving represents a private benefit of control that distorts corporate investment and financing activity, consistent with free cash flow agency theory. Corporate giving discourages managers from pursuing external financing, especially debt issuance, to minimize outside monitoring. It creates preferences for internally financed cash acquisitions for the same reason. These distortions reduce shareholder wealth. Following both the 2003 dividend tax cut and hedge fund activism, corporate charitable contributions fall while investment rises, suggesting suboptimal investment caused by managerial private benefit extraction. Acquisition announcements of firms making large charitable contributions show negative stock market reactions that are more pronounced for acquirers with poor corporate governance. Theoretical/Academic ImplicationsOur findings suggest that due to agency problems and managerial rent extraction, corporate philanthropic activities can distort corporate financing and investment decisions and yield corporate charitable contribution allocations that personally benefit a firm's CEO at shareholder expense. Practitioner/Policy ImplicationsAs corporate philanthropy imposes a significant cost to shareholders, managers may seek shareholder approval on corporate philanthropic activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission may also require timely disclosure of corporate donations.	[Masulis, Ronald W.
