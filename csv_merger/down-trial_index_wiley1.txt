J	Berg, E				Berg, Emily			Small area prediction of seat-belt use rates using a Bayesian hierarchical unit-level Poisson model with multivariate random effects	STAT			English	Article						count data; multivariate; survey sampling	INDICATORS; POVERTY	The Iowa Seat-Belt Use Survey is an annual survey designed to provide estimates of seat-belt use rates for the state of Iowa in the United States. A desire for county level (substate) estimates motivates the need for small area estimation. Developing a small area model for the seat-belt survey data is challenging for two mean reasons. First, the data consist of multivariate counts. Second, the same sampling units are observed for five different time points. An appropriate model should reflect multivariate dependencies and the longitudinal data structure. We address these challenges though a unit-level Bayesian hierarchical model. The observed counts have Poisson distributions. Latent random effects capture multivariate associations and correlations among the observations for the same sampling unit observed at different time points. We employ the posterior predictive distribution for model comparisons. Using the selected model, we construct small area predictors of two measures of seat-belt use at the county level for 5 years.

However, households depending on unregulated water systems like wells and springs, which are less routinely tested, may be unaware of their water quality. Access to easy-to-comprehend water quality information may be challenging. Therefore, this study utilized multiple water quality parameters to determine karst spring water quality using two water quality index (WQI) methods. This approach aggregates and summarizes water quality data into a single value or index characterizing the general health status of water at a given location in an easy-to-understand way. In situ measurements of physicochemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, specific conductance, total dissolved solids, and oxidation-reduction potential) were taken at 50 karst springs in east Tennessee during summer 2021. Water samples were analyzed for microbial (fecal coliform and Escherichia coli), nutrients (nitrate and nitrite), and radiological (radon) constituents using standard analytical methods. WQI method 1 (Brown et al. Water Quality Index) rated 12% of springs as "very poor" water quality and 88% as "unfit for drinking." WQI method 2 (National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index) rated 4% of the sampled springs as "good," 92% as "moderate," and 4% as "bad." Given the prevalence of fecal contamination in the sampled springs, even springs rated good should be properly treated before consumption. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate WQI for the end water use, and for water quality information that is easily understandable by water users. Fifty springs were sampled and water quality was assessed using two indices (Brown et al. Water Quality Index and National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index).Indices were adapted to incorporate physicochemical, microbial, and radiological parameters.BWQI-based assessment showed 12% of the springs to be "very poor" in quality, and 88% to be "unfit for drinking."NSFWQI evaluation showed 4% of springs were rated "good," 92% "medium," and 4% "bad."Indices did not always agree and springs rated good using NSFWQI contained pathogens, a weakness of NSFWQI.

J	Thiele, LS; Peters, D				Thiele, Laura Sophie; Peters, Diana			Digitalisation and inter-organisational information exchange strategies of German companies-A survey with focus on small and medium sized enterprises	IET COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						computer integrated manufacturing; manufacturing industries	INDUSTRY 4.0	The reliability of well-performing production processes not only depends on internal but also on external factors in the upstream supply chain. Therefore, companies require fast and reliable information exchange with cooperating organisations. Since existing researches usually put focus on reviewing intra-organisational solutions, the authors have conducted a survey to capture the current state and needs regarding the inter-organisational information exchange between German companies. The main outcomes of the authors' survey are outlined. In a first step, the current status of digitalisation in the companies is analysed. The authors have found that the use and implementation of modern methods correlates positively with the company size. Taking a look on the current methods for inter-organisational information exchange in a second step, it is seen that only a few companies are completely satisfied with their current methods. Companies see the greatest potential for the improvement of information exchange in standardisation and the increase of required resources. This indicates that companies would be best supported by the development of solutions that can be implemented easily and help to form the heterogeneous landscape of data exchange strategies towards a structured, standardised way. The results of the authors' study on digitisation and inter-organisational information exchange strategies of German SME is published. The current status of the companies is shown and potential for improvements is identified.image	[Thiele, Laura Sophie; Peters, Diana] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Data Sci, Jena, Germany	Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR)	Thiele, LS (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Data Sci, Jena, Germany.	laura.thiele@dlr.de			We thank the Helmholtz Association (HGF) for funding our exploratory study.

However, there is little work on model averaging methods under generalized semiparametric models. In this article, we study model averaging in generalized partially linear varying-coefficient models and propose a semiparametric model averaging estimation (SMAE) method for the canonical parameters. Specifically, we take the partially linear varying-coefficient model as candidate models in which there is only one varying-coefficient component. The different covariates could enjoy the benefit of matching the optimal degrees of freedom and each candidate model can take into account the confounding effects among predictors as well. Moreover, the weight choice criterion based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence is adopted to determine the weights. We prove that the corresponding model averaging estimator is asymptotically optimal under certain regularity conditions. Finally, some simulation studies and a real data analysis are conducted to compare with existing methods, and the results show that the proposed method has better out-of-sample performance.

Environmental enrichment initiated in adolescence restores the reduced expression of synaptophysin and GFAP in the hippocampus of chronically stressed rats in a sex-specific manner	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						astrocytes; chronic unpredictable stress; hippocampus; plasticity; sex differences; synapses	DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIORS; UNPREDICTABLE MILD STRESS; MATERNAL-DEPRIVATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ANIMAL-MODELS; CB1 RECEPTORS; ASTROCYTES; EXPOSURE; ANXIETY; SYSTEM	This study aims at investigating whether environmental enrichment (EE) initiated in adolescence can alter chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-associated changes in astroglial and synaptic plasticity markers in male and female rats. To this end, we studied possible alterations in hippocampal glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and synaptophysin (SYN) in CUS rats previously housed in EE. Wistar rats on postnatal day (PND) 23 were housed for 10 weeks in standard housing (SH) or enriched conditions. On PND 66, animals were exposed to CUS for 4 weeks. SYN and GFAP expressions were evaluated in CA1 and CA3 subfields and dentate gyrus (DG). CUS reduced the expression of SYN in all hippocampal areas, whereas lower GFAP expression was evident only in CA1 and CA3. The reduced expression of SYN in DG and CA3 was evident to male SH/CUS rats, whereas the reduced GFAP expression in CA1 and CA3 was limited to SH/CUS females. EE housing increased the hippocampal expression of both markers and protected against CUS-associated decreases. Our findings indicate that the decreases in the expression of SYN and GFAP following CUS are region and sex-specific and underline the neuroprotective role of EE against these CUS-associated changes.

The roles of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in human myotubes are dependent on donor patho-physiological background	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						diacylglycerol acyltransferases; fatty acid oxidation; insulin resistance; lipogenesis; muscle lipid; triacylglycerols	FATTY-ACID OXIDATION; MUSCLE LIPID-CONTENT; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; TRIGLYCERIDE SYNTHESIS; TRIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHESIS; GLUCOSE; LOCALIZATION; SENSITIVITY; SECRETION	The roles of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in lipid metabolism and insulin responsiveness of human skeletal muscle were studied using cryosections and myotubes prepared from muscle biopsies from control, athlete, and impaired glucose regulation (IGR) cohorts of men. The previously observed increases in intramuscular triacylglycerol (IMTG) in athletes and IGR were shown to be related to an increase in lipid droplet (LD) area in type I fibers in athletes but, conversely, in type II fibers in IGR subjects. Specific inhibition of both diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 1 and 2 decreased fatty acid (FA) uptake by myotubes, whereas only DGAT2 inhibition also decreased fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid uptake in myotubes was negatively correlated with the lactate thresholds of the respective donors. DGAT2 inhibition lowered acetate uptake and oxidation in myotubes from all cohorts whereas DGAT1 inhibition had no effect. A positive correlation between acetate oxidation in myotubes and resting metabolic rate (RMR) from fatty acid oxidation in vivo was observed. Myotubes from athletes and IGR had higher rates of de novo lipogenesis from acetate that were normalized by DGAT2 inhibition. Moreover, DGAT2 inhibition in myotubes also resulted in increased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation. The differential effects of DGAT1 and DGAT2 inhibition suggest that the specialized role of DGAT2 in esterifying nascent diacylglycerols and de novo synthesized FA is associated with synthesis of a pool of triacylglycerol, which upon hydrolysis results in effectors that promote mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation but decrease insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells.

Complex consequences of disturbance on canopy plant communities of world forests: a review and synthesis	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Review; Early Access						canopy; conservation; disturbance; diversity; epiphyte; forestry; fragmentation	VASCULAR EPIPHYTES; CLOUD-FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MONTANE FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; CACAO PLANTATIONS; ANDEAN LANDSCAPE; MOSS HARVEST; DIVERSITY; BRYOPHYTES	Epiphytes and their associated biota are increasingly recognized as contributing to biodiversity and to filling critical ecosystem functions in world forests. However, the attributes that have made them successful in canopy environments also make them vulnerable to natural and human-induced disturbances. Drawing upon ecological frameworks to understand disturbance, I categorized and synthesized the drivers and the consequences of disturbances on epiphytic materials. Across all impacts, disturbance agents were significantly more likely to lead to negative, rather than positive, effects in both tropical and temperate locales. Significantly more studies reported negative effects on abundance, diversity, community composition and connectivity, but some studies showed that disturbances enhanced these attributes. Although particular disturbance agents did not differently influence individual consequences, they explained a significant portion of variation in aggregated totals. Surprisingly, relative to human disturbances, natural disturbances were more likely to lead to negative effects. Many studies provided recommendations for effective societal responses to mitigate negative impacts, such as retaining large, old trees in forestry operations, patch-clearing for epiphyte harvest, maximizing forest fragment size, using epiphytes as bioindicators of disturbance, and applying principles of community forestry to land management. Future actions should also include communication of these results to policymakers and land managers.

Body size and trophic position determine the outcomes of species invasions along temperature and productivity gradients	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						body size; diversity-stability relationship; eutrophication; metabolic ecology; predator-prey mass ratio; species invasions; trophic modules; warming	CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS; COEXISTENCE; ECOSYSTEMS	Species invasions are predicted to increase in frequency with global change, but quantitative predictions of how environmental filters and species traits influence the success and consequences of invasions for local communities are lacking. Here we investigate how invaders alter the structure, diversity and stability regime of simple communities across environmental gradients (habitat productivity, temperature) and community size structure. We simulate all three-species trophic modules (apparent and exploitative competition, trophic chain and intraguild predation). We predict that invasions most often succeed in warm and productive habitats and that successful invaders include smaller competitors, intraguild predators and comparatively small top predators. This suggests that species invasions and global change may facilitate the downsizing of food webs. Furthermore, we show that successful invasions leading to species substitutions rarely alter system stability, while invasions leading to increased diversity can destabilize or stabilize community dynamics depending on the environmental conditions and invader's trophic position. We model species invasions (characterized by varying body mass and trophic positions) in a simple consumer-resource system along environmental gradients of temperature and nutrient levels. Accounting for the structural influences of environmental conditions on resident community prior to invasions, we mapped all invasion-driven changes in diversity, composition and stability regime of the community along environmental gradients for all trophic modules and a wide range of species body mass ratios.image	[Dijoux, Samuel; Boukal, David S.] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Dijoux, Samuel; Boukal, David S.] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Entomol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Pichon, Noemie A.] Univ Oulu, Fac Sci, Ecol & Genet Unit, Oulu, Finland; [Pichon, Noemie A.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Sentis, Arnaud] Aix Marseille Univ, INRAE, UMR RECOVER, Aix En Provence, France	University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of Oulu; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite	Dijoux, S (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Ecosyst Biol, Branisovska 1760, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.	dijoux.samuel@gmail.com	Boukal, David/H-4762-2014; Dijoux, Samuel/AAI-4566-2021	Boukal, David/0000-0001-8181-7458; Pichon, Noemie/0000-0003-2972-1912; Dijoux, Samuel/0000-0002-8086-7696	We thank Ursula Gaedke, Sebastian Diehl and three anonymous reviewers for detailed comments that helped us improve the manuscript.

The method was tested on a phantom and on a healthy rat, as well as on rats in a small myocardium-remodeling study.ResultsThe results showed a good match of the T1 estimates with the results obtained using the ground-truth method on a phantom and with the literature values for rats myocardium. The proposed 2D and 3D methods showed significant differences between normal and remodeling myocardium groups for acquisition lengths down to approximately 5 and 15 min, respectively.ConclusionsA new 2D and 3D method for quantification of myocardial T1 in rats was proposed. We have shown the capability of both techniques to distinguish between normal and remodeling myocardial tissue. We have shown the effects of image-reconstruction regularization weights and acquisition length on the T1 estimates.

Extension of malignant lesions into the renal vein can complicate the scenario.CaseThis report presents a 35-year-old man with primary stage IS NSGCT. Fourteen months after radical orchiectomy he presented with metastasis in the lung, kidney, and para-aortic lymph nodes. He received multiple lines of salvage treatments including chemotherapy and surgery. Intraoperative exploration during radical nephrectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy revealed intra-renal vein involvement with a prominent teratomatous component.ConclusionDefining the exact extent of malignant lesions, especially endovascular lesions, is very important to clarify how advanced the malignant lesions are. The surgeons must be aware of the risk factors that predict vascular involvement, and therefore, providing intraoperative access to vascular surgery procedures when needed.

Sodium closo-carbadodecaborate (NaCB11H12) is an attractive Na-ion conductor owing to its high thermal, electrochemical, and interfacial stability. Mechanical milling has recently been shown to increase conductivity by five orders of magnitude at room temperature, making it appealing for application in all-solid-state sodium batteries. Intriguingly, milling longer than 2 h led to a significant decrease in conductivity. In this study, X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectroscopy is used to probe the origin of the anomalous impact of mechanical treatment on the ionic conductivity of NaCB11H12. The B, C, and Na K-edge XRS spectra are successfully measured for the first time, and ab initio calculations are employed to interpret the results. The experimental and computational results reveal that the decrease in ionic conductivity upon prolonged milling is due to the increased proximity of Na to the CB11H12 cage, caused by severe distortion of the long-range structure. Overall, this work demonstrates how the XRS technique, allowing investigation of low Z elements such as C and B in the bulk, can be used to acquire valuable information on the electronic structure of solid electrolytes and battery materials in general. Mechanochemical milling is a common technique to achieve high ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes. In this work, X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectroscopy reveals that the structural defects introduced by milling are beneficial to the ionic conductivity of sodium closo-carbadodecaborate (NaCB11H12). However, extended milling destroys the structure by increasing the proximity of Na+ to the CB11H12- cage, leading to a profound decrease in the Na-ion conductivity.image	[Gulino, Valerio; de Kort, Laura M.; Rodenburg, Hendrik P.; de Groot, Frank; Ngene, Peter] Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst Nanomat Sci, Mat Chem & Catalysis, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Longo, Alessandro; Sahle, Christoph J.] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Longo, Alessandro] CNR, Ist Studio Materiali Nanostrutturati, I-90146 Palermo, Italy; [Murgia, Fabrizio; Brighi, Matteo; Cerny, Radovan] Univ Geneva, Dept Quantum Matter Phys, Lab Crystallog, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland; [Murgia, Fabrizio] Univ Sassari, Dipartimento Sci Chim Fis Matematiche & Nat, Sassari, Italy; [Sundermann, Martin; Gretarsson, Hlynur] Deutsch Elektronen Synchrotron DESY, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany; [Sundermann, Martin] Max Planck Inst Chem Phys Solids, D-01187 Dresden, Germany	Utrecht University; European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per lo Studio dei Materiali Nanostrutturati (ISMN-CNR); University of Geneva; University of Sassari; Helmholtz Association; Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY); Max Planck Society	Gulino, V; Ngene, P (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst Nanomat Sci, Mat Chem & Catalysis, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands.; Longo, A (corresponding author), European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, F-38000 Grenoble, France.; Longo, A (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Studio Materiali Nanostrutturati, I-90146 Palermo, Italy.	v.gulino@uu.nl; alessandro.longo@esrf.fr; p.ngene@uu.nl		Rodenburg, Henrik/0000-0002-7063-504X; Murgia, Fabrizio/0000-0002-8874-2417; Gretarsson, Hlynur/0009-0008-3209-6736; Alessandro, Longo/0000-0002-8819-2128; Gulino, Valerio/0000-0002-5808-7802; de Kort, Laura/0000-0001-5329-3087	Financial support from The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO-ECHO and NWO-RELEASE) was gratefully acknowledged.

To mitigate these challenges, scientists are relentlessly seeking effective treatment measures. In recent years, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising cell-free therapy strategy, attracting extensive attention from researchers. EVs mediate intercellular communication, possessing excellent biocompatibility and stability. These features make EVs a potential tool for treating a plethora of diseases, including those related to wound repair. However, there is a growing focus on the engineering of EVs to overcome inherent limitations such as low production, relatively fixed content, and targeting capabilities of natural EVs. This engineering could improve both the effectiveness and specificity of EVs in wound repair treatments. In light of this, the present review will introduce the latest progress in the design methods and experimental paradigms of engineered EVs applied in wound repair. Furthermore, it will comprehensively analyze the current clinical research status and prospects of engineered EVs within this field. Extracellular vesicles have gradually become a widely used cell-free therapy strategy due to their excellent biocompatibility, stability, and editability. More and more engineered extracellular vesicles are applied in wound healing. This review summarizes the construction, characterization, cell experiments, and animal experiments of vesicles in the order of experiments involved in vesicle research and introduces these techniques' principles, advantages, and disadvantages.image	[Liao, Yuheng; Zhang, Zhenhe; Ouyang, Lizhi; Mi, Bobin; Liu, Guohui] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Orthoped, 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China	Huazhong University of Science & Technology	Mi, BB; Liu, GH (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Union Hosp, Tongji Med Coll, Dept Orthoped, 1277 Jiefang Ave, Wuhan 430022, Peoples R China.	mibobin@hust.edu.cn; liuguohui@hust.edu.cn			Y.L., Z.Z., and L.O. contributed equally to this work.

Given the unclear health impact of social connectedness for older adults in congregate long-term care settings worldwide, a comprehensive systematic review is required to evaluate the overall relationship between social connectedness and health outcomes for them.ObjectivesThe purpose of this article was to synthesize the literature regarding the health impact of social connectedness among older adults living in nursing homes or assisted living settings.MethodsUsing PRISMA guidelines, we identified eligible studies from Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane databases (1990-2021). Bias and quality reporting assessment was performed using standardized criteria for cohort, cross sectional and qualitative studies. At each stage, >= 2 researchers conducted independent evaluations.ResultsOf the 7350 articles identified, 25 cohort (follow-up range: 1 month-11 years; with two also contributing to cross sectional), 86 cross sectional, eight qualitative and two mixed methods were eligible. Despite different instruments used, many residents living in nursing homes and assisted living settings had reduced social engagement. Quantitative evidence supports a link between higher social engagement and health outcomes most studied (e.g. depression, quality of life). Few studies evaluated important health outcomes (e.g. cognitive and functional decline). Most cohort studies showed that lack of social connectedness accelerated time to death.ConclusionsSocial connectedness may be an important modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes for older adults living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. Most studies were cross sectional and focused on quality of life and mental health outcomes. Longitudinal studies suggest that higher social engagement delays time to death. Evidence regarding other health outcomes important to older adults was scant and requires further longitudinal studies.

Oral methotrexate (MTX) has been employed as a first-line treatment for various cancers, such as colon, breast, and lung cancer. However, the complexity and particularity of the gastrointestinal microenvironment and the limitations of MTX itself, including severe adverse effects and instability, are the main obstacles to the safe delivery of MTX to colon tumor sites. Herein, an innovative oral administrated anticancer therapeutic MTX@Am7CD/SDS NPs equipped with both pH and temperature sensitivity, which could effectively prevent MTX@Am7CD/SDS NPs from being degraded in the acidic environment mimicking the stomach and small intestine, thus harboring the potential to accumulate at the site of colon lesions and further release intestinal drug under mild conditions. In cellular assays, compared with free MTX, MTX@Am7CD/SDS NPs showed a favorable tumor inhibition effect on three tumor cell lines, as well as excellent cell uptake and apoptosis-inducing effect on SW480 cells. Therefore, this work provides a feasible solution for the safe use of MTX in the treatment of colon cancer and even other intestinal diseases. An oral gastrointestinal-based anticancer nanocarrier (Am7CD/SDS NPs) was equipped with both pH and temperature sensitivity, which could effectively prevent MTX@Am7CD/SDS NPs from being degraded in the acidic environment mimicking the stomach and small intestine, thus harboring the potential to accumulate at the site of colon lesions and further release drugs under mild conditions.image	[Chen, Shuai; Nie, Zheng-Quan; Zhu, Fang-Dao; Yang, Cui-Ting; Yang, Jian-Mei; He, Jun-Nan; Zhang, Jin; Zhao, Yan] Yunnan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiao-Qing] Shenzhen Kewode Technol Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518028, Peoples R China	Yunnan Normal University	Zhang, J; Zhao, Y (corresponding author), Yunnan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Kunming 650500, Peoples R China.	jin@ynnu.edu.cn; zhaooyann@163.com		Zhang, Jin/0000-0002-4102-1866	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations (Nos. 21961046, 21362046, and 21062030), Scientific Research Fund Project of Yunnan Education Department (No. 2023j0204), Yunnan Normal University Doctoral Research Initiation Program (No. [21961046, 21362046, 21062030]; National Natural Science Foundations [2023j0204]; Scientific Research Fund Project of Yunnan Education Department [01100205020503180]; Yunnan Normal University Doctoral Research Initiation Program [YJSJJ23-B122]; Yunnan Normal University Graduate Research Innovation Fund Project; Xing Dian Talent Support Program Foundations	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations (Nos. 21961046, 21362046, and 21062030), Scientific Research Fund Project of Yunnan Education Department (No. 2023j0204), Yunnan Normal University Doctoral Research Initiation Program (No.; National Natural Science Foundations(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Fund Project of Yunnan Education Department; Yunnan Normal University Doctoral Research Initiation Program; Yunnan Normal University Graduate Research Innovation Fund Project; Xing Dian Talent Support Program Foundations	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations (Nos. 21961046, 21362046, and 21062030), Scientific Research Fund Project of Yunnan Education Department (No. 2023j0204), Yunnan Normal University Doctoral Research Initiation Program (No. 01100205020503180), Yunnan Normal University Graduate Research Innovation Fund Project (No. YJSJJ23-B122) and Xing Dian Talent Support Program Foundations, which are gratefully acknowledged.		46	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	2192-6506			CHEMPLUSCHEM	ChemPlusChem	2023 OCT 6	2023										10.1002/cplu.202300387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cplu.202300387		OCT 2023	12	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry	T2IU4	37728035	Bronze			2023-10-18	WOS:001076277800001

In this study, a dual-track reverse cholesterol transport strategy is used to overcome the cumulative CCs in the atherosclerotic lesions via a targeting nanoplatform named as LPLCH. Endowed with the active targeting ability to the plaques, the nanoparticles can be efficiently internalized and achieve a pH-triggered charge conversion for the escape from lysosomes. During this procedure, the liver X receptor (LXR) agonists loaded in nanoparticles are replaced by the deposited lysosomal CCs, leading to a LXR mediated up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporte ABCA1/G1 with the local CCs carrying at the same time. Thus, the cumulative CCs are removed in a dual-track way of ABCA1/G1 mediated efflux and nanoparticle-based carrying. The in vivo investigations indicate that LPLCH exhibits a favorable inhibition on the plaque progression and a further reversal of formed lesions when under a healthy diet. And the RNA-sequencing suggests that the cholesterol transport also synergistically activates the anti-inflammation effect. The dual-track reverse cholesterol transport strategy performed by LPLCH delivers an exciting candidate for the effective inhibition and degradation of atherosclerosis. A targeting nanoplatform LPLCH is constructed to perform a dual-track reverse cholesterol transport strategy on atherosclerosis inhibition and degradation. LPLCH can be targeting accumulated at plaques, specifically internalized by foam cells and escape from the lysosomes. At the same time, the nanoparticles can carry the deposited cholesterol crystals and activate the cholesterol efflux, which offers a potential candidate for the efficient therapy of early-stage atherosclerosis.image	[Chen, Zhezhe; Zhu, Qiongjun; Li, Duanbin; Lv, Qingbo; Fu, Guosheng; Ma, Boxuan; Zhang, Wenbin] Zhejiang Univ, Sir Run Run Shaw Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Cardiol, Hangzhou 310016, Peoples R China; [Chen, Zhezhe; Zhu, Qiongjun; Li, Duanbin; Lv, Qingbo; Fu, Guosheng; Ma, Boxuan; Zhang, Wenbin] Key Lab Cardiovasc Intervent & Regenerat Med Zheji, Hangzhou 310016, Peoples R China	Zhejiang University	Fu, GS; Ma, BX; Zhang, WB (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sir Run Run Shaw Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Cardiol, Hangzhou 310016, Peoples R China.; Fu, GS; Ma, BX; Zhang, WB (corresponding author), Key Lab Cardiovasc Intervent & Regenerat Med Zheji, Hangzhou 310016, Peoples R China.	fugs@zju.edu.cn; boxuanma@zju.edu.cn; 3313011@zju.edu.cn			This research was financially supported by the Natural Key Research and Development Project of Zhejiang Province, China (no.

A comparative analysis of the formation of work value patterns in 65 European regions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WELFARE			English	Article; Early Access						CUPESSE; European welfare states; extrinsic values; intergenerational transmission; intrinsic values; labour market policies; multilevel analysis; NUTS 1; work values	JOB PREFERENCES; INSECURITY; ATTITUDES; QUALITY; STATES	This article analyses the driving factors behind the formation of individual work values in European welfare states. By comparing relative preferences for extrinsic and intrinsic work values, we shed light on the discussion of the effects of intergenerational transmission and the structuring effects of labour market policies and regional opportunity structures on the formation of work values. Therefore, a multilevel analysis is applied using the innovative CUPESSE data set, which provides data on young adults and their parents in 65 NUTS-1-regions from 11 European countries. The results show that individual work values of young Europeans are most substantively shaped by the respective values of their parents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individual characteristics such as sex, education and personal unemployment experiences determine preferences for work values. Finally, the paper shows that the local labour market context and welfare state arrangements also play a decisive role in the formation of individual work values.

At least 10 years later, a clinical and radiographic examination was performed on 215 patients. The marginal bone loss between baseline and follow-up for the tooth with the most severe bone loss at follow-up was estimated by radiographic measurements. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the influence of potential risk indicators on periodontitis progression.ResultsMost patients (83%) were classified as periodontitis stage III at baseline. At follow-up, 70% of these patients remained in stage III. The frequency of patients with grade C decreased from 79% to 17% at follow-up. The median (Q25%; Q75%) of the longitudinal marginal bone loss was 0.5 mm (0.0; 2.0). High bleeding on probing (BOP) index at baseline, smoking and interruption of periodontal treatment were found to significantly increase longitudinal bone loss.ConclusionsHigh levels of BOP at baseline, smoking and interruption of periodontal treatment increased the risk of marginal bone loss. The stage and grade at baseline had no significant impact on disease progression.

The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale-up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS-7, formed from tetrakis(4-sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS-7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS-7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS-7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS-7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS-7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3 mmol/g at 195 K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date. High throughput screening was used to rapidly identify a new crystalline porous salt (CPOS). Using flow chemistry, the CPOS was scaled, and the material was shown to have permeant porosity with a carbon dioxide uptake of 4.3 mmol/g at 195 K, making it one of the most porous and scalable CPOS reported to date.image	[O'Shaughnessy, Megan; Padgham, Alex; Clowes, Rob; Little, Marc; Brand, Michael; Qu, Hang; Slater, Anna; Cooper, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Mat Innovat Factory, 51 Oxford St, Liverpool L7 3NY, England; [O'Shaughnessy, Megan; Padgham, Alex; Clowes, Rob; Little, Marc; Brand, Michael; Qu, Hang; Slater, Anna; Cooper, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, 51 Oxford St, Liverpool L7 3NY, England; [O'Shaughnessy, Megan; Brand, Michael; Cooper, Andrew] Univ Liverpool, Leverhulme Res Ctr Funct Mat Design, 51 Oxford St, Liverpool L7 3NY, England	University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool; University of Liverpool	O'Shaughnessy, M; Slater, AG; Cooper, AI (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Mat Innovat Factory, 51 Oxford St, Liverpool L7 3NY, England.; O'Shaughnessy, M; Slater, AG; Cooper, AI (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Chem, 51 Oxford St, Liverpool L7 3NY, England.; O'Shaughnessy, M; Cooper, AI (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Leverhulme Res Ctr Funct Mat Design, 51 Oxford St, Liverpool L7 3NY, England.	moshaughnessy@liverpool.ac.uk; Anna.Slater@Liverpool.ac.uk; aicooper@liverpool.ac.uk		Slater, Anna Grace/0000-0002-1435-4331; Little, Marc/0000-0002-1994-0591; Padgham, Alex/0000-0003-1224-6916	The authors acknowledge funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (EP/N004884/1), the Leverhulme Trust via the Leverhulme Research Centre for Functional Materials Design.

The aim of this research was to explore experiences of accessing UK psychological services, from the perspective of those with FND.MethodsThis study utilised a qualitative approach with data collected from semi-structured interviews (n = 15) and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.ResultsOne superordinate theme, 'the stigmatised self within the therapeutic relationship', and five interrelated subthemes were identified: 'internalised stigma and self-doubt', 'selective disclosure to professionals', 'perceptions of psychological explanations', 'having to educate the professionals' and 'attunement and trust within the therapeutic relationship'. Positive therapeutic relationships were perceived to mitigate the impact of these perceived barriers. The conceptualisation of FND and the perception of how this was responded to by services and professionals was a central tenet throughout the related themes.ConclusionsIntra-personal, interpersonal and organisational stigma impact access and engagement to psychological treatment. The findings of this study highlight the need for increased training provision for practitioners with a focus on actively challenging FND stigma within services at both an individual and systemic level.

Blink rate is an established metric of cognitive load, with a higher blink frequency being observed under conditions of greater workload. Measuring blink rate requires the use of eye-trackers which limits the adoption of this metric in the real-world. The authors aim to investigate the effectiveness of using a generic camera-based system as a way to assess the user's cognitive load during a computer task. Participants completed a mental task while sitting in front of a computer. Blink rate was recorded via both the generic camera-based system and a scientific-grade eye-tracker for validation purposes. Cognitive load was also assessed through the performance in a single stimulus detection task. The blink rate recorded via the generic camera-based approach did not differ from the one obtained through the eye-tracker. No meaningful changes in blink rate were however observed with increasing cognitive load.

However, scant attention has been paid to developing best practices for the use of artificial roosts as conservation tools. Although bats readily occupy artificial roosts, occupancy and abundance data are misleading indicators of habitat quality. Lacking information on bat behavior, health, and fitness in artificial roosts, their conservation efficacy cannot be adequately validated. We considered the proximal and ultimate factors, such as evolutionarily reliable cues, that may prompt bats to preferentially use and show fidelity to suboptimal artificial roosts even when high-quality alternatives are available. Possible negative health and fitness consequences for artificial roost inhabitants include exposure to unstable and extreme microclimates in poorly designed roosts, and vulnerability to larger numbers of ectoparasites in longer lasting artificial roosts that house larger bat colonies than in natural roosts. Bats using artificial roosts may have lower survival rates if predators have easy access to roosts placed in conspicuous locations. Bats may be lured into occupying low-quality habitats if attractive artificial roosts are deployed on polluted urban and agricultural landscapes. To advance the science behind artificial bat roosts, we present testable research hypotheses and suggestions to improve the quality of artificial roosts for bats and decrease risks to occupants. Because continued loss of natural roosts may increase reliance on alternatives, such as artificial roosts, it is imperative that this conservation practice be improved.

J	Giannaros, C; Dafis, S; Kotroni, V; Lagouvardos, K				Giannaros, Christos; Dafis, Stavros; Kotroni, Vassiliki; Lagouvardos, Konstantinos			The extreme heat wave of late July/early August 2021 in Greece under the context of the direct effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; extreme event attribution; Greece; heat waves; regional modeling; WRF	ATTRIBUTION	Greece is characterized by a significant warming trend in recent decades, accompanied by increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves (HWs). A particularly devastating HW that affected the country was the late July/early August 2021 event (JA2021HW), which lasted for 9 days (July 28-August 5). Focusing on the hottest day of the event (August 3), the main characteristics of JA2021HW are presented in the current study, using model reanalysis data and up to 11-year observations derived from the dense network of ground-based weather stations operated by the Meteo Unit at the National Observatory of Athens (NOA). This analysis highlights the severity of JA2021HW, especially in the central and southernmost regions of Greece. Most importantly, the impact of the direct effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases to the examined extreme event, in terms of intensity and probability of occurrence, is examined by employing a regional 31-member ensemble (ENS) modeling approach based on Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which is operationally used by NOA/Meteo. Firstly, WRF is validated under 7-day lead-time ENS simulations with current-state greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (GHG_2021 ENS), showing a robust model performance in replicating the JA2021HW's magnitude on August 3rd. Then, 7-day lead-time ENS simulations with the GHG concentrations reduced to the pre-industrial (1854) levels (GHG_1854 ENS) are performed and compared to the GHG_2021 ENS experiment. The results reveal a contribution of the immediate anthropogenic warming due to the increased GHG concentrations to the JA2021HW intensity in West and South continental and insular Greece, which can be important in the framework of the human health impacts of extreme temperatures. For the event's occurrence probability, no robust evidence of any change could be derived. These statements are partially constrained by the fact that only the direct GHG effect on the timescale of a few days was examined. This study presents a climatic overview of the extreme heat wave that affected Greece during the summer of 2021 (July 28-August 5), using model reanalysis data and up to 11-year temperature observations derived from a nation-wide network of surface weather stations. Most importantly, by comparing ensemble simulations of the actual event to a pre-industrial scenario concerning the greenhouse gas concentrations, differences in the heat wave magnitude and probability of occurrence, attributed to the direct effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, are investigated.image	[Giannaros, Christos] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Athens 15784, Greece; [Dafis, Stavros; Kotroni, Vassiliki; Lagouvardos, Konstantinos] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens, Greece	National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; National Observatory of Athens	Giannaros, C (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Phys, Athens 15784, Greece.	cgiannaros@phys.uoa.gr			Christos Giannaros acknowledges the support provided by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (H.F.R.I.) under the "3d Call for H.F.R.I.

This research investigated dietary diversity and food choice drivers among low-income consumers in three urban settlements (Nairobi, Kenya; Bulawayo, Zimbabwe and Lilongwe, Malawi, representing rapid, moderate and slow urban growth patterns, respectively) as a first step towards improving diets across cultures and geographies.MethodsMixed methods data collection was employed for this study. Qualitative methods such as rapid foodscape appraisal workshops and food stories in selected low-income settlements in Nairobi, Bulawayo and Lilongwe were utilised to collect information on the food environments (food balances, infrastructure, safety, policies and institutions). Quantitative data such as socio-demographic characteristics and dietary diversity were collected via structured questionnaires using Cognitive Edge's SenseMaker (R) (n = 890, 450 and 440 for Nairobi, Bulawayo and Lilongwe, respectively). The dietary intake of respondents was assessed using a 24-h recall, which was then converted to the food group diversity score (FGDS).ResultsDifferent levels of compounded stress affected dietary diversity and quality, including high food prices, concerns about sanitation and hygiene and the role of food standards regulation bodies. The mean FGDS across all locations was lower than the recommended cut-off of 5 (4.5, 2.8 and 2.6 across Nairobi, Zimbabwe and Lilongwe, respectively). Additionally, in Nairobi, there were gender differences in diet diversity, with men having a higher dietary diversity score than women (4.6% vs. 4.3%; p = 0.004). The majority of respondents in Lilongwe (65%) reported price as the most important driver of food choice, compared to 38% in Nairobi and 42% in Bulawayo.Discussion/ConclusionsOur observation of poor-quality diets provides further evidence of the need for food policies that are cognisant of the nutrition and health of the growing population of the urban poor. Such policies would focus on lowering the costs of nutritious foods as well as ensuring food safety within the complex food system observed in the urban low-income environment. Using a theoretical framework that assessed demographic characteristics and various food environments, we determined drivers of diet diversity and food choice in selected low-income settlements in Nairobi (Kenya), Bulawayo (Zimbabwe) and Lilongwe (Malawi). Overall, all respondents identified their change in attitude as an important driver of dietary diversification. From the Nairobi responses, convenience (40% of respondents) was the main factor influencing food choice, whereas price was the most important factor in Bulawayo (31% of respondents) and Lilongwe (67% of respondents). Price and convenience are important factors to consider for improving diet diversity in urban low-income settlements. Our findings can potentially guide future nutrition interventions and dietetic practice towards stimulating healthier eating behaviour and sustainable diets more appropriately.image An investigation conducted in contrasting food environments in three urban low-income settlements in Lilongwe, Bulawayo and Nairobi suggests low consumption of nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits and animal-source foods.Several drivers of dietary diversity and food choice, as well as perceptions, were identified. Price and convenience were identified as key drivers of food choice, with gender differences reported in dietary diversity.Policies and programmes need to consider steering diets towards higher consumption of nutrient-dense foods while taking into account price, convenience and environmental sustainability.

What accounts for turnover intention in the Australian public mental health workforce?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article; Early Access						burnout; job satisfaction; mental health workforce; retention; turnover intention; understaffing	JOB-SATISFACTION; BURNOUT; WORKING; RETENTION; SERVICES	High staff turnover is common within the Australian public mental health workforce, contributing to workforce shortages and ultimately impacting the ability to provide stable efficient, effective, and ongoing optimal care to the community. In this study, we aimed to (a) establish the most pertinent factors associated with increased turnover intention in the public mental health workforce in Australia, and (b) establish whether such factors differ between metropolitan and rural services. We used a cross-sectional, correlational design using an online survey method. In total, 235 mental health service staff of various disciplines and levels, from four public hospitals in Victoria, Australia participated in the study. We used three feed-forward multiple regression analyses to assess the study aims. We found that job satisfaction, occupational burnout, and understaffing may be the most pertinent factors to consider regarding turnover intention. Job satisfaction and occupational burnout were factors endorsed across the entire sample, as well as specifically within both the metropolitan and rural services, while understaffing was a pertinent factor regarding turnover intention across the entire sample and for rural services, but not metropolitan services. Our findings regarding the pertinence of job satisfaction, occupational burnout, and understaffing in turnover intention provide key information that may be used to inform interventional targets aimed at reducing attrition from the public mental health workforce in Australia.

In order to transfer this technology from the lab onto the market, a techno-economic analysis at an industrialized scale should be conducted on process routes with the potential for low-cost scale-up. Herein, such an analysis of four PST architectures by calculating the cost of ownership (COO) for the perovskite production process routes with an annual capacity of 1 GWp on a silicon heterojunction bottom cell in a bifacial module configuration is shown. The first two routes focus on 4-terminal PSTs produced using vacuum processing, one each in p-i-n and n-i-p configurations. The remaining routes utilize slot-die deposition as a single step or as the second step conversion of PbI2 for the perovskite deposition of a monolithic 2-terminal perovskite on silicon cell. The process routes are analyzed in three scenarios taking into consideration the changing PV value chain up to 2030. The COOs are then used to determine the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for each device.

J	Lv, D; Liu, DY				Lv, Dan; Liu, Dianyi			Intrinsically Stretchable Fiber-Shaped Solar Cells with Polymer-Based Active Layer	SOLAR RRL			English	Article; Early Access						all-polymer; fiber-shape; organic semiconductors; solar cells; stretchability	PERFORMANCE	Fiber-shaped organic solar cells (FOSCs) with intrinsic stretchability show great potential in stretchable and wearable electronics applications. However, limited by the poor stretchability of small molecule semiconductors, the stretchability of FOSCs is still not satisfied. Polymerized nonfullerene acceptors with excellent photovoltaic performance are a promising strategy for preparing stretchable semiconductors and photovoltaics. Herein, an efficient polymer-based bulk-heterojunction blend is adopted as the photoactive material of the stretchable all-polymer FOSCs. The fabricated all-polymer FOSCs show superior intrinsic stretchability that remains more than 90% of the initial efficiency under the stretch strain of 50% and maintains stable performance even when undergoing hundreds of stretching-releasing cycles. By adding the third component of polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) elastomer, the stretchable all-polymer FOSCs can endure the ultrahigh stretch strains over 80%. This study demonstrates the superior mechanical properties of the all-polymer FOSCs and the simple yet effective strategy of SEBS additive to enhance stretchability. Intrinsically stretchable fiber-shaped organic solar cells (FOSCs) are fabricated by all-polymer-based active layer. The devices can remain over 90% of the initial efficiency under the stretch strain within 50%. By adding the third component of polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene elastomer, the FOSCs can endure the ultrahigh stretch strains of over 80% and remain 90% of the initial efficiency after 1000 stretching cycles.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH	[Lv, Dan; Liu, Dianyi] Westlake Univ, Res Ctr Ind Future, Key Lab Micro 3D Nano Fabricat & Characterizat Zhe, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lv, Dan; Liu, Dianyi] Westlake Univ, Sch Engn, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lv, Dan; Liu, Dianyi] Westlake Inst Adv Study, Inst Adv Technol, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lv, Dan; Liu, Dianyi] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China	Westlake University; Westlake University; Westlake University; Zhejiang University	Liu, DY (corresponding author), Westlake Univ, Res Ctr Ind Future, Key Lab Micro 3D Nano Fabricat & Characterizat Zhe, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Liu, DY (corresponding author), Westlake Univ, Sch Engn, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Liu, DY (corresponding author), Westlake Inst Adv Study, Inst Adv Technol, Hangzhou 310030, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Liu, DY (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.	liudianyi@westlake.edu.cn		Lv, Dan/0000-0003-3943-4466	This work was supported by the Westlake Education Foundation.

Using cultured rat calvarial osteoblasts exposed to microgravity simulated by a random positioning machine, this study addressed the hypotheses that microgravity-induced shortening of primary cilia leads to oxidative stress and that primary cilium protection prevents oxidative stress and osteogenesis loss. Microgravity was found to induce oxidative stress (as represented by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde production, and decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes), which was perfectly replicated in osteoblasts growing in NG with abrogated primary cilia (created by transfection of an interfering RNA), suggesting the possibility that shortening of primary cilia leads to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction (represented by increased mitochondrial ROS and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential) and intracellular Ca2+ overload, and the latter was found to be caused by increased activity of Ca2+ channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), as also evidenced by TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A-elicited Ca2+ influx. Supplementation of HC-067047, a specific antagonist of TRPV4, attenuated microgravity-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and osteogenesis loss. Although TRPV4 was found localized in primary cilia and expressed at low levels in NG, microgravity-induced shortening of primary cilia led to increased TRPV4 levels and Ca2+ influx. When primary cilia were protected by miR-129-3p overexpression or supplementation with a natural flavonoid moslosooflavone, microgravity-induced increased TRPV4 expression, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and osteogenesis loss were all prevented. Our data revealed a new mechanism that primary cilia function as a controller for TRPV4 expression. Microgravity-induced injury on primary cilia leads to increased expression and overactive channel of TRPV4, causing intracellular Ca2+ overload and oxidative stress, and primary cilium protection could be an effective countermeasure against microgravity-induced oxidative stress and loss of osteogenic potential of osteoblasts. Primary cilium on most mammalian cells is a microtubule structure protruding from cell surface where many receptors and ion channels such as TRPV4 are localized. In this study, primary cilia of rat calvarial osteoblasts were found to become shorter and even disappeared when the cells were exposed to a random positioning machine-simulated microgravity, accompanied by increased expression and overactive Ca2+ channel of TRPV4, which induced overload Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and loss of osteogenesis. Protection of primary cilia by overexpression of miR-129-3p or moslosooflavone prevented the TRPV4-mediated overload Ca2+ influx and all above-mentioned changes, indicating that protection of primary cilia should be an effective countermeasure to the simulated microgravity-induced oxidative stress and loss of osteogenic potential of osteoblasts.image	[Miao, Lu-Wei; Liu, Tian-Zhen; Sun, Yue-Hong; Cai, Nan; Xuan, Ying-Ying; Wei, Zhenlong; Cui, Bing-Bing; Gao, Yu-Hai; Chen, Ke-Ming] 940th Hosp Joint Logist Support Force, Peoples Liberat Army China, Fundamental Med Sci Res Labs, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Jing, Lin-Lin; Ma, Hui-Ping] 940th Hosp Joint Logist Support Force, Peoples Liberat Army China, Dept Pharm, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Xian, Cory J.] Univ South Australia, UniSA Clin & Hlth Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Wang, Ju-Fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Modern Phys, Gansu Key Lab Space Radiobiol, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ke-Ming] Key Lab Stem Cells & Gene Drugs Gansu Prov, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Gao, Yu-Hai; Chen, Ke-Ming] 333 Bihe South Rd, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China	University of South Australia; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Modern Physics, CAS	Gao, YH; Chen, KM (corresponding author), 333 Bihe South Rd, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China.	gyh1389@126.com; chenkm@lut.edu.cn			This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.: 81571847, 31870851 and 81770879).

Deconditioning-update promotes robust and long-lasting attenuation of aversive memories. The deconditioning protocol consists of applying weak/neutral footshocks during reactivations, so that the original tone-shock association is replaced by an innocuous stimulus that does not produce significant fear response. Here, we present the molecular bases that can support this mechanism. To this end, we used pharmacological tools to inhibit the activity of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA-GluN2B and CP-AMPA), the activity of proteases (calpains), and the receptors that control intracellular calcium storage (IP3 receptors), as well as the endocannabinoid system (CB1). Our results indicate that blocking these molecular targets prevents fear memory update by deconditioning. Therefore, this study uncovered the molecular substrate of deconditioning-update strategy, and, broadly, shed new light on the traumatic memory destabilization mechanisms that might be used to break the boundaries regarding reconsolidation-based approaches to deal with maladaptive memories.

However, despite its importance, statistics on the age and sex patterns are largely absent and, where they do exist, there are considerable differences in measurement and data collection procedures. In this study, we develop a methodology for indirectly estimating the age and sex patterns of international migration for 53 populations in the Asia-Pacific region and four macroworld regions. Multiplicative component models are used to systematically combine information from multiple data sources and infer missing data, resulting in complete and harmonised tables of migration by origin, destination, age, and sex from 2000 to 2019. The estimates are presented and assessed with some discussions on how they may be applied and further improved.

MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access							MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION; HIGH-ENTROPY ALLOY; SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; CARBON-STEEL; ANTIBACTERIAL; INHIBITION; SURFACTANTS; MITIGATION; PROTECTION; RESISTANCE	The global economic burden of microbial corrosion of metals is enormous. Microbial corrosion of iron-containing metals is most extensive under anaerobic conditions. Microbes form biofilms on metal surfaces and can directly extract electrons derived from the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ to support anaerobic respiration. H2 generated from abiotic Fe0 oxidation also serves as an electron donor for anaerobic respiratory microbes. Microbial metabolites accelerate this abiotic Fe0 oxidation. Traditional strategies for curbing microbial metal corrosion include cathodic protection, scrapping, a diversity of biocides, alloys that form protective layers or release toxic metal ions, and polymer coatings. However, these approaches are typically expensive and/or of limited applicability and not environmentally friendly. Biotechnology may provide more effective and sustainable solutions. Biocides produced with microbes can be less toxic to eukaryotes, expanding the environments for potential application. Microbially produced surfactants can diminish biofilm formation by corrosive microbes, as can quorum-sensing inhibitors. Amendments of phages or predatory bacteria have been successful in attacking corrosive microbes in laboratory studies. Poorly corrosive microbes can form biofilms and/or deposit extracellular polysaccharides and minerals that protect the metal surface from corrosive microbes and their metabolites. Nitrate amendments permit nitrate reducers to outcompete highly corrosive sulphate-reducing microbes, reducing corrosion. Investigation of all these more sustainable corrosion mitigation strategies is in its infancy. More study, especially under environmentally relevant conditions, including diverse microbial communities, is warranted. Microbial corrosion of metals is a major global economic burden. This manuscript briefly summarizes traditional strategies for corrosion mitigation and describes novel, more sustainable, approaches that show promise but require further experimental evaluationimage	[Wang, Di; Zhou, Enze; Xu, Dake; Lovley, Derek R.] Northeastern Univ, Electrobiomat Inst, Key Lab Anisotropy & Texture Mat, Minist Educ, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Di; Zhou, Enze; Xu, Dake] Northeastern Univ, Shenyang Natl Lab Mat Sci, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Lovley, Derek R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Microbiol, Amherst, MA USA	Northeastern University - China; Northeastern University - China; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst	Xu, DK; Lovley, DR (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Electrobiomat Inst, Key Lab Anisotropy & Texture Mat, Minist Educ, Shenyang, Peoples R China.	xudake@mail.neu.edu.cn; dlovley@umass.edu		Lovley, Derek/0000-0001-7158-3555	D.X. was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFB3808800), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U2006219), and the China Baowu Low Carbon Metallurgy Innovation Foundation (BWLCF202120 [2022YFB3808800]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [U2006219]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [BWLCF202120]; China Baowu Low Carbon Metallurgy Innovation Foundation	D.X. was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFB3808800), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U2006219), and the China Baowu Low Carbon Metallurgy Innovation Foundation (BWLCF202120; National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Baowu Low Carbon Metallurgy Innovation Foundation	D.X. was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFB3808800), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. U2006219), and the China Baowu Low Carbon Metallurgy Innovation Foundation (BWLCF202120).		103	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1751-7915			MICROB BIOTECHNOL	Microb.

Allopolyploidy may lead to the activation of transposable elements (TE). However, the mechanism of epigenetic modification of TEs in the establishment and evolution of allopolyploids remains to be explored. We focused on the TEs of model allopolyploid Brassica napus (AnAnCnCn), exploring the TE characteristics of the genome, epigenetic modifications of TEs during allopolyploidization, and regulation of gene expression by TE methylation. In B. napus, approximately 50% of the genome was composed of TEs. TEs increased with proximity to genes, especially DNA transposons. TE methylation levels were negatively correlated with gene expression, and changes in TE methylation levels were able to regulate the expression of neighboring genes related to responses to light intensity and stress, which promoted powerful adaptation of allopolyploids to new environments. TEs can be synergistically regulated by RNA-directed DNA methylation pathways and histone modifications. The epigenetic modification levels of TEs tended to be similar to those of the diploid parents during the genome evolution of B. napus. The TEs of the An subgenome were more likely to be modified, and the imbalance in TE number and epigenetic modification level in the An and Cn subgenomes may lead to the establishment of subgenome dominance. Our study analyzed the characteristics of TE location, DNA methylation, siRNA, and histone modification in B. napus and highlighted the importance of TE epigenetic modifications during the allopolyploidy process, providing support for revealing the mechanism of allopolyploid formation and evolution.

However, the potential impact of BRD4 in ameloblastoma (AM) remains largely unknown. Herein, we aimed to assess the expression and functional role of BRD4 in AM.MethodsThe expression level of BRD4 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The proliferation, migration, invasion, and tumorigenic abilities of AM cells were assessed by a series of assays. To explore the molecular expression profile of BRD4-depleted AM cells, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed. Bioinformatic analysis was performed on AM expression matrices obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The therapeutic efficacy of BET-inhibitors (BETi) was assessed with AM patient-derived organoids.ResultsUpregulation of BRD4 was observed in conventional AMs, recurrent AMs, and ameloblastic carcinomas. Depletion of BRD4 inhibited proliferation, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis in AM. Administration of BETi attenuated the aggressiveness of AM and the growth of AM patient-derived organoids. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that BRD4 may promote AM progression by regulating the Wnt pathway and stemness-associated pathways.ConclusionBRD4 increases the aggressiveness and promotes the recurrence of ameloblastoma by regulating the Wnt pathway and stemness-associated pathways. These findings highlight BRD4 as a promising therapeutic target in AM management.

The virulence of Dichelobacter nodosus, measured by the elastase test, is an important predictor for virulent footrot diagnosis in New South Wales sheep flocks	AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						acidic protease; benign; Dichelobacter nodosus; elastase; virulent footrot	PATHOGENESIS; INFECTION; ETIOLOGY; STRAINS; ROT	Ovine footrot is a contagious bacterial disease that causes foot lesions, and depending on the virulence of the causative strains, may lead to severe underrunning of the hoof and lameness. Virulent footrot can be identified, treated and controlled more effectively than less virulent benign forms. The in vitro elastase test for virulence of the causative bacteria, Dichelobacter nodosus, has been used to support clinical diagnosis. However, not all laboratory-designated virulent D. nodosus strains cause clinical signs of virulent footrot. This study evaluated retrospectively how well the elastase test supported clinical footrot diagnosis in 150 sheep flocks examined for suspect footrot in New South Wales between August 2020 and December 2021. Flocks were included if measures of clinical disease, environmental conditions and the virulence of D. nodosus isolates were available. Variation in the elastase activity result between D. nodosus isolated from the same flock made bacterial virulence hard to interpret, but calculating the mean elastase rate for all isolates from the same flock made correlations between bacterial virulence and flock footrot diagnosis possible. Simplifying bacterial virulence into whether there were any elastase-positive D. nodosus isolates before 12 days increased the predictive value of elastase results for virulent diagnosis, compared with using the first day that any isolate was elastase positive or the percentage of elastase-positive isolates by 12 days, but not all clinically virulent flocks had isolates with elastase activity before 12 days. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify the minimum number of predictors for virulent footrot diagnosis, with models suggesting that virulent footrot diagnosis was best predicted by adding the elastase test result and environmental conditions to the prevalence of severe foot lesions (score 4 and 5). However, performing the same analysis with different breeds, ages of sheep and seasons might highlight other factors important in the diagnosis of virulent footrot.

No analytical controls are mandatory for these products leading to uncertainties about composition and quality. In this paper, a methodology was developed to identify the oil matrix and to estimate the CBD content in such samples, using mid-infrared and near-infrared spectroscopy. Different oils were selected based on the information labeled on products and were bought in food stores in order to create a sample set with a variety of matrices. These oils were spiked with CBD to obtain samples with CBD levels from 0% to 20%. The first part of the study was focused on the qualitative analysis of the oil matrix. A classification model, based on Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy, was build using the spiked oils to distinguish between the different oil matrices. For both spectroscopic techniques, the sensitivity, the specificity, the accuracy and the precision were equal to 100%. These models were applied to determine the oil matrix of seized samples. The second part of the study was focused on the quantitative estimation of CBD. After determination of CBD in seized samples using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, partial least square regression (PLS-R) models were built, one for each matrix in the sample set. Both techniques were able to classify unknown oily samples according to their matrix, and although only few samples were available to evaluate the PLS-R models, the approach clearly showed promising results for the estimation of the CBD content in oil samples. CBD oils on Internet and so on has increased, and no analytical controls are mandatory for these products. A methodology was developed to identify the oil matrix (previously characterized by GC-MS) and to estimate the CBD content (previously determined by GC-MS/MS) using NIR and MIR spectroscopies combined with chemometrics.image	[Duchateau, Celine; Stevigny, Caroline; De Braekeleer, Kris; Deconinck, Eric] ULB, Fac Pharm, Pharmacognosy Bioanal & Drug Discovery Unit, RD3, Brussels, Belgium; [Duchateau, Celine; Deconinck, Eric] Sciensano, Med & Hlth Prod, Sci Direct Phys & Chem Hlth Risks, Brussels, Belgium	Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Sciensano	Deconinck, E (corresponding author), Sciensano, Med & Hlth Prod, Sci Direct Phys & Chem Hlth Risks, Brussels, Belgium.	eric.deconinck@sciensano.be		Deconinck, Eric/0000-0001-6980-6684	The authors would like to thank Basma Najar and Marie Faes from RD3-PBM unit of the Faculty of Pharmacy of ULB for the technical support.

We aimed to develop and validate a prenatal-screening artificial intelligence system (PSAIS) for real-time evaluation of the quality of anatomical images, indicating existing and missing structures.MethodsStill ultrasonographic images obtained from fetuses of 18-32 weeks of gestation between 2017 and 2018 were used to develop PSAIS based on YOLOv3 with global (anatomic site) and local (structures) feature extraction that could evaluate the image quality and indicate existing and missing structures in the fetal anatomical images. The performance of the PSAIS in recognizing 19 standard views was evaluated using retrospective real-world fetal scan video validation datasets from four hospitals. We stratified sampled frames (standard, similar-to-standard, and background views at approximately 1:1:1) for experts to blindly verify the results.ResultsThe PSAIS was trained using 134 696 images and validated using 836 videos with 12 697 images. For internal and external validations, the multiclass macro-average areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.943 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.815-1.000) and 0.958 (0.864-1.000); the micro-average areas were 0.974 (0.970-0.979) and 0.973 (0.965-0.981), respectively. For similar-to-standard views, the PSAIS accurately labeled 90.9% (90.0%-91.4%) with key structures and indicated missing structures.ConclusionsAn artificial intelligence system developed to assist trainees in fetal anomaly screening demonstrated high agreement with experts in standard view identification. An artificial intelligence system developed for trainees showed high agreement with experts in identifying standard view, which may promote novice operators to obtain diagnostic images.

Structural Diversity in Cyclometalated Diiridium(III) Complexes with Bridging syn and anti μ<sub>2</sub>-Oxamidato and μ<sub>2</sub>-Dithioxamidato Ligands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						iridium; bimetallic; luminescence; X-ray crystallography; density functional theory	EFFECTIVE CORE POTENTIALS; SET MODEL CHEMISTRY; IRIDIUM(III) COMPLEXES; MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; IR(III) COMPLEXES; TOTAL ENERGIES; III COMPLEXES; PHOSPHORESCENCE; BEARING; ATOMS	Six new diiridium complexes containing 2-methyl-6-phenylpyridyl as the cyclometalating ligand with a mu(2)-oxamidato or a mu(2)-dithioxamidato ligand as the bridge have been synthesized in 60-73 % yields. These complexes were revealed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy to contain inseparable mixtures of diastereomers (rac, Delta Delta/Lambda Lambda and meso, Delta Lambda) with bridges in anti and syn configurations. The remarkable variety of isomers present was confirmed by X-ray crystallography on single crystals grown from mixtures of each complex. In one complex with a N,N'-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-mu(2)-oxamidato bridge, two single crystals of anti and syn isomers were structurally determined. Two single crystals of the mu(2)-dithioxamidato bridge complex were found to contain rac and meso forms of the syn isomer. Hybrid DFT computations on the four isomers of each diiridium complex revealed negligible energetic preferences for one isomer despite the methyl groups in the 2-methyl-6-phenylpyridyl cyclometalating ligands being close to the neighboring methyl groups and the bridge, thus supporting the experimental findings of isomer mixtures. Two distinct broad emissions with maxima at 522-529 nm and at 689-701 nm observed in these complexes in dichloromethane are attributed to mixed metal-ligand to ligand charge transfer (MLLCT) excited states involving the pyridyl and bridge moieties respectively with the aid of electronic structure computations.

This study investigates its predictive performance in an Australian setting.MethodsA single-centre retrospective external validation study was conducted at a tertiary referral centre in New South Wales, Australia. Data from a general surgical cohort in a 2-year period from 2020 to 2021 was collected from the NSQIP database and entered into the NSQIP calculator. The predictive performance of the calculator was analysed across the standard 14 NSQIP postoperative outcome measures at 30 days.ResultsThere were 2121 patient records analysed using tests of accuracy and in the discrimination and calibration domains. The overall predictive performance of the NSQIP calculator was reasonable. There was greater accuracy at lower-risk predictions. At higher-risk predictions, Readmission, Death, and Discharge to Nursing or Rehab Facility, and Length of Stay were overestimated, whilst other outcomes were underestimated.ConclusionThis study demonstrates reasonable overall performance of the NSQIP calculator in the context of this cohort and provides data to support the need for locally adapted and validated risk prediction tools for use by Australian perioperative physicians. The NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator is a useful perioperative tool that has been well validated in the North American context but there has been inadequate evidence for its validity in the Australian population. The overall predictive performance of the NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator is acceptable in an Australian general surgical population context. The NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator is a useful tool to assist all Australian physicians with risk prediction and the shared-decision making process in the surgical journey.image	[Moi, Daniel; Olesnicky, Ben; Zanjani, Negar; Wang, Andy; Mulligan, Michelle] Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia Pain & Perioperat Med, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia	Royal North Shore Hospital	Moi, D (corresponding author), Royal North Shore Hosp, Dept Anaesthesia Pain & Perioperat Med, St Leonards, NSW 2065, Australia.	drdanielmoi@gmail.com			The authors would like to thank and acknowledge Dr George Akiki, Dr Kate Leaper, Dr Andrew Mowbray, and Dr Andrew Turner for their significant time contribution in manual data entry of patient data variables into the online NSQIP SRC.

The intraoperative and postoperative recovery of the patients in both groups were compared, and the reliability and validity of the application of MR were further examined using the Likert scale.ResultsThere was a significant difference in the mean intraoperative bleeding volume between the two groups, but it was reduced in the MR group. The results of the Likert scale showed higher scores in the MR group than non-MR group.ConclusionsMR can be used to assist PRT resection and has great potential to improve the rate of complete retroperitoneal tumour resection.

In this study, the effects of TPL on HCT116 human colon cancer cells and CCD841 human colon epithelial cells are first evaluated. Next, the protein targets of TPL in HCT116 cells are identified through an activity-based protein profiling approach. With subsequent in vitro experiments, the mode of action of TPL in HCT116 cells is elucidated. As a result, TPL is found to selectively inhibit HCT116 cell viability and migration. A total of 54 proteins are identified as the targets of TPL in HCT116 cells, among which, Annexin A1 (ANXA1) and Peroxiredoxin I/II (Prdx I/II) are picked out for further investigation due to their important role in CRC. The interaction between TPL and ANXA1 or Prdx I is confirmed, and it is discovered that TPL exerts inhibitory effect against HCT116 cells through binding to ANXA1 and Prdx I. The study reinforces the potential of TPL in the CRC therapy, and provides novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRC. A quantitative proteomics approach is employed to identify the protein targets of triptolide in HCT116 cells, and triptolide is elucidated to inhibit cell viability and migration through binding to Peroxiredoxin 1 and Annexin A1.image	[Song, Fangli; Shi, Qiaoli; Wang, Jigang] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Chinese Mat Med, Artemisinin Res Ctr, State Key Lab Qual Ensurance & Sustainable Use Dao, Beijing 10700, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinglin; Wong, Yin Kwan; Lin, Qingsong] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117600, Singapore; [Chen, Xiao] China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Biopharm, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China	China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; National University of Singapore; China Pharmaceutical University	Wang, JG (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Inst Chinese Mat Med, Artemisinin Res Ctr, State Key Lab Qual Ensurance & Sustainable Use Dao, Beijing 10700, Peoples R China.; Lin, QS (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Biol Sci, Singapore 117600, Singapore.; Chen, X (corresponding author), China Pharmaceut Univ, Sch Biopharm, Nanjing 210009, Peoples R China.	dbslinqs@nus.edu.sg; jgwang@icmm.ac.cn; xchen@cpu.edu.cn	Wang, Jigang/K-9584-2014	Wang, Jigang/0000-0002-0575-0105	This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0908000 and 2022YFC2303600); the Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No: ZYYCX [2020YFA0908000, 2022YFC2303600]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [ZYYCXTD-C-202002]; Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine [CI2021A05101, CI2021A05104]; CACMS Innovation Fund [CI2021B014]; Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences [JCYJ20200109120205924]; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission [2021A1515012164]; GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [GJHZ20200731095411034]; International Science and Technology Cooperation for Shenzhen Technology Innovation Plan [2632022ZD09]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities	This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0908000 and 2022YFC2303600); the Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No: ZYYCX; National Key Research and Development Program of China; Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine; CACMS Innovation Fund; Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission; GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; International Science and Technology Cooperation for Shenzhen Technology Innovation Plan; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)	This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFA0908000 and 2022YFC2303600); the Innovation Team and Talents Cultivation Program of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (No: ZYYCXTD-C-202002); the CACMS Innovation Fund (CI2021A05101 and CI2021A05104); the Scientific and Technological Innovation Project of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CI2021B014); the Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission (JCYJ20200109120205924), GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515012164), International Science and Technology Cooperation for Shenzhen Technology Innovation Plan (GJHZ20200731095411034), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2632022ZD09).		56	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	2701-0198			ADV BIOL-GER	Adv.

Furthermore, fast typology (FT) individuals fatigue more than slow typology (ST) individuals in lab conditions. Therefore, we investigated if muscle typology is different between playing positions and if the decay in high-intensity activities from the first to the second half is larger in FT football players than in ST players. We estimated muscle typology in 147 male professional football players by measuring soleus and gastrocnemius muscle carnosine via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Players were classified as ST, intermediate typology (IT) or FT and categorized as goalkeeper, center back, full back, midfielder, winger or forward. Across four seasons in-game distances covered in multiple running speed, acceleration and deceleration zones were collected during the first and second half. We found no differences in muscle typology between positions (p = 0.412). FT players covered 10.9% more high acceleration distance (>3 m.s-2) in the first half than ST players (p = 0.021) and high acceleration distance decay was larger for FT players (-12.4%) than ST (-7.7%; p = 0.006) and IT players (-7.3%; p = 0.010). Moreover, the decline in distance covered in several high-intensity zones tended to be larger in FT players (-11.2% high-intensity >15 km.h-1; -12.7% high deceleration <-3 m.s-2; -11.5% medium acceleration 2-3 m.s-2) than in ST players (-7.1% high-intensity; -8.1% high deceleration; -8.1% medium acceleration; 0.05 < p < 0.1). In conclusion, possessing a particular muscle typology is not required to play any football position at the national level. However, there are indications that FT players might fatigue more toward the end of the game compared to ST players.

J	Wang, XY; Zhan, XY; Xu, YS				Wang, Xiaoyun; Zhan, Xueyong; Xu, Yushan			Governing nonprofits under competing institutional logics: The implementation of board governance in China	GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND INSTITUTIONS			English	Article; Early Access							PATH DEPENDENCE; ORGANIZATIONS; GOVERNMENT; SOCIETY	Privatization reform originated in Western countries and was translated across political regimes. While extensive literature discusses the practices of privatization in liberal democracies, little has been written on its implementation in authoritarian contexts, where the logic of privatization is incompatible with the logic of authoritarianism. This study explores the adoption of a specific administrative model promoted by the privatization reform: nonprofit board governance in Shenzhen, China. We find that, although the nonprofit board is the formal governing structure, regulatory agencies constrain the autonomy of boards, decoupling governance practices from board governance. Two organizational-level contingency factors-institutional origins and political risks-help explain the balance of the competing logics and the degree of decoupling from board governance. These findings suggest that, within the global privatization movement, the seemingly converging administrative structures embody divergent practices when adapting to local contexts.

The proposed school-based intervention aimed to socialize, educate, and cultivate Black boys in preparation for manhood. Theoretically, the conceptual framework was anchored in African paradigms from Afrocentricity, Kawaida, and Pan-Africanism. The authors provided an overview of the program, which included the program structure, activities, and events. We concluded with a discussion of program challenges and recommendations for future research and program implementation. Rites of passage (ROP) programs have been advanced as one strategy that can be a solution to support Black male students and improve their academic and social standing in schools and their communities and help them develop into productive men.Any program created for Black boys should: (a) be African-centered, (b) operate from a strength and asset-based perspective of them, their families, and communities, (c) incorporate a global perspective of Black history and culture, and (d) prepare them to solve problems impacting their local, the national, and global Black community.In Black communities throughout the United States, Black men have taken responsibility for recreating the ROP process for Black boys in their local communities.

Potential measurement error from vessel reflex and multiple light paths in dual-wavelength retinal oximetry	ACTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA			English	Article; Early Access						ophthalmological imaging; oxygen saturation; retinal oximetry; vessel diameter	BLOOD-FLOW; OXYGEN-SATURATION; VELOCITY	Purpose: This study aims to characterize the dependence of measured retinal arterial and venous saturation on vessel diameter and central reflex in retinal oximetry, with an ultimate goal of identifying potential causes and suggesting approaches to improve measurement accuracy.Methods: In 10 subjects, oxygen saturation, vessel diameter and optical density are obtained using Oxymap Analyzer software without diameter correction. Diameter dependence of saturation is characterized using linear regression between measured values of saturation and diameter. Occurrences of negative values of vessel optical densities (ODs) associated with central vessel reflex are acquired from Oxymap Analyzer. A conceptual model is used to calculate the ratio of optical densities (ODRs) according to retinal reflectance properties and single and double-pass light transmission across fixed path lengths. Model-predicted values are compared with measured oximetry values at different vessel diameters.Results: Venous saturation shows an inverse relationship with vessel diameter (D) across subjects, with a mean slope of -0.180 (SE = 0.022) %/mu m (20 < D < 180 mu m) and a more rapid saturation increase at small vessel diameters reaching to over 80%. Arterial saturation yields smaller positive and negative slopes in individual subjects, with an average of -0.007 (SE = 0.021) %/mu m (20 < D < 200 mu m) across all subjects. Measurements where vessel brightness exceeds that of the retinal background result in negative values of optical density, causing an artifactual increase in saturation. Optimization of model reflectance values produces a good fit of the conceptual model to measured ODRs.Conclusion: Measurement artefacts in retinal oximetry are caused by strong central vessel reflections, and apparent diameter sensitivity may result from single and double-pass transmission in vessels. Improvement in correction for vessel diameter is indicated for arteries however further study is necessary for venous corrections.

Here, we quantified DSB distribution and identified the importance of each DSB repair pathway at increasing depths within the carbon ion spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) beam range. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were irradiated in a single biological system capable of incorporating the full carbon ion SOBP beam range. Cytotoxicity and DSB distribution/repair kinetics were examined at increasing beam depths using cell survival as an endpoint and gamma-H2AX as a surrogate marker for DSBs. We observed that proximal SOBP had the highest number of total foci/cell and lowest survival, while distal SOBP had the most dense tracks. Both NHEJ- and HR-deficient CHO cells portrayed an increase in radiosensitivity throughout the full carbon beam range, although NHEJ-deficient cells were the most radiosensitive cell line from beam entrance up to proximal SOBP and demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in ability to repair DSBs. In contrast, HR-deficient cells had the greatest ratio of survival fraction at entrance depth to the lowest survival fraction within the SOBP and demonstrated a linear energy transfer (LET)-dependent decrease in ability to repair DSBs. Collectively, our results provide insight into treatment planning and potential targets to inhibit, as HR was a more beneficial pathway to inhibit than NHEJ to enhance the cell killing effect of CIRT in targeted tumor cells within the SOBP while maintaining limited unwanted damage to surrounding healthy cells. This is the first study to demonstrate that homologous recombination is the most beneficial pathway to inhibit over nonhomologous end joining to enhance the cell killing effect of carbon ion radiotherapy in the targeted tumor cells within the carbon ion spread-out Bragg peak.image	[Buglewicz, Dylan J.; Hirakawa, Hirokazu; Cuihua, Liu; Fang, Yaqun; Fujimori, Akira; Sai, Sei] Natl Inst Quantum Sci & Technol QST, Inst Quantum Med Sci, Dept Charged Particle Therapy Res, Chiba, Japan; [Buglewicz, Jessica K.

J	Greey, AD				Greey, Ali Durham			Boys, girls, and everyone else: Ontario public school board responses to gender diversity	CANADIAN REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SOCIOLOGIE			English	Article; Early Access							YOUTH; TRANSGENDER; POLICIES	Trans and nonbinary youth issue a challenge to K-12 schools, which regularly assume gender is binary and immutable. Although scholars have explored how educational institutions are responding to trans and nonbinary students, fewer have examined the assumptions implicit within these responses. By analyzing policy solutions as diagnostics of institutions' implicit representations of social problems, I examine how educational institutions construct the terms of membership for trans and nonbinary students. This article examines all publicly-available Ontario public school board documents (N = 359) including the terms "gender identity" and/or "gender expression." The findings show patterns in school board approaches. Roughly 80% of responses focus on a case-by-case, individual-level response. The remaining 20% adopt a systemic approach to trans and nonbinary inclusion. Few responses challenge binary-sorting practices. This article addresses the broader social issue of how public organizations deal with difference and the limits of individual accommodation responses to systemic inequity. Les jeunes transgenres et non binaires representent un defi pour les ecoles primaires et secondaires, qui partent regulierement du principe que le genre est binaire et immuable. Bien que les chercheurs aient explore la maniere dont les etablissements d'enseignement repondent aux etudiants transgenres et non binaires, ils sont moins nombreux a avoir examine les hypotheses implicites dans ces reponses. En analysant les solutions politiques comme des diagnostics des representations implicites des problemes sociaux par les institutions, j'examine comment les institutions educatives construisent les conditions d'appartenance des etudiants trans et non binaires. Cet article examine tous les documents des conseils scolaires publics de l'Ontario (N = 359) accessibles au public et comprenant les termes "identite de genre" et/ou "expression de genre". Les resultats montrent des tendances dans les approches des conseils scolaires. Environ 80 % des reponses se concentrent sur le cas par cas, au niveau individuel. Les 20 % restants adoptent une approche systemique de l'inclusion des personnes transgenres et non binaires. Peu de reponses remettent en cause les pratiques de tri binaire. Cet article aborde la question sociale plus large de la maniere dont les organisations publiques traitent la difference, et les limites des reponses individuelles a l'iniquite systemique.

Here, the configuration is explored consisting of silver (Ag) nanocube dimers positioned on Ag substrates to realize large Purcell enhancement of molecular spontaneous emission. The relationship is investigated between the cube sizes and separation gap of a nanocube dimer and the resulting Purcell enhancement, and shows the possibility of achieving the enhancement of up to 6.4 x 106. Furthermore, to experimentally demonstrate large Purcell enhancements, atomic force microscopy is used to assemble Ag nanocube dimers in the corner-to-corner configuration with the help of prefabricated corner-to-corner dielectric bricks. The decrease of the lifetime of Ru dye molecules from 91.7 ns (on a glass substrate) to the instrument response function limit (1.5 ns) after coupling with nanocube dimers is observed. This work provides a promising design and realization method for advanced photon sources, e.g., atom-like single-photon emitters with extremely large decay rates. Silver nanocube dimers are proposed to realize large Purcell enhancement of molecular spontaneous emission, showing the possibility for achieving an enhancement up to 6.4 x 106. The coupled system is experimentally realized with atomic force microscopy, and with the help of prefabricated dielectric brick dimers, showing large decay rare enhancement, which provides a promising design and realization method for single photon sources.image	[Kan, Yinhui; Bozhevolnyi, Sergey I.; Kumar, Shailesh] Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Nano Opt, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark	University of Southern Denmark	Bozhevolnyi, SI; Kumar, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Nano Opt, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.	seib@mci.sdu.dk; shku@mci.sdu.dk	Bozhevolnyi, Sergey/E-9423-2011	Bozhevolnyi, Sergey/0000-0002-0393-4859	The authors acknowledge the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62105150), European Unionamp;apos;s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklstrok;odowska-Curie Action (Grant agreement No. 10106 [62105150]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [101064471]; European Unionamp;apos;s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklstrok;odowska-Curie Action [BK20210289]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [2022GZKF023]; State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems Networks of China; Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation [35950]; Villum Experiment from Villum Fonden	The authors acknowledge the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62105150), European Unionamp;apos;s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklstrok;odowska-Curie Action (Grant agreement No. 10106; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); European Unionamp;apos;s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklstrok;odowska-Curie Action; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems Networks of China; Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation(Villum Fonden); Villum Experiment from Villum Fonden	The authors acknowledge the support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 62105150), European Union & apos;s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk & lstrok;odowska-Curie Action (Grant agreement No. 101064471), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20210289), State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems Networks of China (2022GZKF023), Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation (Award in Technical and Natural Sciences 2019), and Villum Experiment from Villum Fonden (Grant No. 35950).		46	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA		2511-9044		ADV QUANTUM TECHNOL	Adv.

Science and sacrifice: the pioneering journey of Dora Lush	IMMUNOLOGY AND CELL BIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						Dora Lush; immunology; typhus		In 1943, Australian scientist Miss Dora Lush's life was tragically cut short in her relentless pursuit of scientific knowledge. This article commemorates the 100-year anniversary of the journal, ICB, by celebrating the remarkable career of Lush, a renowned bacteriologist who achieved unparalleled success in an era when women faced formidable barriers to tertiary education and scientific recognition. Graduating with a Master of Science from the University of Melbourne in 1934, Lush's ground-breaking research in infectious diseases, conducted in collaboration with Frank Macfarlane Burnet AO at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI), played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of viruses, including influenza, herpes and myxomatosis. Lush's pivotal work on influenza provided the foundational evidence to develop the influenza vaccine, a cornerstone of global public health today. Similarly, her investigation of myxoma virus in rabbits, with its potential for pest control and ecological impact, was used to instruct creation of the world's first biological control program against a mammalian pest. Tragically, Dora Lush succumbed to scrub fever in 1943, a disease she contracted during a laboratory accident. Her unwavering commitment to science led her to offer her own blood for research as she battled the infection, exemplifying her dedication to advancing knowledge even in the face of personal adversity. Lush's legacy endures through scholarships and fellowships that bear her name in Australia, fostering the careers of aspiring scientists. Her ground-breaking research and unwavering determination continue to inspire generations, reminding us of the importance of diversity in science and the enduring impact of pioneering women like Lush.

However, low oxygen concentration due to inherent tumor hypoxia limits its catalytic effect. Herein, an injectable thermosensitive hydrogel system (named APH) is developed for co-loading of near-infrared (NIR) aggregation-induced emission (AIE) nanoparticles and plasma amine oxidase (PAO) for boosting carbonyl stress and enhancing antitumor immunity. Upon 808 nm NIR laser irradiation, the AIE nanoparticles trigger a mild-temperature (around 45 & DEG;C) photothermal effect in the tumor site, which significantly relieves tumor hypoxia and promotes the catalytic effect of released PAO to inhibit the growth of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Remarkably, the synergistic therapeutic effect of APH is verified through a significant inhibitory effect on the distant tumor, enhanced immune memory, and effective suppression of postoperative recurrence, rechallenge, and metastasis. Overall, the combined effect of AIE-mediated photothermal therapy and carbonyl stress by APH upon NIR irradiation therapy can significantly activate cancer immunotherapy, making it a promising treatment approach for cancer treatment. A synergistic strategy of combining mild photothermal therapy and carbonyl stress is accomplished by an AIE-based hydrogel system, which relieves tumor hypoxia and activated anti-tumor immunity. Remarkably, the induced cancer immunotherapy significantly inhibits distant tumor growth, enhances immune memory and suppresses postoperative recurrence, rechallenge and metastasis, making it a promising cancer treatment approach.image	[Pan, You; Jiang, Yi; Ning, Shipeng] Guangxi Med Univ, Dept Breast Surg, Affiliated Hosp 2, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Suo, Meng] Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Qinqin; Wang, Shile] Zhengzhou Univ, Acad Med Sci, Precis Med Ctr, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Meng] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Jinan Univ, Shenzhen Peoples Hosp, Affiliated Hosp 1,Clin Med Coll 2,Dept Gastrointes, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Meng] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Jinan Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Clin Med Coll 2,Dept Geriatr,Shenzhen Peoples Hosp, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Ning, Shipeng] TheSecond Affiliated Hosp Guangxi Med Univ, Dept Breast Surg, Nanning 530000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianfu] Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China	Guangxi Medical University; Guangzhou Medical University; Zhengzhou University; Southern University of Science & Technology; Jinan University; Jinan University; Southern University of Science & Technology; Guangzhou Medical University	Ning, SP (corresponding author), TheSecond Affiliated Hosp Guangxi Med Univ, Dept Breast Surg, Nanning 530000, Peoples R China.; Zhang, TF (corresponding author), Guangzhou Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 511436, Peoples R China.	nspdoctor@163.com; zhangtf@gzhmu.edu.cn			We are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82002779), the Guangxi Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 2023GXNSFBA026137, and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M710853).

Imaging and outcomes of fetal adrenal hemorrhage: A systematic review	PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS			English	Review; Early Access							SONOGRAPHIC DIAGNOSIS; TUMOR; MASS; ULTRASOUND	ObjectiveTo describe prenatal and postnatal imaging findings of fetal adrenal hemorrhage (FAH) and its associated perinatal outcomes, including frequency of postnatal surgical intervention.MethodA systematic literature review of seven electronic databases was conducted from inception until January 2022, with 2008 articles identified reporting prenatally identified fetal adrenal masses. Studies with confirmed FAH diagnosis were included. Quality and risk assessment were evaluated.ResultsThirty-five studies, including 102 FAH cases, were analyzed. FAH was commonly described as cystic (28/90, 31%), anechoic (25/90, 28%), or mixed echogenic (14/90, 16%) on ultrasound. Outcome data were available for 65 cases (64%) of FAH: 9% (6/65) resolved prenatally, 35% (23/65) resolved postnatally, 34% (22/65) regressed in size after birth, and 22% (14/65) persisted postnatally. Overall, 25% (16/65) of cases underwent postnatal surgical intervention. Neuroblastoma was suspected in all 16 surgical cases. Only one case (1/16, 6%) confirmed a cystic hematoma with microscopic islets of neuroblastoma in situ on pathology.ConclusionPrenatal diagnosis of FAH is challenging due to the significant heterogeneity of ultrasound findings. Final pathology did not support the need for surgical intervention. Persistent postnatal FAH warrants shared decision making for further management based on the clinical presentation. What is already known about this topic?There is a paucity of data to guide patient counseling regarding outcomes and management of fetal adrenal hemorrhage (FAH) identified prenatally.What does this study add?We demonstrate that FAH ultrasound findings vary, where most persist prenatally and the majority regress or resolve postnatally. FAH is rarely associated with neuroblastoma. The decision to pursue surgical intervention was reported in 25% of FAH cases and final pathology did not support the need for surgical intervention. Patient counseling of suspected prenatal FAH should emphasize the need for close prenatal and postnatal imaging follow-up.

In this procedure, the patient model has been considered as a Single-Input Single-Output system. However, the anesthesiologist introduces other medications, such as analgesics. Therefore, this contribution considers a closed-loop formulation with two drugs as input control variables: propofol as an anesthetic, and remifentanil as an analgesic. Then, through the mathematical model description, this paper introduces a multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) model predictive control (MPC) to regulate the deep of hypnosis (DOH) based on the co-administration of propofol and remifentanil. Since the control variables must be positive during the procedure, the MPC is formulated as a constrained optimization problem. Quadratic programming solves the optimization problem by designing and developing an exponential cost function, which allows the rapid convergence of the MPC optimization algorithm. Finally, the proposed MPC formulation is tested on 12 patients in silico, simulating a 60-min general surgery. The simulated results verify the performance of the proposed MPC.

Lievin-Le			A flow cytometry method for safe detection of bacterial viability	CYTOMETRY PART A			English	Article; Early Access						bacteria; flow cytometry - viability dye; health and safety; prevention	ENUMERATION; CELLS; LIVE	Flow cytometry is a relevant tool to meet the requirements of academic and industrial research projects aimed at estimating the features of a bacterial population (e.g., quantity, viability, activity). One of the remaining challenges is now the safe assessment of bacterial viability while minimizing the risks inherent to existing protocols. In our core facility at the Paris-Saclay University, we have addressed this issue with two objectives: measuring bacterial viability in biological samples and preventing bacterial contamination and chemical exposure of the staff and cytometers used on the platform. Here, we report the development of a protocol achieving these two objectives, including a viability labeling step before bacteria fixation, which removes the risk of biological exposure, and the decrease of the use of reagents such as propidium iodide (PI), which are dangerous for health (CMR: carcinogenic, mutagenic, and reprotoxic). For this purpose, we looked for a non-CMR viability dye that can irreversibly label dead bacteria before fixation procedures and maintain intense fluorescence after further staining. We decided to test on the bacteria, eFluor Fixable Viability dyes, which are usually used on eukaryotic cells. Since the bacteria had size and granularity characteristics very similar to those associated with flow cytometry background signals, a step of bacterial DNA labeling with SYTO or DRAQ5 was necessarily added to differentiate them from the background. Three marker combinations (viability-DNA) were tested on LSR Fortessa and validated on pure bacterial populations (Gram+, Gram-) and polybacterial cultures. Any of the three methods can be used and adapted to the needs of each project and allow users to adapt the combination according to the configuration of their cytometer. Having been tested on six bacterial populations, validated on two cytometers, and repeated at least two times in each evaluated condition, we consider this method reliable in the context of these conditions. The reliability of the results obtained in flow cytometry was successfully validated by applying this protocol to confocal microscopy, permeabilization, and also to follow cultures over time. This flow cytometry protocol for measuring bacterial viability under safer conditions also opens the prospect of its use for further bacterial characterization.

In the second approach, the separation parameters such as peak resolution and separation factors were evaluated to obtain a well-resolved chromatogram. The parameters of the said separation process were successfully modeled by dimensionless numbers of mass transfer of the analytes in the column; and post-fitting of mass transfer equations, high R2 was obtained suggesting successful development of the chromatographic process. Euclidean distances between the values of each chromatographic separation parameter and their respective ideal values; the defuzzified scores; findings of mass transfer study; and separation factors concomitantly established that the mobile phase of composition 1% acetic acid in HPLC water (A)-HPLC grade methanol (B) in gradient elution conditions (90% A-10% B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min could simultaneously quantify the three molecules (& mu;g) in button mushrooms with good resolution. The presence of the said biomolecules in the extract of button mushrooms was also confirmed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometer (MS). An artificial neural network model (high R2) was also developed for chromatographic users, which would allow accurate prediction of the chromatographic parameters by varying mobile phase composition and flow rates. This work endeavored to develop a high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for simultaneous quantification of three important biotherapeutic molecules, namely, L-tryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin, present in low amounts in agro-commodities. The findings of defuzzified scores, mass transfer studies, peak separation parameters, and Euclidean distances corroborated well; thus, it could be unambiguously concluded that the best resolved chromatographic separation method for simultaneous quantification of SER, TRYP, and MEL when present as a mixture of pure chemicals and also in agro-cum-food matrices, occurred with mobile phase of composition 1% acetic acid in HPLC water (A)-HPLC grade methanol (B) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min under gradient elution conditions (90% A-10% B). The chromatographic separation method developed in this work can be easily deployed to chromatographic users for large-scale sample analysis of a myriad of biological matrices housing the said biomolecules. The ANN predictive model was a good fit owing to its high R2 (0.99) value, implying the developed method to be robust and reliable.

Here, we aim to advance knowledge on the topic by studying moral decision-making and moral reasoning in a group of adolescents with TS and a group of healthy controls. Overall, we found higher endorsement (i.e. a greater 'yes' response rate) for utilitarian solutions of incidental and instrumental moral dilemmas in TS compared to controls. By contrast, we reported an overall higher tendency of TS individuals to apply principles described in the moral foundation questionnaire to establish whether something is morally right or wrong. Our results document intact moral reasoning in TS and suggest that a deficit in suppressing inappropriate behaviours and/or altered sense of agency might be responsible for their higher utilitarian moral decision-making.

Exploring the effect of dynamic bond placement in liquid crystal elastomers	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						click chemistry; disulfides; dynamic chemistry; liquid crystal elastomers; networks	SHAPE-MEMORY; POLYMERS; EXCHANGE; THERMO	Dynamic liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of polymer networks characterized by the inclusion of both liquid crystalline monomers and dynamic covalent bonds. The unique properties realized through the combination of these moieties has produced a plethora of stimuli-responsive materials to address a range of emerging technologies. While previous works have studied the incorporation of different dynamic bonds in LCEs, few (if any) have studied the effect of the specific placement of the dynamic bonds within an LCE network. A series of dynamic LCE networks were synthesized using a generalizable approach that employs a tandem thiol-ene/yne chemistry which allows the location of the dynamic disulfide bond to be varied while maintaining similar network characteristics. When probing these systems in the LC regime, the thermomechanical properties were found to be largely similar. It is not until elevated temperatures (160-180 degrees C) that differences in the relaxation activation energies of these systems begin to materialize based solely on differences in placement of the dynamic bond throughout the network. This work demonstrates that through intentional dynamic bond placement, stress relaxation times can be tuned without affecting the LCE character. This insight can help optimize future dynamic LCE designs and achieve shorter processing times. image	[Lindberg, Charlie A.; Ghimire, Elina; Chen, Chuqiao; Dolinski, Neil D.; Wang, Sihong; de Pablo, Juan J.; Rowan, Stuart J.] Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Mol Engn, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lee, Sean; Rowan, Stuart J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Chem, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Dennis, Joseph M.] US DEVCOM Army Res Lab, Sci Extreme Mat Div, Polymers Branch, Aberdeen, MD USA; [de Pablo, Juan J.; Rowan, Stuart J.] Argonne Natl Lab, Ctr Mol Engn, Lemont, IL USA	University of Chicago; University of Chicago; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Argonne National Laboratory	Rowan, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Pritzker Sch Mol Engn, 5640 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.	stuartrowan@uchicago.edu			Parts of this work were carried out at the Soft Matter Characterization Facility and the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC NSF DMR-2011854) at the University of Chicago.

The aim of our study was to identify circulating miRNAs potentially associated with the severity of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in three steps. We have screened by RNA sequencing for the miRNAs that were differentially expressed in sera of a small group of OI patients versus controls and then conducted a validation phase by RT-qPCR analysis of sera of a larger patient population. In the first phase of miROI, we found 79 miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed. We therefore selected 19 of them as the most relevant. In the second phase, we were able to validate the significant overexpression of 8 miRNAs in the larger OI group. Finally, we looked for a relationship between the level of variation of the validated miRNAs and the clinical characteristics of OI. We found a significant difference in the expression of two microRNAs in those patients with dentinogenesis imperfecta. After reviewing the literature, we found 6 of the 8 miRNAs already known to have a direct action on bone homeostasis. Furthermore, the use of a miRNA-gene interaction prediction model revealed a 100% probability of interaction between 2 of the 8 confirmed miRNAs and COL1A1 and/or COL1A2. This is the first study to establish the miRNA signature in OI, showing a significant modification of miRNA expression potentially involved in the regulation of genes involved in the physiopathology of OI.

In Scandinavia, e.g. in Garde, Sweden or Stykket and Bola, Norway, early Mesolithic images (e.g. rock carvings from before c.5000 BCE) often feature animals that are solitary or without suggestion of causal or narrative relations to other figures, although they sometimes are grouped by proximity or are superimposed on each other. Notable is also the almost complete absence of human figures. However, in subsequent Neolithic configurations (after c.5000 BCE), there are renderings of human agents involved in various forms of interaction with each other or with animals, often within distinguishable 'scenes' or compositions.In this paper we outline the emergence of pictorial narratives in Scandinavian rock carvings. In particular, we focus on some of the first depictions of human agency as displayed in Namforsen, Sweden (c.5000-1800 BCE). Further, we present an analysis of occurring human-animal relationships, interpretable as early attempts to create narrativizing images.

For the long term, the search for new DUV NLO crystals has focused on the alkali-metal inorganic acid salts where the variations of anionic groups are considered. Herein, another design strategy is reported, in which the alkali-metal cations are substituted by the asymmetrical non-& pi;-conjugated cations to harmonize the above mutual restrictions. Accordingly, LiN2H5SO4 (LNHSO) crystal is obtained by the substitution of [N2H5]+ for alkali-metal ions in LiMSO4 (M = Na, K, and Rb). Compared with LiMSO4 (M = Na, K, and Rb), LNHSO exhibits a moderate phase-matching second-harmonic generation response (0.6 x KH2PO4), increased birefringence (two to three times that of other sulfates), and the widest bandgap (7.69 eV) among all the reported NLO sulfates. The structural analysis and theoretical calculation reveal that the structural anisotropy, arrangement, and packing configuration of the novel NLO-active [N2H5]+ cation in LNHSO effectively promotes the optical properties and enlarges the bandgap. This work provides an innovative perspective for the rational design and synthesis of DUV NLO materials with excellent performance. A rational strategy for the asymmetrical non-& pi;-conjugated cation offers a new possibility for harmonizing the mutual restrictions of the deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials. As demonstrated by LiMSO4 (M = N2H5, Na, K, and Rb), the nonspherical deep energy-level orbitals of [N2H5] units directly lead the conduction band minimum of the LiN2H5SO4 crystal to shift upward, thus enlarging its bandgap and birefringence. image	[Zhu, Pengfei; Wang, Zhenyan; Jiang, Huatong; Zhao, Jianfu; Li, Chao; Duan, Xiulan; Yu, Fapeng] Shandong Univ, State Key Lab Crystal Mat, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Gong, Pifu; Lin, Zheshuai] Chinese Acad Sci, Tech Inst Phys & Chem, Funct Crystal Lab, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China	Shandong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry, CAS	Duan, XL (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, State Key Lab Crystal Mat, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Lin, ZS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Tech Inst Phys & Chem, Funct Crystal Lab, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.	zslin@mail.ipc.ac.cn; xlduan@sdu.edu.cn			P.F.Z. and P.F.G. contributed equally to this work.

Although it is considered a reliable and safe technique for both mothers and fetuses, unexpected high or low levels of block may occur due to accidental injection of these agents into different meningeal spaces other than intended. Hypotension, bradycardia, headache, and failed anesthesia are common complications of spinal anesthesia. Though rare, neurological complications like aphonia, dysphagia, and tingling sensation have also been reported. The article reports a case of a 22-year-old primigravida who sustained transient aphonia following intrathecal administration of bupivacaine for an emergency cesarian section for meconium-stained liquor with fetal distress. There were no other neurological manifestations or features suggestive of high spinal block. The sensory level of the block was fixed to T6 with hemodynamic stability throughout aphasia with an episode of hypotension preceding aphonia.

The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, Arc, functions in the nucleus accumbens shell to limit multiple triggers of cocaine-seeking behaviour	ADDICTION BIOLOGY			English	Article						Arc/Arg3.1; cocaine; cue-induced reinstatement; self-administration	CUE-INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; UP-REGULATION; PRELIMBIC CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNA; EXPRESSION; ARC/ARG3.1	Use of addictive substances like cocaine produces enduring associations between the drug experience and cues in the drug-taking environment. In individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) and attempting to remain abstinent, these powerful drug-cue associations can trigger a return to active drug use, but the molecular mechanisms regulating drug-cue associations remain poorly understood. The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is induced by cocaine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important brain reward region, but Arc's NAc function in SUD-related behaviour remains unclear. We show here that cocaine self-administration (SA) in rats produced a significant upregulation of Arc protein in both the core and shell subregions of the NAc. Subregion-specific Arc reduction (shRNA) in the medial NAc Shell enhanced both context-associated and cue-reinstated cocaine seeking, but without altering the motivation to work for cocaine, the sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of cocaine or the ability of cocaine priming to reinstate drug seeking. In contrast, we observed no effects of Arc knockdown in the NAc core on any aspect of cocaine SA, extinction or reinstated cocaine seeking, suggesting that Arc functions within the medial NAc shell, but not NAc core, to limit the strength of drug-context and drug-cue associations that promote cocaine-seeking behaviour. The levels of the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) are increased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell subregions during cocaine intravenous self-administration. Viral-mediated reduction of Arc in the NAc medial shell, but not NAc core, of adult male rats has no effects on active cocaine taking, but it augments context-associated and cue-reinstated cocaine seeking. These findings suggest that Arc limits future cocaine-seeking behaviour in a NAc subregion-specific manner.image	[Barry, Sarah M.; Barry, Gabriella M.; Martinez, Dalia; Penrod, Rachel D.; Cowan, Christopher W.] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Neurosci, Charleston, SC USA; [Penrod, Rachel D.; Cowan, Christopher W.] Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Neurosci, 173 Ashley Ave,BSB 403,MSC 510, Charleston, SC 29425 USA	Medical University of South Carolina; Medical University of South Carolina	Penrod, RD; Cowan, CW (corresponding author), Med Univ South Carolina, Dept Neurosci, 173 Ashley Ave,BSB 403,MSC 510, Charleston, SC 29425 USA.	penrodam@musc.edu; cowanc@musc.edu			We thank Monica Witcher, Ben Zirlin, Emilia Pulver and Yuhong Guo for excellent animal care and behavioural assistance.

However, the structural details of how the two monomers interact upon binding of substrates is not well understood and the structure of the ligand-free state of the hGSTA1-1 homodimer has not been resolved. Here, we used a combination of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance measurements and weighted ensemble (WE) simulations to characterize the conformational ensemble of the ligand-free state at the atomic level. EPR measurements reveal a broad distance distribution between a pair of Cu(II) labels in the ligand-free state that gradually shifts and narrows as a function of increasing ligand concentration. These shifts suggest changes in the relative positioning of the two a9 helices upon ligand binding. WE simulations generated unbiased pathways for the seconds-timescale transition between alternate states of the enzyme, leading to the generation of atomically detailed structures of the ligand-free state. Notably, the simulations provide direct observations of negative cooperativity between the monomers of hGSTA1-1, which involve the mutually exclusive docking of a9 in each monomer as a lid over the active site. We identify key interactions between residues that lead to this negative cooperativity. Negative cooperativity may be essential for interaction of hGSTA1-1 with a wide variety of toxic substrates and their subsequent neutralization. More broadly, this work demonstrates the power of integrating EPR distances with WE rare-events sampling strategy to gain mechanistic information on protein function at the atomic level.

Evidences of the relationships between serum lipids and cognitive impairment are inconsistent or equivocal among older adults. This study aimed to investigate the associations between lipid profiles and late-life cognitive impairment among oldest-old and centenarian adults. In this cross-sectional study, serum lipids were biochemically measured among 606 oldest-old adults and 653 centenarians, and cognitive function was evaluated using mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the associations between serum lipids and cognitive impairment. Results showed participants with cognitive impairment had lower total cholesterol (TC) levels compared with those without cognitive impairment (p < 0.05). TC levels were positively associated with MMSE (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a negative association was observed between TC levels and cognitive impairment (p for trend = 0.002). This negative association remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounders (p for trend = 0.028). These results suggested that older adults with higher TC levels were likely to have better cognitive function. Taking immoderate cholesterol-lowering drugs among older adults is questionable and requires investigation, and cognitive performance of old adults with lower TC levels deserves more attention.

In this paper, a site-specific peptide bond relaxation mechanism by deuterons whose localization has been suggested by neutron crystallography is proposed. Such deuteron was observed as an arm of neutron scattering length density protruding from the carbonyl oxygen atoms in the main chain in the omit map drawn by neutron crystallography of human lysozyme. Our comprehensive study using x-ray and neutron diffraction and 15N chemical shifts of individual amide nitrogen atoms within the same peptide bond strongly suggests the relaxation of the electronic resonance structure because of site-specific modulation by protons/deuterons localized on the electron orbital of the carbonyl oxygen. All experimental data used in this examination were obtained at room temperature, which is preferable for enzymatic activity. Such a close interaction between the electron resonance structure of a peptide bond and the exchangeable protons/deuterons well agreed with that observed in an intermediate state in an amide hydrolytic reaction simulated by the ab-initio calculation including water molecules.

Differential regulation of MAP2 by phosphorylation events in proline-rich versus C-terminal domains	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						actin; cytoskeleton; microtubule-associated proteins; microtubules; mutagenesis; neurobiology	MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS; TAU-PHOSPHORYLATION; DYNAMIC INSTABILITY; ACTIN-FILAMENTS; KINASE-A; TUBULIN; POLYMERIZATION; BINDING; ACTIVATION; KINETICS	MAP2 is a critical cytoskeletal regulator in neurons. The phosphorylation of MAP2 (MAP2-P) is well known to regulate core functions of MAP2, including microtubule (MT)/actin binding and facilitation of tubulin polymerization. However, site-specific studies of MAP2-P function in regions outside of the MT-binding domain (MTBD) are lacking. We previously identified a set of MAP2 phosphopeptides which are differentially expressed and predominantly increased in the cortex of individuals with schizophrenia relative to nonpsychiatric comparison subjects. The phosphopeptides originated not from the MTBD, but from the flanking proline-rich and C-terminal domains of MAP2. We sought to understand the contribution of MAP2-P at these sites on MAP2 function. To this end, we isolated a series of phosphomimetic MAP2C constructs and subjected them to cell-free tubulin polymerization, MT-binding, actin-binding, and actin polymerization assays. A subset of MAP2-P events significantly impaired these functions, with the two domains displaying different patterns of MAP2 regulation: proline-rich domain mutants T293E and T300E impaired MT assembly and actin-binding affinity but did not affect MT-binding, while C-terminal domain mutants S426E and S439D impaired all three functions. S443D also impaired MT assembly with minimal effects on MT- or actin-binding. Using heterologous cells, we also found that S426E but not T293E had a lower capability for process formation than the wild-type protein. These findings demonstrate the functional utility of MAP2-P in the proline-rich and C-terminal domains and point to distinct, domain-dependent regulations of MAP2 function, which can go on to affect cellular morphology.

A geometric morphometric analysis of variation in Australian frog ilia and taxonomic interpretations	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Amphibia; Australia; frog; geometric morphometrics; ilium; palaeontology	GENERAL COEFFICIENT; ANURA; PLEISTOCENE; MORPHOLOGY; PHYLOGENY; CLASSIFICATION; SIMILARITY; FITZINGER; AMPHIBIA; PATTERNS	Anurans including frogs and toads exhibit an ilium that is often regarded as taxonomically diagnostic. The ilium, one of the three paired bones that make up the pelvic girdle, has been important in the fossil record for identifying anuran morphotypes. Osteological collections for Australian frogs are rare in herpetological museums, and skeletonizing whole-bodied specimens requires destroying soft tissue morphology which is valuable to anuran specialists working on living species. Computed tomography scans provide the opportunity to study anuran osteology without the loss of soft tissues. Our study, based on microcomputed tomography scans of extant Australian frogs from the public repository Morphosource and from museum collections focuses on the morphological differences between Australian frogs at the familial and generic levels using geometric morphometrics to compare the diagnostic shape of the ilium. Principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical variate analysis (CVA) were conducted to assess differences in the ilium between supraspecific groups of Australian frogs. The canonical variates analysis accurately predicted group membership (i.e., the correct family) with up to 76.2% success for cross-validated predictions and 100% of original group predictions. While the sample was limited to familial and generic level analyses, our research shows that ilial morphology in Australian frogs is taxonomically informative. This research provides a guide for identifying Australian anurans, including fossils, as well as new information relevant to considerations about their phylogenetic relationships, and the potential use of the fossil record to enhance efforts to conserve threatened living frog species.

This study aimed to explore the associations between the temporal properties of dFC and memory performance in betel quid dependence (BQD). Sixty-four BQD individuals and 47 gender- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and a series of neuropsychological assessments. The dFC was constructed by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficients within a sliding window and was clustered into three functional connectivity states using k-means clustering. The dFC temporal properties derived from the cluster results were compared between the BQD and HC groups. The results showed that States 1 and 3 featured more frequent and weak connectivity, and State 2 featured less frequent and strong connectivity. There were significant differences for mean dwell time (MDT) in State 3 (p = 0.022) and fraction of time in State 2 (p = 0.018) between the BQD and HC groups. Pearson correlation analyses showed that the MDT in State 1 was negatively correlated with long delay free recall and short delay free recall, and the MDT in State 3 was positively correlated with false positive of long delay recall. Our findings provide strong evidence that MDT match the memory performance and suggest new insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of memory disorders in BQD individuals. There were significant differences for MDT in State 3 and fraction of time in State 2 between the BQD and HC groups. BQD group showed a significantly longer mean dwell time (MDT) in State 3 and a shorter fraction of time in State 2 compared to the HC group.image	[Guo, Yihao; Xu, Xiaoling; Li, Tiansheng; Chen, Huijuan; Wang, Xiaoyi; Huang, Weiyuan; Chen, Feng] Hainan Med Univ, Hainan Affiliated Hosp, Hainan Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tao] Hainan Med Univ, Hainan Gen Hosp, Hainan Affiliated Hosp, Dept Geriatr Ctr, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China; [Kong, Qingle] Siemens Healthineers Ltd, MR Collaborat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feng] Hainan Med Univ, Hainan Gen Hosp, Hainan Affiliated Hosp, Dept Radiol, 19,Xiuhua St, Haikou 570311, Hainan, Peoples R China	Hainan Medical University; Hainan Medical University; Hainan Medical University	Chen, F (corresponding author), Hainan Med Univ, Hainan Gen Hosp, Hainan Affiliated Hosp, Dept Radiol, 19,Xiuhua St, Haikou 570311, Hainan, Peoples R China.	fenger0802@163.com			This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 82160327 for T.L. and Grant Nos. 81971602 and 82271977 for F.C.), the Key Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province (ZDYF2021SHFZ239 for F.C. and ZDYF2023SHFZ [82160327, 81971602, 82271977]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [ZDYF2021SHFZ239, ZDYF2023SHFZ096]; Key Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province; Hainan Academician Innovation Platform Fund; Hainan Province Clinical Medical Center [JBGS202107, JBG202113]; Natural Science Research Project of Hainan Medical University	This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 82160327 for T.L. and Grant Nos. 81971602 and 82271977 for F.C.), the Key Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province (ZDYF2021SHFZ239 for F.C. and ZDYF2023SHFZ; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province; Hainan Academician Innovation Platform Fund; Hainan Province Clinical Medical Center; Natural Science Research Project of Hainan Medical University	We thank all volunteers for their participation.r This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 82160327 for T.L. and Grant Nos. 81971602 and 82271977 for F.C.), the Key Science and Technology Project of Hainan Province (ZDYF2021SHFZ239 for F.C. and ZDYF2023SHFZ096 for T.L.), the Hainan Academician Innovation Platform Fund, the Hainan Province Clinical Medical Center, and the Natural Science Research Project of Hainan Medical University (Grant No. JBGS202107 for F.C., Grant No. JBG202113 for W.H.).		45	0	0	3	3	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1355-6215	1369-1600		ADDICT BIOL	Addict.

Assessment of refeeding syndrome definitions and 30-day mortality in critically ill adults: A comparison study	JOURNAL OF PARENTERAL AND ENTERAL NUTRITION			English	Article; Early Access						hypokalemia; hypophosphatemia; nutrition; refeeding syndrome	HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA; NUTRITION	BackgroundPatients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are at high risk for refeeding syndrome (RFS), yet there is uncertainty regarding how RFS should be operationalized in the ICU. We evaluated different definitions for RFS and tested how they associated with patient-centered outcomes in the ICU.MethodsThis was a retrospective comparison study. Patients age >= 18 years were eligible if they were newly initiated on enteral feeding while hospitalized in the ICU. Eight definitions for RFS were operationalized, including that from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), all based on electrolyte levels from immediately before until up to 5 days after the initiation of enteral nutrition. Patients were followed for death or for ICU-free days, a measure of healthcare utilization.ResultsIn all, 2123 patients were identified, including 406 (19.1%) who died within 30 days of ICU admission and 1717 (80.9%) who did not. Prevalence of RFS varied from 1.5% to 88% (ASPEN definition) depending on the RFS definition used. The excess risk for death associated with RFS varied from 33% to 92% across definitions. The development of RFS based on the ASPEN definition was associated with a greater decrease in ICU-free days compared with other definitions, but the relationship was not statistically significant.ConclusionEight definitions for RFS were evaluated, none of which showed strong associations with death or ICU-free days. It may be challenging to achieve a standardized definition for RFS that is based on electrolyte values and predicts mortality or ICU-free days.

Does sound unpleasantness modulate the mismatch negativity and its habituation?	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						arousal; aversive sounds; emotion; event-related potential; mismatch negativity	CIRCUMPLEX MODEL; VALENCE; REPETITION; ATTENTION; AROUSAL; EXPRESSIONS; DEVIANT	There are sounds that most people perceive as highly unpleasant, for instance, the sound of rubbing pieces of polystyrene together. Previous research showed larger physiological and neural responses for such aversive compared to neutral sounds. Hitherto, it remains unclear whether habituation, i.e., diminished responses to repeated stimulus presentation, which is typically reported for neutral sounds, occurs to the same extent for aversive stimuli. We measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) in response to rare occurrences of aversive or neutral deviant sounds within an auditory oddball sequence in 24 healthy participants, while they performed a demanding visual distractor task. Deviants occurred as single events (i.e., between two standards) or as double deviants (i.e., repeating the identical deviant sound in two consecutive trials). All deviants elicited a clear MMN, and amplitudes were larger for aversive than for neutral deviants (irrespective of their position within a deviant pair). This supports the claim of preattentive emotion evaluation during early auditory processing. In contrast to our expectations, MMN amplitudes did not show habituation, but increased in response to deviant repetition-similarly for aversive and neutral deviants. A more fine-grained analysis of individual MMN amplitudes in relation to individual arousal and valence ratings of each sound item revealed that stimulus-specific MMN amplitudes were best predicted by the interaction of deviant position and perceived arousal, but not by valence. Deviants with perceived higher arousal elicited larger MMN amplitudes only at the first deviant position, indicating that the MMN reflects preattentive processing of the emotional content of sounds. We assessed brain responses to unexpected and repeated aversive and neutral environmental sounds and their habituation characteristics. Our finding of a larger mismatch negativity (MMN) response to aversive as compared to neutral sounds suggests rapid and ongoing emotional evaluation that might gate sensory processing. We did not observe any MMN habituation. Interestingly, our data reveal that the MMN amplification for aversive sounds is mainly linked to their perceived arousal, especially when they occur unexpectedly.

For their practical applications excellent mechanical properties and electrochemical performance are required simultaneously, which remains a grand challenge. In this study, we present a new scalable and low-cost design, which uses a quasi-solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) to achieve both remarkably improved flexural properties and attractive energy density. The QSPE has a high ionic conductivity of 1.2 mS cm(-1) and retains 91% capacity over 500 cycles in graphite/NMC532 cells. Moreover, the resulting structural batteries achieved a modulus of 21.7 GPa and a specific energy of 127 Wh kg(-1 )based on the total cell weight, which to our knowledge is the highest reported value above 15 GPa. We further demonstrate the application of such structural batteries in a model electric car. The presented design concept enables the industrialization of structural batteries in electric transportation and further applications to improve energy efficiency and multifunctionality.image	[Singer, Gerald; Jin, Tianwei; Yang, Yuan] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, Program Mat Sci & Engn, New York, NY USA; [Hsieh, Cheng-Tien] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem Engn, New York, NY USA; [Lee, Seung Hoon] Columbia Univ, Dept Mech Engn, New York, NY USA; [Yang, Yuan] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, Program Mat Sci & Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA	Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University	Yang, Y (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math, Program Mat Sci & Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.	yy2664@columbia.edu			Gerald Singer acknowledges the support from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [J-4476-N].

Although Lys48-linked polyubiquitin, a multi-domain protein, is also known to be cyclized in human cells, the structural effects of cyclization remain unclear. Here, we examined the impact of cyclization on the structural stability and dynamics of cyclic Lys48-linked diubiquitin (Ub(2)). As expected, cyclization increased the thermal stability of Ub(2) and its resistance to proteolytic digestion, indicating that cyclization stabilized the structure of Ub(2). Furthermore, cyclization repressed the interdomain motion in Ub(2), but cyclic Ub(2) still exhibited microsecond conformational exchange in NMR relaxation dispersion experiments. A series of long coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations visualized how cyclization slowed down the intrinsic nanosecond open-closed domain motion of Ub(2) to microseconds. Thus, CG-MD analysis helped to explain the unexpected NMR relaxation results, thereby facilitating characterization of the structural stabilization of cyclic Ub(2).

However, the mechanism by which the gut microbiota influences dietary protein metabolism and its corresponding effect on the host physiology is poorly understood. Enteropeptidase inhibitors block host protein digestion and reduce body weight gain in diet-induced obese rats and mice, and therefore they constitute a new class of drugs for targeting metabolic diseases. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are dispersed throughout the gut and possess the ability to sense dietary proteins and protein-derived metabolites. Despite this, it remains unclear if enteropeptidase inhibition affects EECs function. In this study, we fed conventional and antibiotic treated mice a western style diet (WSD) supplemented with an enteropeptidase inhibitor (WSD-ETPi), analyzed the expression of gut hormones along the length of the intestine, and measured small intestinal transit under different conditions. The ETPi-supplemented diet promoted higher Gcg expression in the colon and increased circulating Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels, but only in the microbiota-depleted mice. The increase in GLP-1 levels resulted in slower small intestinal transit, which was subsequently reversed by administration of GLP-1 receptor antagonist. Interestingly, small intestinal transit was normalized when an amino acid-derived microbial metabolite, p-cresol, was supplemented along with WSD-ETPi diet, primarily attributed to the reduction of colonic Gcg expression. Collectively, our data suggest that microbial dietary protein metabolism plays an important role in host physiology by regulating GLP-1-mediated intestinal transit.

CLINICAL CASE REPORTS			English	Article						angioscopy; deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; tumor thrombus		Key clinical messageContrast defects in veins are often diagnosed as benign thrombi, but depending on the patient's background it is necessary to differentiate between tumor thrombi. It is difficult to differentiate between these using contrast-enhanced CT alone, but with angioscopy it is easy to visually distinguish between a benign and tumor thrombi.AbstractContrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) performed on a male patient being treated for de-differentiated chondrosarcoma revealed contrast defects in the pulmonary artery and right femoral vein, and a diagnosis of pulmonary artery thromboembolism and venous thromboembolism was made, and oral anticoagulant therapy was started. However, a follow-up CT showed that the contrast defect had extended to the inferior vena cava. Observation using an angioscope revealed that it was not a benign thrombi but a tumor. A contrast defect was observed in inferior vena cava (IVC) of a 61-year-old male patient with de-differentiated chondrosarcoma, but it was not possible to distinguish whether it was a thrombus or a tumor. Using an angioscope, he was able to clearly diagnose a tumor.image	[Wakasa, Shiho; Hayashi, Hiroya; Yamazaki, Takanori; Izumiya, Yasuhiro; Fukuda, Daiju] Osaka Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, 1-4-3 Asahimachi, Abenoku, Osaka 5458585, Japan		Yamazaki, T (corresponding author), Osaka Metropolitan Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Med, 1-4-3 Asahimachi, Abenoku, Osaka 5458585, Japan.	zakitaka0614@yahoo.co.jp		Yamazaki, Takanori/0000-0003-3542-3559	Cardiovascular Research Fund	Cardiovascular Research Fund	The Cardiovascular Research Fund		3	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2050-0904			CLIN CASE REP	Clin.

At presentation, the gelding was alert with mild tachycardia (60 beats/min). Other physical findings were normal except for a mass detected in the area of the left kidney on rectal palpation. Laboratory analyses revealed anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia consistent with haemorrhage and haemolysis. Transabdominal ultrasonography revealed the left kidney to be an enlarged heterogenous mass, and numerous 1-2 cm diameter hyperechoic nodules (without shadow artefacts) were imaged within the right kidney. After inconclusive results were returned on percutaneous biopsy of the left renal mass, a right renal biopsy yielded a diagnosis of haemangiosarcoma. Palliative care was initiated with dexamethasone, but 19 days after hospital discharge the gelding became recumbent, and humane euthanasia was performed. Necropsy examination confirmed disseminated haemangiosarcoma including both kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, heart and lungs with the largest neoplasm in the left kidney.

Forkhead box protein O6 (FoxO6) is a key transcription factor involved in many biological processes. This study aimed to explore the role of FoxO6 in cardiac hypertrophy. Three groups of mice were established: wild-type, FoxO6 knockout, and FoxO6-overexpressing. The mice received daily administration of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) or saline for 4 weeks, after which they were examined for cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and function. Elevated cardiac expression of FoxO6 was observed in Ang-II-treated mice. FoxO6 deficiency attenuated contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodeling, including cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. Conversely, FoxO6 overexpression aggravated the cardiomyopathy and heart dysfunction. Further studies identified kinesin family member 15 (Kif15) as downstream molecule of FoxO6. Kif15 inhibition attenuated the aggravating effect of FoxO6 overexpression. In vitro, FoxO6 overexpression increased Kif15 expression in cardiomyocytes and elevated the concentration of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the medium where fibroblasts were grown, exhibiting increased proliferation and differentiation, while FoxO6 knockdown attenuated this effect. Cardiac-derived FoxO6 promoted pathological cardiac remodeling induced by aggravated afterload largely by activating the Kif15/TGF-beta 1 axis. This result further complements the mechanisms of communication among different cells in the heart, providing novel therapeutic targets for heart failure.

This study was based on epigenetic alterations and immune cell infiltration analysis to investigate the mechanism of CD3D methylation in uveal melanoma (UM). Bioinformatics analysis was performed on transcriptome data, 450 K methylation data, and clinical information of UM patients from the TCGA database. Stromal and immune cell infiltration was evaluated by calculating the StromalScore and ImmuneScore of UM samples. UM samples were divided into high and low StromalScore and ImmuneScore groups, followed by differential and enrichment analyses. PPI network construction and correlation analysis was used to identify the core prognosis-related genes. The bioinformatics analysis results were confirmed in UM cell experiments. StromalScore and ImmuneScore were significantly associated with the prognosis of UM patients. CD3D, IRF1, CCL3, and FN1 were identified as core genes driven by methylation that affected the prognosis of UM patients. CD3D expression showed the highest correlation with its methylation and was closely related to the four key immune cells in UM development. CD3D was hypomethylated and abundantly expressed in UM cells, while silencing of CD3D inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of UM cells in vitro. In summary, this study identifies hypomethylation of CD3D promoter in UM, which was associated with immune cell infiltration of UM.

Prestin-based OHC electromotility improves cochlear frequency selectivity and sensitivity. Cochlear amplification determines the frequency coding wherein discrete sound frequencies find a 'best' place along the cochlear length. Loss of OHC is the leading cause of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss and compromised speech perception. Lipid interaction with Prestin impacts OHC function. It has been established that high-fat diet (HFD) is associated with ARHL. To determine whether genetic background and metabolism preserve cochlear frequency place coding, we examined the effect of HFD in C57BL/6J (B6) and CBA/CaJ (CBA) on ARHL.We found a significant rescuing effect on ARHL in aged B6 HFD cohort. Prestin levels and cell sizes were better maintained in the experimental B6-HFD group. We also found that distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) group delay measurement was preserved, which suggested stable frequency place coding. In contrast, the response to HFD in the CBA cohort was modest with no appreciable benefit to hearing threshold. Notably, group delay was shortened with age along with the control. In addition, the frequency dependent OHC nonlinear capacitance gradient was most pronounced at young age but decreased with age. Cochlear RNA-seq analysis revealed differential TRPV1 expression and lipid homeostasis. Activation of TRPV1 and downregulation of arachidonic acid led to downregulation of inflammatory response in B6 HFD, which protects the cochlea from ARHL. The genetic background and metabolic state-derived changes in OHC morphology and function collectively contribute to a redefined cochlear frequency place coding and improved age-related pitch perception.

Participants comprised 100 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 13.79 years, SD = 1.06). The stimuli consisted of happy, neutral, and sad facial expressions, which were manipulated to have different lip or eye colors. Participants reacted to the images by indicating their perceived emotion. Performance speed and accuracy were assessed during the experiment. Results indicated that for happy and neutral expressions, the use of color significantly reduced reaction times, while the accuracy remained unchanged. Conversely, for sad expressions, reaction time was not affected by color, but all color categories exhibited reduced accuracy. Facial expression image samples (blurred version) included (A) pink mouth (original neutral face), (B) blue mouth (neutral face), (C) orange mouth (neutral face), (D) purple mouth (neutral face), (E) red mouth (neutral face), (F) brown eyes (original sad face), (G) blue eyes (sad face), (H) green eyes (sad face), and (I) red eyes (sad face).

Ethical challenges in research on sexual dysfunction	BIOETHICS			English	Article; Early Access						ethics of research on sexual dysfunction; research ethics; sexuality research		Despite more than a century of research on sexual dysfunction, there has been limited attention to ethical concerns. This is problematic because sex research involves complex ethical questions that generate confusion for ethics review and have not been addressed by ethical guidelines. We analyze two questions. First, does sexual content raise the risk profile of a research protocol? We argue that there is nothing inherent in sexual content that makes a study high risk and that many sexual dysfunction studies involve no more than minimal risk. Second, we ask whether research interventions that involve seeing participants undressed or having physical contact with a research subject are permissible? We argue that these interventions raise an important ethical challenge-they often involve sexual dysfunction researchers engaging in interventions that would not be conducted in their standard practice. To resolve this, we propose an expertise-based account of the permissibility of sexual dysfunction research.

Traditional cell lines and mice models cannot recapitulate the human tumor biology and tumor microenvironment (TME). Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are freshly derived from patients' tissues and are then cultured with extracellular matrix and conditioned medium. The high concordance of epigenetic, genomic, and proteomic landscapes between the parental tumors and PDOs suggests that PDOs can provide more reliable results in studying cancer biology, allowing high throughput drug screening, and identifying their associated signaling pathways and resistance mechanisms. However, despite having a heterogeneity of cells in PDOs, some cells in TME will be lost during the culture process. Next-generation organoids have been developed to circumvent some of the limitations. Genetically engineered organoids involving targeted gene editing can facilitate the understanding of tumorigenesis and drug response. Co-culture systems where PDOs are cultured with different cell components like immune cells can allow research using immunotherapy which is otherwise impossible in conventional cell lines. In this review, the limitations of the traditional in vitro and in vivo assays, the use of PDOs, the challenges including some tips and tricks of PDO generation in EOC, and the future perspectives, will be discussed. Flat cultures using cell lines and mice models have been used for decades in preclinical cancer research. In recent years, PDOs have revolutionized the field of cancer research as this model can be regarded as a surrogate between mice and human beings and it can recapitulate the tumor features.

Hyperacute autonomic and cortical function recovery following cardiac arrest resuscitation in a rodent model	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							GLOBAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; BRAIN-INJURY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; BURST-SUPPRESSION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; PROGNOSTICATION; HYPOTHERMIA	Objective: There is a complex interaction between nervous and cardiovascular systems, but sparse data exist on brain-heart electrophysiological responses to cardiac arrest resuscitation. Our aim was to investigate dynamic changes in autonomic and cortical function during hyperacute stage post-resuscitation. Methods: Ten rats were resuscitated from 7-min cardiac arrest, as indicators of autonomic response, heart rate (HR), and its variability (HRV) were measured. HR was monitored through continuous electrocardiography, while HRV was assessed via spectral analysis, whereby the ratio of low-/high-frequency (LF/HF) power indicates the balance between sympathetic/parasympathetic activities. Cortical response was evaluated by continuous electroencephalography and quantitative analysis. Parameters were quantified at 5-min intervals over the first-hour post-resuscitation. Neurological outcome was assessed by Neurological Deficit Score (NDS, range 0-80, higher = better outcomes) at 4-h post-resuscitation. Results: A significant increase in HR was noted over 15-30 min post-resuscitation (p < 0.01 vs.15-min, respectively) and correlated with higher NDS (rs = 0.56, p < 0.01). LF/HF ratio over 15-20 min was positively correlated with NDS (rs = 0.75, p < 0.05). Gamma band power surged over 15-30 min post-resuscitation (p < 0.05 vs. 0-15 min, respectively), and gamma band fraction during this period was associated with NDS (rs >= 0.70, p < 0.05, respectively). Significant correlations were identified between increased HR and gamma band power during 15-30 min (rs >= 0.83, p < 0.01, respectively) and between gamma band fraction and LF/HF ratio over 15-20 min post-resuscitation (rs = 0.85, p < 0.01).Interpretations: Hyperacute recovery of autonomic and cortical function is associated with favorable functional outcomes. While this observation needs further validation, it presents a translational opportunity for better autonomic and neurologic monitoring during early periods post-resuscitation to develop novel interventions.

A retrospective, single-center case series	HEMODIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						acute kidney injury; drugs and dialysis; patient safety; pharmacology		Introduction: Metformin is widely considered a first-line antiglycemic agent due to its cost-effectiveness and favorable adverse effect profile. However, its use is prohibited in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), due to the risk of potentially lethal metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). We sought to evaluate MALA cases and outcomes at our institution.Methods: In this observational, retrospective case series, we reviewed our EMR for all patients who had a metformin level drawn between January 2013 and May 2022 to identify individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for MALA. We evaluated risk factors for MALA, the relationship between metformin level, blood pH, serum bicarbonate, and lactate level and clinical outcomes of ventilator dependency, renal replacement therapy requirement, renal recovery in acute kidney injury (AKI) patients, and survival.Findings: A total of 107 patients had metformin levels drawn, of which 19 patients met the diagnostic criteria for MALA. In our case series, MALA was primarily seen in AKI (15 patients) secondary to dehydration and sepsis, followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (4 patients). Intubation was required in 17 patients, of whom 8 were successfully extubated after a mean duration of 14 days. Sixteen patients received renal replacement therapy (RRT). Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) was performed in nine, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in four, and sequential therapy of IHD and CRRT in three patients. Seven patients, all in the AKI group (46.7%), died while all ESRD patients survived, accounting for an overall mortality rate of 36.8%. Among the eight surviving AKI patients, four had complete renal recovery with renal function returning to baseline, three had partial renal recovery, and one continued to require IHD at the time of discharge to a rehabilitation facility.Discussion: MALA may be an underrecognized entity. A high level of clinical suspicion leading to prompt and aggressive treatment with RRT may improve mortality rates. Provider and patient education is of paramount importance for safe use of metformin.	[Kim, Susan; Yee, Xin Tan; Fraga, Sebastian A.

However, there is no consensus on the optimal dose of OAs. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of OAs in preventing SSIs and the possibility that OAs induce enterobacterial alteration in the intestinal tract.MethodWe performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 389 patients who underwent R0 resection and stoma creation for colorectal cancer in our department between 2009 and 2020. We focused on the incidence of peristomal candidiasis (PSC) as an indicator of enterobacterial alteration and used kanamycin (KM) and metronidazole (MNZ) as the OAs. A low-dose group received 1000 mg/day of both KM and MNZ, and a high-dose group received 2000 mg/day of both KM and MNZ.ResultsSSI occurred in 60 of the 389 cases (15.4%). Regardless of stoma type, SSI was significantly more common in the non-OA group, while PSC was significantly less common. When examined by OA dose, the incidence of SSI was not significantly different between the low-dose and high-dose groups. However, PSC was significantly more common in the high-dose group than in the non-OA and low-dose groups. Analysis of bacterial and fungal levels in stool samples showed that bacterial levels after OAs were significantly lower than before OAs, while fungal levels increased.ConclusionOAs significantly reduce SSI in colorectal cancer surgery. However, excess OAs were significantly associated with the occurrence of PSC without contributing to further reduction in SSI.

Patients with progression of spinal metastases who present to the clinic have better outcomes compared to those who present to the emergency department	CANCER MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						acute care; neurologic complications; outcomes; spinal metastases; spine oncology clinic; stereotactic body radiation therapy	MANAGEMENT	Background: As cancer therapies have improved, spinal metastases are increasingly common. Resulting complications have a significant impact on patient's quality of life. Optimal methods of surveillance and avoidance of neurologic deficits are understudied. This study compares the clinical course of patients who initially presented to the emergency department (ED) versus a multidisciplinary spine oncology clinic and who underwent stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) secondary to progression/presentation of metastatic spine disease.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of adult oncologic patients who underwent spinal SBRT at a single hospital from 2010 to 2021. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed.Results: We identified 498 spinal radiographic treatment sites in 390 patients. Of these patients, 118 (30.3%) presented to the ED. Patients presenting to the ED compared to the clinic had significantly more severe spinal compression (52.5% vs. 11.7%; p < 0.0001), severe pain (28.8% vs. 10.3%; p < 0.0001), weakness (24.5% vs. 4.5%; p < 0.0001), and difficulty walking (24.5% vs. 4.5%; p < 0.0001). Patients who presented to the ED compared to the clinic were significantly more likely to have surgical intervention followed by SBRT (55.4% vs. 15.3%; p < 0.0001) compared to SBRT alone. Patients who presented to the ED compared to the clinic had a significantly quicker interval to distant spine progression (5.1 +/- 6.5 vs. 9.1 +/- 10.2 months; p = 0.004), systemic progression (5.1 +/- 7.2 vs. 9.2 +/- 10.7 months; p < 0.0001), and worse overall survival (9.3 +/- 10.0 vs. 14.3 +/- 13.7 months; p = 0.002).Conclusion: The establishment of multidisciplinary spine oncology clinics is an opportunity to potentially allow for earlier, more data-driven treatment of their spinal metastatic disease.

Similar Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of modified starches indicate minor structural changes; however, the degree of crystallinity significantly of native starch (26.88%) reduces after crosslinking (16.32%) and dual modification (13.91%). The native granules are flattened, elongated, oval-ellipsoidal, and compact granules, whereas STMP starches have smoother surfaces than STMP-DH starches. Due to changes in structure and functional groups, swelling and solubility of granules decrease, which depreciate the viscosity curve during cooking. In addition, pasting temperature elevates after STMP modification (76.3-83.1 & DEG;C) and remains comparable after STMP-DH (76.3-75.1 & DEG;C). The rheological analysis shows that native starch gel has more shear-thinning behavior and dominant elastic component than modified starches. The modified edible starch particles are successfully used to stabilize oil-in-water Pickering emulsion. The 2% and 3% STMP starches show better storage stability comparable to 3% OSA starch for up to 30 days. However, the loss in functional groups and amphiphilic properties of STMP-DH results in creaming and an inability to perform as desired. Modified banana starch particles are successfully used to stabilize oil-in-water Pickering emulsion. The 2% and 3% sodium trimetaphosphate crosslinked starches show better storage stability up to 30 days which is comparable to 3% octenyl succinic anhydride modified starch.image	[Sharma, Anamika; Bist, Yograj; Chakkingal, Fazil; Kumar, Yogesh; Saxena, Dharmesh Chandra] St Longowal Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Food Engn & Technol, Sangrur 148106, Punjab, India	Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering & Technology (SLIET)	Kumar, Y; Saxena, DC (corresponding author), St Longowal Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Food Engn & Technol, Sangrur 148106, Punjab, India.	kyogesh2u@gmail.com; dcsaxena@sliet.ac.in	Kumar, Yogesh/AAF-6163-2019	Kumar, Yogesh/0000-0002-8462-5889	The author, Mr. Yogesh Kumar, is greatly indebted to the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, for financial support through National Doctoral Fellowship (NDF, 2019).; All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi; National Doctoral Fellowship	The author, Mr. Yogesh Kumar, is greatly indebted to the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, for financial support through National Doctoral Fellowship (NDF, 2019).; All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi; National Doctoral Fellowship	The author, Mr. Yogesh Kumar, is greatly indebted to the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi, for financial support through National Doctoral Fellowship (NDF, 2019).		69	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	0038-9056	1521-379X		STARCH-STARKE	Starch-Starke	2023 SEP 30	2023										10.1002/star.202300084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.202300084		SEP 2023	13	Food Science & Technology	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Food Science & Technology	S7TY3					2023-10-18	WOS:001073169400001

Sex-independent timing of the onset of central puberty revealed by nocturnal luteinizing hormone concentrations	CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						central puberty; first morning voided; hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; luteinizing hormone; onset of puberty; sleeptime; urinary	PATTERN	ObjectiveWe designed a longitudinal study to investigate the association between the ages of central pubertal activation and the appearance of clinical signs of puberty and determined total luteinizing hormone (LH) immunoreactivity in daytime- and nocturnal sleeptime-excreted urine samples.Patients and MeasurementsThirty healthy volunteers (17 boys and 13 girls, aged 3.4-15.2 years and 4.3-14.3 years, respectively, at the beginning of the study) were included. Male and female subjects were followed for an average of 15 visits during 5.5 and 5.8 years on average, respectively. At each visit, subjects provided 24-h urine samples divided into nocturnal sleeptime and waketime portions according to the participant's sleep-and-wake rhythm. Total urinary LH (U-LH) concentrations were measured in duplicate by Delfia (R) IFMA (Wallac), which has been designed specifically to detect intact LH as well as the beta subunit and its core fragment, but not the human chorionic gonadotropin.ResultsThe initial increases in nocturnal sleeptime total U-LH concentrations over the cutoff value of 0.7 IU/L occurred at around the same time (around 9-10 years of age) in both sexes, which could not be detected in waketime urine samples. The mean first age for the nocturnal sleeptime total U-LH concentrations to reach or surpass the cutoff was 10.7 years (range: 10.2-11.6 years) in boys and 11.8 years (range: 10.7-13.4 years) in girls, showing no statistically significant difference between the sexes (p = .15). The mean time span from the age at which sleeptime total U-LH concentration first exceeded the 0.7 IU/L level to observing pubertal stage 2 was 1.5 years in boys and 0.1 years in girls.ConclusionsFindings in our population with a limited sample size suggest that the timing of central pubertal activation is a sex-independent phenomenon, which can be observed by monitoring the nocturnal sleeptime total LH concentrations in urine. The lag time from central pubertal activation of gonadotropin secretion to the clinical onset of puberty is significantly longer in boys.

Patients received tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo to week 16; all received open-label tofacitinib 5 mg BID to week 48 and were stratified by prior treatment (bDMARD-naive or tumor necrosis factor inhibitor [TNFi]-inadequate responder [IR], including bDMARD-experienced [non-IR]). Disease activity/safety were assessed throughout.Results Of 269 patients, 207 (77%) were bDMARD-naive; 62 (23%) were in the TNFi-IR subgroup. TNFi-IR patients had higher baseline BMI (28.0 vs. 26.1 kg/m(2)), longer symptom duration (14.4 vs. 13.2 years), and lower concomitant conventional synthetic DMARD use (14.5% vs. 30.9%) than bDMARD-naive patients. At week 16, for most outcomes, tofacitinib efficacy exceeded placebo for both subgroups and was sustained to week 48. At week 16, tofacitinib versus placebo differences were similar between bDMARD-naive and TNFi-IR patients (Assessment in Spondyloarthritis international Society 40 treatment difference [95% confidence interval]: 30.8% [19.1%-42.6%] vs. 19.4% [1.7%-37.0%]). Adverse event (AE) proportions were similar between tofacitinib-treated bDMARD-naive/TNFi-IR patients (77.5%/77.4%) at week 48 with no deaths. A numerically higher proportion of tofacitinib-treated TNFi-IR versus bDMARD-naive patients discontinued study drug (12.9% vs. 3.9%) or dose reduced/temporarily discontinued due to AEs (19.4% vs. 11.8%).Conclusion Tofacitinib efficacy exceeded placebo at week 16 for bDMARD-naive/TNFi-IR patients and was sustained to week 48. The absolute magnitude of responses was generally greater in bDMARD-naive patients versus TNFi-IR patients. More TNFi-IR versus bDMARD-naive patients discontinued or dose reduced/temporarily discontinued tofacitinib due to AEs. Small sample size and sample size differences between subgroups limited the interpretation.

T-DNA insertion into a gene's exons, introns or untranscribed regions close to the start or stop codon can disrupt gene function. Such T-DNA mutants have been useful for reverse genetics analysis, especially in Arabidopsis thaliana. As T-DNAs are inserted into genomic DNA, they are generally believed to be stably inherited. Here, we report a phenomenon of reversion of intronic T-DNA mutant phenotypes. From a suppressor screen using intronic T-DNA pi4k beta 1,2 double mutant, we recovered intragenic mutants of pi4k beta 1, which suppressed the autoimmunity of the double mutant. These mutants carried deletions in the intronic T-DNAs, resulting in elevated transcription of normal PI4K beta 1. Such reversion of T-DNA insertional mutant phenotype stresses the need for caution when using intronic T-DNA mutants and reiterates the importance of using irreversible null mutant alleles in genetic analyses.

In behavior analytic interventions for autistic children, practitioners commonly use pairing to establish rapport. A limited body of research has evaluated how to train interventionists to pair with their child clients. Furthermore, fewer studies have examined the effects of pairing on client behavior. Therefore, we implemented behavioral skills training to teach interventionists pairing skills and assessed the effects of presession pairing on child interfering behavior using a concurrent multiple probe design (with replication). We implemented a pairing protocol before early intensive behavioral intervention sessions with four children (3-5 years old) on the autism spectrum. Interventionists mastered pairing skills during training sessions, which were generally maintained when working with child clients. When interventionists implemented presession pairing, child participants demonstrated fewer interfering behaviors. We discuss implications of our preliminary findings and future directions.

Here, the ultrathin tetraphenylethylene-active tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) derivative nanosheets (abbreviated as Ru-TPE NSs) are synthesized through a protein-assisted self-assembly strategy for ultrasensitive ECL detection of human telomerase RNA (hTR) for the first time. The synthesized Ru-TPE NSs exhibit the aggregation-induced enhanced ECL behavior and excellent water-dispersion. Surprisingly, up to a 106.5-fold increase in the ECL efficiency of Ru-TPE NSs is demonstrated compared with the dispersed molecules in an organic solution. The restriction of intramolecular motions is confirmed to be responsible for the significant ECL enhancement. Therefore, this proposed ECL biosensor shows high sensitivity and excellent selectivity for hTR based on Ru-TPE NSs as efficient ECL beacons and the catalytic hairpin assembly as signal amplification, whose detection limit is as low as 8.0 fm, which is far superior to the previously reported works. Here, a promising analytical method is provided for early clinical diagnosis and a new type of efficient ECL emitters with great application prospects is represented. The ultrathin tetraphenylethylene-active tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) derivative nanosheets are synthesized through a protein-assisted self-assembly strategy and realize aggregation-induced enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) and excellent water-dispersion. Accordingly, the ultrathin nanosheets serve as efficient ECL beacons for ultrasensitive determination of human telomerase RNA.image	[Han, Tingting] Jiangsu Acad Agr Sci, Jiangsu Key Lab Food Qual & Safety, State Key Lab Cultivat Base, Minist Sci & Technol,Inst Food Safety & Nutr, Nanjing 210014, Peoples R China; [Han, Tingting; Geng, Yu-Qian; Cao, Yue; Zhu, Jun-Jie] Nanjing Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Analyt Chem Life Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Min; Zhu, Jun-Jie] Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Civil Engn, Guangdong Engn & Technol Res Ctr Adv Nanomat, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China	Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Nanjing University; Dongguan University of Technology	Cao, Y; Zhu, JJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, State Key Lab Analyt Chem Life Sci, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.; Zhang, M; Zhu, JJ (corresponding author), Dongguan Univ Technol, Sch Environm & Civil Engn, Guangdong Engn & Technol Res Ctr Adv Nanomat, Dongguan 523808, Peoples R China.	mindear@dgut.edu.cn; iamycao@njupt.edu.cn; jjzhu@nju.edu.cn		Han, Tingting/0009-0008-7015-7640	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21834004 and 22174061) and the Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science (SKLACLS2311).

J	Ikink, I; Roelofs, K; Figner, B				Ikink, Iris; Roelofs, Karin; Figner, Bernd			The effect of time ambiguity on choice depends on delay and amount magnitude	JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article; Early Access						ambiguity; decision-making; delay discounting; intertemporal choice; uncertainty	INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE; DECISION-MAKING; RISK; REAL; EQUIVALENCE; UNCERTAINTY; CORTEX	Time ambiguity-that is, having partially/fully incomplete information about when an outcome will occur-is common in everyday life. A recent study showed that participants preferred options with time-exact delays over options with time-ambiguous delays, a phenomenon they called time-ambiguity aversion. However, the empirical robustness and boundaries of this phenomenon remain unexplored. We conducted three online studies: Study 2 (n = 118) was a replication of Study 1 (n = 76) using preregistered analyses; Study 3 (n = 202; preregistered) was a follow-up study suggested during review. In Studies 1 and 2, participants completed hypothetical choices between euro5 today versus later-but-larger (LL) rewards that systematically varied in their amount, delay, and time-ambiguity level (e.g., for a 180 day delay, time ambiguity varied from 179 to 181 to 0-360 days). Effects of time ambiguity on choice were best encoded in an absolute, dose-dependent manner and depended on delays and amounts: Increasing time ambiguity led to more time-exact LL choices at shorter delays but more time-ambiguous LL choices at longer delays. Additionally, time-ambiguity ranges including today were chosen more frequently than ranges excluding today, akin to the present bias in intertemporal choice. Lastly, evidence suggested that more time ambiguity was preferred for smaller LL amounts yet disliked for larger LL amounts. Study 3 demonstrated that time-risk and time-ambiguity preferences are differentiable by giving participants choices involving hypothetical time-exact, time-ambiguous, and time-risky options. Taken together, our results extend the nascent literature on time ambiguity by showing that (i) time-ambiguity preferences are distinguishable from both time-risk and delay preferences and (ii) time ambiguity is not generally aversive, but its impact depends on delay and amount magnitude.

However, their ability to differentiate after ischemic injury is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the properties and functions of NG2 glia in the ischemic brain. Using transgenic mice, we selectively labeled NG2-expressing cells and their progeny in both healthy brain and after focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we classified the labeled glial cells into five distinct subpopulations based on their gene expression patterns. Additionally, we examined the membrane properties of these cells using the patch-clamp technique. Of the identified subpopulations, three were identified as OPCs, whereas the fourth subpopulation had characteristics indicative of cells likely to develop into oligodendrocytes. The fifth subpopulation of NG2 glia showed astrocytic markers and had similarities to neural progenitor cells. Interestingly, this subpopulation was present in both healthy and post-ischemic tissue; however, its gene expression profile changed after ischemia, with increased numbers of genes related to neurogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the temporal expression of neurogenic genes and showed an increased presence of NG2 cells positive for Purkinje cell protein-4 at the periphery of the ischemic lesion 12 days after FCI, as well as NeuN-positive NG2 cells 28 and 60 days after injury. These results suggest the potential development of neuron-like cells arising from NG2 glia in the ischemic tissue. Our study provides insights into the plasticity of NG2 glia and their capacity for neurogenesis after stroke.

Leaf-roll gall formation in Reynoutria x bohemica and its implications for biological control with Aphalara itadori	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article; Early Access						Aphalara itadori; biocontrol agent; establishment; Fallopia; galls; Hemiptera; invasive; knotweed; leaf-roll galling; Polygonaceae; Psyllidae; Reynoutria; weeds	FALLOPIA-JAPONICA; INVASIVE KNOTWEEDS; JAPANESE KNOTWEED; CONTROL AGENT; PLANT; HEMIPTERA; PSYLLOIDEA; HOMOPTERA; CECIDOGENESIS; THYSANOPTERA	The psyllid Aphalara itadori Shinji (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) is a biocontrol agent against invasive knotweed species (Polygonaceae) in Europe and North America. Despite an extensive release program, successful establishment of the agent has never been confirmed. The slow establishment of A. itadori in its introduced range appears to be predominantly the result of nymphal mortality, either through desiccation, predation, or the adaptation of captive populations to low-stress environments. In 2016, CABI UK collected a new line of psyllids from Murakami, Niigata Prefecture, in Japan, where it was observed causing severe leaf-roll galling on one of the many varieties of native knotweeds. The induction of leaf-roll galls by Murakami psyllids on invasive Bohemian knotweed, Reynoutria x bohemica, has the potential to alleviate some or all of the observed nymphal mortality factors. We conducted a series of growth chamber experiments to explore the psyllid behaviors that initiate leaf-roll galls, and the ways in which the galls might benefit the psyllids and inhibit invasive knotweed. Reynoutria x bohemica exposed to A. itadori for 4 weeks suffered reduced stem elongation and leaf area compared to control plants. Artificial leaf-roll galls were consistently utilized by developing A. itadori nymphs, and contributed to their survival. Leaf-roll galling in R. x bohemica was predominantly initiated by early instar nymphs of A. itadori, and only occurred when leaves were attacked at a very early stage in their development. Our results can inform the knotweed biocontrol program in several key ways. Releases of A. itadori should be timed so that developing nymphs have access to newly emerging leaves. Monitoring efforts at release sites should focus on the growing tips of R. x bohemica, where the highly mobile nymphs appear to migrate. Finally, our results provide motivation to seek additional lines of A. itadori that may affect other invasive knotweed species in similar ways.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the combined effects of hot-boned meat, freezing and myofibrillar protein supplementation on the physicochemical properties of phosphate-free emulsion-type sausage. Freezing hot-boned meat and adding myofibrillar protein enhanced pH, protein solubility and thermal stability, which reduced cooking losses (9.50%-15.48%) and enhanced emulsion stability, resulting in a positive effect on the rheological and texture profiles of the phosphate-free emulsion-type sausage. In particular, the sausage prepared with frozen hot-boned meat and myofibrillar protein addition exhibited the highest hardness value (39.60 N), and its physical properties were almost identical to the positive control. Accordingly, hot-boned meat, freezing and myofibrillar protein incorporation could enhance the quality of phosphate-free meat products. This study highlights promising avenues for improving meat products to meet consumer preferences.

Poloxamers are tri-block copolymers that are used as surfactants but have applications in drug and antibiotic delivery. However, their biological effects on bone regeneration systems remain unelucidated. Here, we aimed to understand how supplementing the prototype CPC with poloxamer would impact cellular activity and its function as a bone-grafting material. A novel CPC, modified beta-tricalcium phosphate (m beta-TCP) powder, was developed through a planetary ball-milling process using a beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP). The m beta-TCP dissolves rapidly and accelerates hydroxyapatite precipitation; successfully shortening the cement setting time and enhancing the strength. Furthermore, the addition of poloxamer 407 to m beta-TCP could reduce the risk of leakage from bone defects and improve fracture toughness while maintaining mechanical properties. In this study, the poloxamer addition effects (0.05 and 0.1 g/mL) on the cellular activities of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in vitro were investigated. The cell viability of m beta-TCP containing poloxamer 407 was similar to that of m beta-TCP. All specimens showed effective cell attachment and healthy polygonal extension of the cytoplasm firmly attached to hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals. Therefore, even with the addition of poloxamer to m beta-TCP, it does not have a negative effect to osteoblast growth. These data demonstrated that the addition of poloxamer 407 to m beta-TCP might be considered a potential therapeutic application for the repair and regeneration of bone defects.

Tissue formation and host remodeling of an elastomeric biodegradable scaffold in an ovine pulmonary leaflet replacement model	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A			English	Article; Early Access						biodegradable scaffold; heart valve; inflammation; PECUU; tissue engineering	ENGINEERED HEART-VALVES; MACROPHAGE PHENOTYPE; IMPLANTATION; STRETCH; ADULT; CELLS	In pursuit of a suitable scaffold material for cardiac valve tissue engineering applications, an acellular, electrospun, biodegradable polyester carbonate urethane urea (PECUU) scaffold was evaluated as a pulmonary valve leaflet replacement in vivo. In sheep (n = 8), a single pulmonary valve leaflet was replaced with a PECUU leaflet and followed for 1, 6, and 12 weeks. Implanted leaflet function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography. Explanted samples were studied for gross pathology, microscopic changes in the extracellular matrix, host cellular re-population, and immune responses, and for biomechanical properties. PECUU leaflets showed normal leaflet motion at implant, but decreased leaflet motion and dimensions at 6 weeks. The leaflets accumulated & alpha;-SMA and CD45 positive cells, with surfaces covered with endothelial cells (CD31+). New collagen formation occurred (Picrosirius Red). Accumulated tissue thickness correlated with the decrease in leaflet motion. The PECUU scaffolds had histologic evidence of scaffold degradation and an accumulation of pro-inflammatory/M1 and anti-inflammatory/M2 macrophages over time in vivo. The extent of inflammatory cell accumulation correlated with tissue formation and polymer degradation but was also associated with leaflet thickening and decreased leaflet motion. Future studies should explore pre-implant seeding of polymer scaffolds, more advanced polymer fabrication methods able to more closely approximate native tissue structure and function, and other techniques to control and balance the degradation of biomaterials and new tissue formation by modulation of the host immune response.

This byproduct results from the incorporation of new blends of vegetable oils, such as soybean and palm oil, making it of interest due to its distinct chemical composition and matrix, which differ from those of deodorizer distillates studied previously. The significance of the present investigation is related to the properties of the oil blend, requiring the establishment of new process conditions for this specific VODD. Experimental design was used to evaluate the WFMD process variables, with the aim of removing free fatty acids and enabling eight PN to be concentrated in the reprocessing stages.ResultsThe product obtained after three WFMD stages presented a fivefold increase in the total PN concentration, compared to the raw material. Notably, the procedure provided enrichment ratios of 7.2-fold for total tocopherols (including & alpha;-, & beta;-, & lambda;- and & delta;-tocopherols), 4.5-fold for total phytosterols (including campesterol, stigmasterol and & beta;-sitosterol) and 1.2-fold for squalene, together with a deacidification efficiency of 78.93%.ConclusionThe proposed process provided significant concentration gains for all eight PN evaluated, resulting in a value-added product. These excellent results were achieved using only three WFMD stages, without any need for additional processing steps. The data obtained at the pilot scale provide valuable insights for predicting the scalability of the process and facilitating potential industrial implementation. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Other than the capacity to recruit natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, CXCL14 suppresses CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions by inducing CXCR4 internalization. Thus, CXCL14 can both promote and hinder immune responses. Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammatory disorder in which various chemokines play an important role.Methods To investigate possible roles of CXCL14 in psoriasis, we examined CXCL14 expression in lesional skin by immunohistochemistry and measured serum CXCL14 levels in psoriasis. We also assessed the effect of ultraviolet irradiation, one of the main therapies for psoriasis, on CXCL14 expression by HaCaT cells.Results CXCL14 expression was decreased in epidermal keratinocytes in lesional skin and serum CXCL14 levels were negatively correlated with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores in psoriasis patients. Serum CXCL14 levels were increased in nbUVB-treated psoriasis patients and UVB irradiation induced CXCL14 mRNA expression from HaCaT cells.Conclusion Our results suggest that decreased CXCL14 expression may contribute to the exacerbation of psoriasis and that the amplification of CXCL14 can be a therapeutic option for psoriasis. One of the mechanisms of the efficacy of nbUVB therapy in psoriasis may be the upregulation of CXCL14.

As a carbon-rich molecule, PET could be a carbon source for microorganisms dwelling in glacier habitats. Thus, glacial microorganisms may be potential PET degraders with novel PET hydrolases. Here, we obtained 414 putative PET hydrolase sequences by searching a global glacier metagenome dataset. Metagenomes from the Alps and Tibetan glaciers exhibited a higher relative abundance of putative PET hydrolases than those from the Arctic and Antarctic. Twelve putative PET hydrolase sequences were cloned and expressed, with one sequence (designated as GlacPETase) proven to degrade amorphous PET film with a similar performance as IsPETase, but with a higher thermostability. GlacPETase exhibited only 30% sequence identity to known active PET hydrolases with a novel disulphide bridge location and, therefore may represent a novel PET hydrolases class. The present work suggests that extreme carbon-poor environments may harbour a diverse range of known and novel PET hydrolases for carbon acquisition as an environmental adaptation mechanism. Qi et al. identified 414 genes of potential Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolases from metagenomes of global glaciers. By cloning and expression in E. coli, one enzyme demonstrated evident activity against PET. This enzyme, designated as GlacPETase is mesophilic and harbours a single disulphide bridge at the N-terminus. This work revealed the potential of obtaining novel PET degradation enzymes from glacier environment.image	[Qi, Xiaoyan; Yin, Chao-Fan; Zhou, Ning-Yi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Joint Int Res Lab Metab & Dev Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qi, Xiaoyan; Yin, Chao-Fan; Zhou, Ning-Yi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Ji, Mukan; Liu, Yongqin] Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Pan Pole Environm 3, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yongqin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yongqin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ning-Yi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Joint Int Res Lab Metab & Dev Sci, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ning-Yi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yongqin] Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Pan Pole Environm 3, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China	Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Lanzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Lanzhou University	Liu, YQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Liu, YQ (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhou, NY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Microbial Metab, Joint Int Res Lab Metab & Dev Sci, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Zhou, NY (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Life Sci & Biotechnol, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Liu, YQ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Pan Pole Environm 3, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.	ningyi.zhou@sjtu.edu.cn; yql@lzu.edu.cn			This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) (2019QZKK0503), the Seed Industry Revitalisation Project of Guangdong Province (23050202), the National Key Research and Development Plans (2021YFC2300 [2019QZKK0503]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) [23050202]; Seed Industry Revitalisation Project of Guangdong Province [2021YFC2300904]; National Key Research and Development Plans [42171138, 918512]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91851207]; Major Research plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China	This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) (2019QZKK0503), the Seed Industry Revitalisation Project of Guangdong Province (23050202), the National Key Research and Development Plans (2021YFC2300; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP); Seed Industry Revitalisation Project of Guangdong Province; National Key Research and Development Plans; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Research plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This study was supported by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP) (2019QZKK0503), the Seed Industry Revitalisation Project of Guangdong Province (23050202), the National Key Research and Development Plans (2021YFC2300904), National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program 42171138 and 918512), and the Major Research plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91851207).		58	0	0	2	2	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1462-2912	1462-2920		ENVIRON MICROBIOL	Environ.

Buds of new bone formation within the Femoral Head of Hip Fracture Patients Coincide with Zones of Low Osteocyte Sclerostin	JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						MODELING-BASED BONE FORMATION; FORMING MINIMODELING STRUCTURES; FEMORAL HEAD; BONE HISTOMORPHOMETRY; FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; CORTICAL BONE; WNT; TERIPARATIDE; ROMOSOZUMAB; STRENGTH; OSTEONS; FEMUR; WOMEN; MASS	Romosozumab treatment reduces the rate of hip fractures and increases hip bone density, increasing bone formation by inhibiting sclerostin protein. We studied the normal pattern of bone formation and osteocyte expression in the human proximal femur because it is relevant to both antisclerostin treatment effects and fracture. Having visualized and quantified buds of new bone formation in trabeculae, we hypothesized that they would coincide with areas of (a) higher mechanical stress and (b) low sclerostin expression by osteocytes. In patients with hip fracture, we visualized each bud of active modeling-based formation (forming minimodeling structure [FMiS]) in trabecular cores taken from different parts of the femoral head. Trabecular bone structure was also measured with high-resolution imaging. More buds of new bone formation (by volume) were present in the higher stress superomedial zone (FMiS density, N.FMiS/T.Ar) than lower stress superolateral (p < 0.05), and inferomedial (p < 0.001) regions. There were fewer sclerostin expressing osteocytes close to or within FMiS. FMiS density correlated with greater amount, thickness, number, and connectivity of trabeculae (bone volume BV/TV, r = 0.65, p < 0.0001; bone surface BS/TV, r = 0.47, p < 0.01; trabecular thickness Tb.Th, r = 0.55, p < 0.001; trabecular number Tb.N, r = 0.47, p < 0.01; and connectivity density Conn.D, r = 0.40, p < 0.05) and lower trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, r = -0.56, p < 0.001). These results demonstrate modeling-based bone formation in femoral trabeculae from patients with hip fracture as a potential therapeutic target to enhance bone structure.

Recently, an increasing number of laboratory-scale enzymatic electrosyntheses have shown impressive performance indicators, leading to scientific interest in technical implementation. However, important process parameters are missing in most of the relevant literature. On one hand, this is due to the large variety of relevant performance indicators. On the other hand, enzyme technologists and electrochemists use different parameters to describe a process. In this article, we review the most important performance indicators in electroenzymatic processes and suggest that in order to allow quantitative comparison, these indicators should be reported in all respective publications. In addition to quantitative parameters, non-quantitative assessments often need to be included in a final evaluation. Examples of such parameters are sustainability, contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals or interactions with the overall process. We demonstrate the evaluation of processes using hydrogen peroxide-dependent peroxygenases. The strength of the proposed evaluation system lies in its ability to identify weaknesses in a process at an early stage of development. Finally, it can be concluded that all evaluated enzymatic electrosynthesis do not yet meet typical industrial requirements for an enzyme-based process. Compare, contrast, scrutinize and decide: Various process options can be used to bring enzyme processes to industrial application; these include electroenzymatic processes. To evaluate the processes quantitatively, appropriate performance indicators must be determined. In addition, there are non-quantitative variables that need to be considered. This article shows how laboratory processes can be evaluated and how options for action can be identified.image	[Sayoga, Giovanni; Bueschler, Victoria; Liese, Andreas] Hamburg Univ Technol, Inst Tech Biocatalysis, Denickestr 15, D-21073 Hamburg, Germany; [Abt, Michael; Franzreb, Matthias] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Funct Interfaces, Hermann Von Helmholtz Pl 1, D-76344 Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [Teetz, Niklas; Holtmann, Dirk] Univ Appl Sci Mittelhessen, Inst Bioproc Engn & Pharmaceut Technol, Wiesenstr 14, D-35390 Giessen, Germany; [Teetz, Niklas; Holtmann, Dirk] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Proc Engn Life Sci, Fritz Haber Weg 4, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany	Hamburg University of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology	Holtmann, D (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Proc Engn Life Sci, Fritz Haber Weg 4, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.	dirk.holtmann@kit.edu			This work was performed within the project "Bioelectrochemical and engineering fundamentals to establish electro-biotechnology for biosynthesis - Power to value-added products (eBiotech)" funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - project number [422694804]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [465474720]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft	This work was performed within the project "Bioelectrochemical and engineering fundamentals to establish electro-biotechnology for biosynthesis - Power to value-added products (eBiotech)" funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - project number; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))	This work was performed within the project "Bioelectrochemical and engineering fundamentals to establish electro-biotechnology for biosynthesis - Power to value-added products (eBiotech)" funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - project number 422694804.

In this study, a binder-free self-supported CCO@N0.5C0.5OH/NF cathode material is constructed with hierarchical hetero-core-shell honeycomb nanostructure by first growing CuCo2O4 (CCO) nanopin arrays uniformly on highly conductive nickel foam (NF) substrate, and then anchoring Ni0.5Co0.5(OH)(2) (N0.5C0.5OH) bimetallic hydroxide nanosheet arrays on the CCO nanopin arrays by adjusting the molar ratio of Ni(OH)(2) and Co(OH)(2). The constructed CCO@N0.5C0.5OH/NF electrode material showcases a wealth of multivalent metal ions and mesopores, along with good electrical conductivity, excellent electrochemical reaction rates, and robust long-term performance (capacitance retention rate of 87.2%). The CCO@N0.5C0.5OH/NF electrode, benefiting from the hierarchical structure of the material and the exceptional synergy between multiple components, demonstrates an excellent specific capacitance (2553.6 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)). Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric CCO@N0.5C0.5OH/NF//AC/NF supercapacitor demonstrates a high energy density (70.1 Wh kg(-1) at 850 W kg(-1)), and maintains robust capacitance cycling stability performance (83.7%) after undergoing 10 000 successive charges and discharges. It is noteworthy that the assembled supercapacitor exhibits an operating voltage (1.7 V) that is well above the theoretical value (1.5 V).

Survey teams often must be creative to cover the largest area possible, in a short time, with limited budgets, without losing quality and effectiveness in their work. The use of techniques employing geographic information system (GIS) tools has tremendously improved the efficiency and quality of the surveys. Such techniques were employed in the Jabal al-Yamh and Hatta Valley (Emirate of Dubai, UAE), and their methodology, implementation and effectiveness are discussed in this paper. The Jabal al-Yamh Research Project, which began in 2018 to survey, excavate, restore and research the prehistoric tombs in the Jabal al-Yamh and the surrounding Hatta Valley, thus used primarily GIS tools employing remote sensing and probabilistic analysis to identify a large number of tombs in this rugged topography, delimitating areas more likely to contain tombs. On the other hand, identifying tomb distribution and orientation patterns through GIS data queries also allowed us to answer several sociocultural questions posed during the development of this project. This paper will thus discuss two primary purposes of this project's survey: methods for identifying new tombs for further excavation and protection, on the one hand, and the interpretation of those same tombs' emplacement, attending to their distribution and orientation pattern, on the other, thus developing a theoretical and predictive model of the distribution of prehistoric tombs in the area.

Here, the growth process of the PANI films synthesized by the pre-nucleation electrodeposition method is analyzed and the optimal parameters with highest electrochemical activity are obtained. The PANI film fabricated under high current density of 10 mA cm-2 and impact time of 0.2 s shows the best electrochemical performance. It has a maximum active charge of 22.3 mC cm-2. The optimum electrochemical performance is attributed to the loose and porous structure. The PANI films fabricated under the optimal parameters also show the flattest structure and the smooth surface. It concludes a universal evaluation basis of the optimal conditions for the pre-nucleation method. That is, in the nucleation stage, the potential curve shall peak rapidly and then fall slowly to the valley without any upward growth; when entering into the low current density growth stage, the potential shall fall rapidly to a certain value and grow at that potential smoothly. This work evokes a deeper understanding and controlling of the growth process of polymers.

In present paper a green approach for the preparation of pure nickel oxide (NiO) and 5% cobalt-doped NiO (Co+NiO) nanoparticles (NPs) by using Prosopis fracta extract have been study. The product of Co+NiO NPs was proved through the PXRD, Raman, UV-Vis, FESEM, and EDX analyses. The results of XRD, EDX, and UV-Visible spectra displayed well doped cobalt in NiO NP. The particle sizes of Co+NiO NPs were observed to be about 80 nm. The MTT test results for the cytotoxicity of Co+NiO NPs on breast cancer cells (MCF-7) affirmed the stronger impact of doped NiO-NPs on cancer cells compared to NiO NPs. Thus, it is indicated that the doping process on NiO NPs caused an increase in its inhibitory effect against MCF-7 cells.

Current front-line therapeutics for T2D patients include sulfonylureas that act to reduce A1C and fasting blood glucose levels, or Metformin that antagonizes the action of glucagon to reduce hepatic glucose production. Next-generation glucomodulatory therapeutics target members of the high-affinity glucose transporter sodium-glucose-linked-transporter (SGLT) family. SGLT1 is primarily expressed in intestinal epithelium, whose inhibition reduces dietary glucose uptake, whilst SGLT2 is highly expressed in kidney regulating glucose reabsorption. A number of SGLT2 inhibitors are FDA approved whilst SGLT1 and dual SGLT1 & 2 inhibitor are currently in clinical trials. Here, SGLT2, SGLT1, and dual inhibitors' biochemical mechanism and physiological effects are discussed and compared. Here, the biochemical mechanism and physiological effects of the SGLT2 and SGLT1 selective and dual SGLT1/2 inhibitors effects are studied and compared to understand their therapeutic potential in treating type-2 Diabetes Mellitus and describe the evolution of advanced therapeutics against SGLTs.image	[Azizogli, Abdul-Rahman; Kumar, Vivek A.] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Vitti, Michael R.] Univ Virginia, Sch Med, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Mishra, Richa; Osorno, Laura; Heffernan, Corey; Kumar, Vivek A.] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Kumar, Vivek A.] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Kumar, Vivek A.] Rutgers Sch Dent Med, Dept Endodont, Newark, NJ 07103 USA	New Jersey Institute of Technology; University of Virginia; New Jersey Institute of Technology; New Jersey Institute of Technology; Rutgers State University New Brunswick; Rutgers State University Medical Center	Kumar, VA (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.; Kumar, VA (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.; Kumar, VA (corresponding author), New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.; Kumar, VA (corresponding author), Rutgers Sch Dent Med, Dept Endodont, Newark, NJ 07103 USA.	vak@njit.edu			V.A.K. acknowledges support from the NIH NEI R15 EY029504, NIH NIDCR R01DE031812, NIH NIAMS R21AR079708, NIH NIAMS R01AR080895, NIH NIDCR R01DE029321, and NIH NCATS UL1TR003017, and the Undergraduate Research and Innovation program at NJIT.

In principle, its application is fairly straightforward, but can be tedious and involve a trial-and-error approach to identify and judge the best set of parameters. With the availability of quantum chemical methods to predict d-d transitions in transition metal complexes, a rich source of computational spectroscopic data with unambiguous assignments to electronic states is available. Herein, we present AOMadillo, a software package that is designed to interface the output of ab initio LFT calculations from the ORCA suite of programs and performs a least-squares fit for a chosen AOM parameterization. Many steps of the AOM parameterization are automated, so that scans of geometric parameters and evaluations of sets of similar complexes are convenient. The fitting routine is highly configurable, allowing the efficient evaluation of different parameter sets.

However, its structural stability and reaction mechanism still have not been fully explored. As the electron beam irradiation introduces a similar impact on the Na2Ti3O7 anode as the extraction of Na+ ions during the battery discharge process, the microstructure evolution of the materials is investigated by advanced electron microscopy techniques at the atomic scale. Anisotropic amorphization is successfully observed. Through the integrated differential phase contrast-scanning transmission electron microscopy technique and density functional theory calculation, a phase transition pathway involving a new phase, Na2Ti24O49, is proposed with the reduction of Na atoms. Additionally, it is found that the amorphization is dominated by the surface energy and electron dose rate. These findings will deepen the understanding of structural stability and deintercalation mechanism of the Na2Ti3O7 anode, providing new insight into exploring the failure mechanism of electrode materials.

The Founder certification effect, firm disclosures, and the cost of SEO financing	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS FINANCE & ACCOUNTING			English	Article; Early Access						financing cost; founder; management guidance; seasoned equity offerings; voluntary disclosure	SEASONED EQUITY OFFERINGS; CORPORATE GOVERNANCE; OPERATING PERFORMANCE; INVESTMENT DECISIONS; UNDERWRITING FEES; FAMILY OWNERSHIP; MARKET; MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; CHOICE	We investigate the effect of founder control on firms' financing costs for seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Firms issuing SEOs are subject to increased information asymmetry and associated agency conflicts. We hypothesize that founder control has a certification effect that mitigates such problems, and consequently, reduces the cost of issuing SEOs. Consistent with our prediction, firms with founder control enjoy higher abnormal announcement returns and lower SEO gross spreads. We also show that founder firms have better post-SEO operating performance than non-founder firms. Additionally, we document that the founder certification effect is more salient among firms with poorer pre-SEO operating performance and those that do not disclose specific use of the SEO proceeds. Finally, we show that founder firms do not increase the frequency of management earnings forecasts as much as non-founder firms prior to the SEO. Our results are robust to a battery of sensitivity analyses, and our conclusions are consistent with the founder certification effect.

The exploration was based on the experiences of Registered Nurses at a selected teaching hospital in Namibia. The researcher intended to identify strategies that could be used to mitigate the negative effects of barriers to effective clinical teaching.DesignA qualitative explorative, descriptive and contextual research design was used.MethodsPurposive sampling was used to select 16 participants. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.ResultsClinical teaching is negatively affected by several barriers that hamper clinical teaching and nursing students' learning outcomes. Seven main themes were identified: (1) participants' understanding of clinical teaching; (2) organizational barriers; (3) patient barriers; (4) Registered Nurse barriers; (5) student barriers; (6) training institution barriers; and (7) strategies to mitigate barriers to clinical teaching.ConclusionThe findings revealed that several barriers negatively affect clinical nursing education and hamper the clinical teaching and learning of nursing students.Patient or Public ContributionThis study may assist in the development of targeted interventions that address the barriers that hinder clinical teaching at teaching hospitals. Additionally, this study could assist in improving the health care that is provided by nursing students to patients. The findings may assist with improved quality by reducing nursing students' theory-practice gap and by promoting collaboration between Registered Nurses and nurse educators in clinical settings.

Considerable research has addressed the persistence of highly diverse biological communities within MTEs, despite their typically long histories of anthropogenic and natural disturbance. However, important questions remain, especially regarding the limits of ecological resilience in the face of accelerating environmental change. Here, we explore current knowledge regarding the effects of disturbance on MTE plant-pollinator communities.LocationMediterranean Basin, California, Cape Province in South Africa, Central Chile and Southern South-Western Australia.Taxa StudiedFlowering plants and pollinators (insects, birds and mammals).MethodsWe reviewed the available literature about MTE plant-pollinator communities via a systematic search that yielded 234 case studies. We analysed this dataset to quantify research efforts across regions and taxonomic groups, the proportion of surveys addressing ecological interactions (i.e. rather than only taxonomic diversity) and the availability of work addressing community responses to specific stressors (viz. climate change, landscape alteration, fire, farming, grazing, urbanization and species introductions).ResultsCurrent knowledge on MTE plant-pollinator communities is dominated by work from the northern Mediterranean Basin, while the Southern Hemisphere and California are markedly understudied by comparison. Taxonomic coverage is similarly uneven, with 58% of studies focusing only on a single pollinator group. Furthermore, less than half of the surveys address ecological networks. Finally, despite some pioneering work addressing fire, climate and species introductions, only 13% focus on the impact of stressors on interaction networks.OutlookBased on our findings, we identify a need for coordinated international research efforts focusing on (i) community-level studies, observational and experimental, (ii) ecological networks, (iii) functional traits mediating post-disturbance recovery and (iv) impacts of combined/synergistic stressors. Progress in these areas will facilitate predictions about the long-term impacts of global change on MTE plant-pollinator communities.

Osteogenic and fibroblastic osteosarcoma associated with the alveolar bulla and zygomatic arch in a pet rabbit	VETERINARY RECORD CASE REPORTS			English	Article; Early Access						alveolar bulla; neoplasia; osteosarcoma; rabbit		A 2.5-year-old, 2.9 kg, neutered, male domestic rabbit presented for sudden onset of sneezing and wheezing of 2-day duration. Upon physical examination, there was mild dyspnoea characterised by mild to moderate increased inspiratory effort and audible wheeze, without evidence of ocular or nasal discharge. An aggressive expansile lytic mass lesion of the right caudal maxilla extending into the zygomatic arch was identified on skull radiographs. Computed tomography confirmed a large heterogeneously contrast enhancing soft tissue mass associated with the lytic lesion, likely originating from the right alveolar bulla, extending into the zygomatic arch. Histopathological diagnosis was osteosarcoma with areas of osteogenic and fibroblastic patterns. Diseases of the nasal cavity are common in rabbits; while infectious rhinitis remains the most common diagnosis, increasing number of cases of neoplasms involving the maxilla and nasal cavity should remind clinicians to include it in the differential diagnosis list.

We introduce a set of Bayesian dynamic models designed to accurately represent wildfire losses, allowing a thorough examination of wildfire CAT bond pricing and hedge effectiveness. Our model captures crucial attributes of wildfire data, such as zero inflation, overdispersion, temporal fluctuations, and spatial dependence. Employing extensive quantitative analyses of US wildfire data, we highlight that CAT bonds can substantially mitigate tail risk associated with insurers' liability. Importantly, index-based CAT bonds, drawing their payouts from aggregate wildfire losses over a larger geographical scope than an insurer's operational area, also provide effective hedges. Our research underscores the potential of wildfire CAT bonds as an enhancement to traditional reinsurance strategies, offering insurers an improved means to manage and mitigate wildfire exposures amidst inherent uncertainties.

All as-cast HEAs consist of face-centered-cubic (FCC)- and body-centered-cubic (BCC)-structured phases, wherein the BCC-structured phase is composed of disordered BCC (A2) and ordered BCC (B2) phases. The HEAs show FCC dendrite and BCC inter-dendrite microstructure when x <= 4. As the Ti content increases to 6 and 8 at%, the microstructure evolves from dendrite structures to complex lamellar structures, leading to a significant loss in ductility. With the increase of Ti, the strength is enhanced with the sacrifice of ductility. The (Fe40Ni30Cr20Al10)(96)Ti-4 alloy exhibits promising combinations of strength and ductility, displaying a yield strength of 680 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 1132 MPa, and a total elongation of 16.6%. The simple FCC + BCC dendrite microstructure and optimal content of the BCC-structured region containing A2 + B2 phases are responsible for the excellent tensile properties of the as-cast (Fe40Ni30Cr20Al10)(96)Ti(4 )HEA. In this work, it is suggested that good combinations of strength and ductility of low-cost Co-free FeNiCrAl-based HEAs can be achieved by tailoring Ti addition.

An emerging issue in this discussion is the role of natural resources in determining the nature of the agricultural ODA (Official Development Assistance) and democracy nexus. Consequently, this study examines the effect of democracy on the agricultural ODA in Africa and how the country's natural resource rents mitigate this relationship using panel data of 50 countries over the 1995-2019 period. A set of econometric tools is used to estimate the time-series cross-sectional models, which include country fixed-effects model and system generalized method of moments (system GMM), both to account for potential endogeneity and confoundedness issues. Regression results show a long-run positive effect of democracy on agricultural ODA. However, this relationship is nonlinear. The interaction between democracy and resources indicates that natural resource wealth mitigates the positive gains from democracy on agricultural ODA. The study concludes that, while democratic reforms enhance the effectiveness of foreign aid directed to the agricultural sector, this positive effect depends on the natural-resource wealth status of the country.

J	Oliver, C; Turnbull, J; Richardson, M				Oliver, Catherine; Turnbull, Jonathon; Richardson, Michael			Claiming veganism and vegan geographies	GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						disciplinary knowledge; research agendas; veganism	GENDER	A decade ago, veganism was a fringe radical movement. It was also largely absent from the geographical discipline, despite a rich history of vegan scholarship being present in disciplines such as Sociology and Psychology. However, veganism has recently seen a surge in popularity, with more people than ever before becoming vegan for a mixture of animal welfare, environmental, and health-based reasons. With this mainstreaming, veganism has become contentious and fiercely defended. As veganism has become a growing social and political force, geographers have started to take notice of this previously fringe movement, which is gaining economic, ecological, and cultural power as investment flows into 'plant-based' products and new markets are emerging. In this commentary, we look at how veganism has recently been taken up in Geography via several distinct trends that all stake a claim in defining an emerging geographical sub-discipline, vegan geographies. We note the importance of scholarly pluralism and attention to establishing geographical sub-disciplines more broadly.

The black TiO2-g-C3N4 wt% Co3S4/NC (TiCN-15% CoS/NC) NHAs exhibited high photocatalytic activity in degrading methylene blue. The synergetic effect of all components in black TiCN-x wt% CoS/NC NHAs resulted in efficient electron-hole pair separation and charge mobility on Co3S4/NC HNB and g-C3N4 surfaces, which led to a highly effective recombination rate of charge carriers and an excellent improvement in photocatalytic performance.

J	Sachdeva, B; Puri, S; Aeri, BT				Sachdeva, Barkha; Puri, Seema; Aeri, Bani Tamber			Environmental imprints of agricultural and livestock produce: A scoping review from South Asian countries	JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS			English	Review; Early Access						GHG emissions; South Asia; South Asian diets; sustainable diets	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; WATER FOOTPRINTS; INDIAN DIETS; LAND-USE; IMPACTS; RICE	BackgroundAgricultural activities in 2020 have resulted in 5.5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent globally, which is expected to rise because the food system would have to grow 70% more food for the population in 2050. Research suggests that agricultural productivity in South Asian countries, will increase food security; however, the role of their food crops and livestock products in environmental imprints is uncertain. This review aimed to assess the environmental impacts resulting from pre- and post-production agricultural activities related to edible food crops and livestock products consumed in eight South Asian countries.MethodsStudies were retrieved using three databases (PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct) from 2011 to 2022. The protocol for this scoping review was not registered.ResultsTwenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in India. Twenty-four articles assessed greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, followed by water footprints (n = 5), nitrogen and phosphorus (N&P) emissions (n = 4), and land requirements (n = 4). The production of rice and wheat was identified as a significant contributor to GHG emissions. In India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the production of livestock (meat/bovine/shrimp and milk) was reported to be harmful to the environment. Inconclusive data were retrieved for other environment variables.ConclusionsDiversification in food production and cultivating additional coarse cereals (millets) offer opportunities for GHG reduction. Nevertheless, more comprehensive and longitudinal studies for South Asian countries are essential to make precise conclusions and validate the present review. Diversification in food production and cultivating additional coarse cereals (millets) offer opportunities for green house gas (GHG) reduction in South Asian countries.image The present study explored the role of South Asian food crops and livestock in environmental degradation.Most studies assessed green house gas (GHG) emissions.Production of wheat, rice and livestock products contributed significantly to GHG emissions.Diversification in food production, cultivating coarse cereals such as millets is desirable.

Antibiotic use as a risk factor for irritable bowel syndrome: Results from a nationwide, case-control study	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article; Early Access							MICROBIOTA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; EXCRETION; REGISTER; DIARRHEA; THERAPY	Background: The microbiome plays an important role in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Antibiotic use can fundamentally alter gut microbial ecology. We examined the association of antibiotic use with IBS in a large population-based investigation.Methods: A case-control study with prospectively collected data on 29,111 adult patients diagnosed with IBS in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 matched with 135,172 controls. Using a comprehensive histopathology cohort, the Swedish Patient Register, and the Prescribed Drug Register, we identified all consecutive cases of IBS in addition to cumulative antibiotic dispensations accrued until 1 year prior to IBS (exclusionary period) for cases and time of matching for up to five general population controls matched on the basis of age, sex, country and calendar year. Conditional logistic regression estimated multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of IBS.Results: Patients with IBS (n = 29,111) were more likely than controls (n = 135,172) to have used antibiotics up to 1 year prior to diagnosis (74.9% vs. 57.8%). After multivariable adjustment, this translated to a more than twofold increased odds of IBS (OR 2.21, 95% CI 2.14-2.28) that did not differ according to age, sex, year of IBS diagnosis or IBS subtype. Compared to none, 1-2 (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.61-1.73) and >= 3 antibiotics dispensations (OR 3.36, 95% CI 3.24-3.49) were associated with increased odds of IBS (p for trend <0.001) regardless of the antibiotic class.Conclusions: Prior antibiotics use was associated with an increased odds of IBS with the highest risk among people with multiple antibiotics dispensations.

J	Tuncer, I; Kartal, AS				Tuncer, Ilhami; Kartal, Ahmet Selim			Do the importance of influencer- and customer-generated content on social media affect willingness to pay more for potential customers?	JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR			English	Article; Early Access							WORD-OF-MOUTH; SOURCE CREDIBILITY; INFORMATION QUALITY; MODERATING ROLE; TRUST; ANTECEDENTS; IMPACT; EWOM; PERSONALITY; ACCEPTANCE	The number of social media platforms and users have reached significant amounts. Users can interact with millions of other users by sharing their experiences and evaluations concerning the product/service they purchased on social media. This social media sharing can hence affect the purchasing decision processes of potential customers who are searching for information. Moreover, sharing from different sources such as influencers and customers may create differences in the importance the potential consumer attaches to the shared content. Since there is there is a gap in the existing literature, there is a need to explore these relationships. Consequently, we examined the relationship between information quality, willingness to pay more (WPM), source credibility, the importance attached to participant sharing (IPS), and the importance attached to non-participant sharing (INPS). A questionnaire designed to test this relationship was administered to 323 participants; the obtained data was then analyzed using partial least squares path modeling. According to the analysis results, we noted the emergence of a positive association of information quality with INPS and IPS (posts by both customers and influencers). In contrast, we discovered a relationship of source credibility with INPS (posts by both customers and influencers) and IPS (posts by influencers). In addition, the positive association of INPS (posts by both customers and influencers) and WPM was confirmed. These main findings indicate that e-commerce companies should persuade and encourage their customers and influencers to post from their profiles.

Ultimately, the instability issue is attributed to the soft lattice of ionic perovskite crystal. In brief, metal halide perovskite materials are susceptible to structural instability processes, including phase segregation, component loss, lattice distortion, and fatigue failure under harsh external stimuli such as high humidity, strong irradiation, wide thermal cycles, and large stress. Developing self-healing perovskites to further improve the unsatisfactory operational stability of their photoelectric devices under harsh stimuli has become a cutting-edge hotspot in this field. This self-healing behavior needs to be studied more comprehensively. Therefore, the self-healing behavior of the metal halide perovskites and photovoltaics is classified and summarized in this review. By discussing recent advances, underlying mechanisms, strategies, and existing challenges, this review provides perspectives on self-healing of perovskite solar cells in the future. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) encounter phase segregation, component loss, lattice distortion, and fatigue failure, impacting their operational stability. Developing self-healing perovskites to enhance stability under harsh stimuli is a prominent research focus. This review categorizes and summarizes PSCs' self-healing behavior, exploring recent advances, mechanisms, strategies, and challenges, and providing valuable insights for future studies.image	[Wang, Chenyun; Qu, Du; Zhou, Bin; Shang, Chuanzhen; Zhang, Xinyue; Tu, Yongguang; Huang, Wei] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Xian Inst Flexible Elect IFE, Frontiers Sci Ctr Flexible Elect FSCFE, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chenyun; Qu, Du; Zhou, Bin; Shang, Chuanzhen; Zhang, Xinyue; Tu, Yongguang; Huang, Wei] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Xian Inst Biomed Mat & Engn IBME, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei] Nanjing Tech Univ Nanjing, Key Lab Flexible Elect KLoFE, Nanjing 211816, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei] NanjingTech Univ, Inst Adv Mat IAM, Jiangsu Natl Synerget Innovat Ctr Adv Mat SICAM, Nanjing 211816, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun NUPT, Key Lab Organ Elect & Informat Displays KLOEID, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wei] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Inst Adv Mat IAM, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Tu, Yongguang; Huang, Wei] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ningbo Inst, Key Lab Flexible Elect Zhejiang Provience, 218 Qingyi Rd, Ningbo 315103, Peoples R China	Northwestern Polytechnical University; Northwestern Polytechnical University; Nanjing Tech University; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Northwestern Polytechnical University	Tu, YG (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Xian Inst Flexible Elect IFE, Frontiers Sci Ctr Flexible Elect FSCFE, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Tu, YG (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Xian Inst Biomed Mat & Engn IBME, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Tu, YG (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Ningbo Inst, Key Lab Flexible Elect Zhejiang Provience, 218 Qingyi Rd, Ningbo 315103, Peoples R China.	iamygtu@nwpu.edu.cn	Tu, Yongguang/U-9756-2017	Tu, Yongguang/0000-0002-1402-4148	This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62004165) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Developing oral chronotherapy for cortisol replacement in congenital adrenal hyperplasia	CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						adrenal insufficiency; chronotherapy; congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia	MODIFIED-RELEASE HYDROCORTISONE; EXPOSURE; THERAPY; FORMULATION; SYSTEM; ADULTS; SLEEP; SERUM	The sun imposes a 24-h periodicity to life and circadian rhythms have evolved to maintain homoeostasis through the day/night cycle. In humans, there is a central clock that controls the sleep/wake cycle which is paralleled metabolically by a fast/feed cycle. The clock maintains homoeostasis by synchronising metabolism to the time of feeding. Loss of synchrony between the clock and hormonal rhythms results in loss of homoeostasis as evidenced by obesity, depression, and diabetes in people undertaking shift work. Cortisol has a distinct circadian rhythm; peaking on waking and low at sleep onset. Loss of this rhythm in adrenal insufficiency is associated with a poor quality of life and increased mortality. To replace the cortisol rhythm requires chronotherapy and for this you need to define the key parameters of the target rhythm, create a formulation to replicate that rhythm, and then prove clinical benefit. The physiology of hormones is more complex than that of nonnative drugs. Hormones are secreted with varied rhythms, bound to multiple cognate binding proteins, and actively transported and cleared through enzymatic pathways in multiple organs. We have examined the diurnal rhythm of cortisol in healthy volunteers, created physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models, and tested various oral delayed and sustained formulations of hydrocortisone (development name, Chronocort) in clinical trials. The outcome from this work was the manufacture of modified-release hydrocortisone hard capsules (tradename Efmody, Diurnal Ltd), that replicate the cortisol diurnal rhythm and improve the disease control of congenital adrenal hyperplasia the commonest hereditary form of adrenal insufficiency.

Despite a long research history, there remains considerable controversy about the maximum ice-sheet extent and the expansion of proglacial lakes within the Severnaya Dvina fluvial system. The goal of this study was to address these issues using new material from the valleys of the Severnaya Dvina and the lower Vychegda, thereby contributing to an understanding of the history of the south-eastern sector of the last Scandinavian Ice Sheet and its periglacial areas. We studied a number of geological sections using radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, pollen and carpological analyses, and found that the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) proglacial lake occupied the Severnaya Dvina valley between 20-19 ka and about 15.5 ka. The lake was localized within the proglacial isostatic depression and occupied only the Severnaya Dvina valley extending no further than the confluence of the Vychegda River, no more than 110 km from the edge of the ice sheet. The lake formation did not cause any drainage reorganization within and outside the Vychegda fluvial system. Given the small size of the lake and presence of the oldest OSL ages along the entire length of the former lake, we suggest that the onset of the proglacial lake marks the maximum extent of the ice sheet in the area. Consequently, the onset of the local LGM may be dated to 20-19 ka, somewhat earlier than assumed by most previous researchers. The LGM ice sheet boundary was located in the Severnaya Dvina valley downstream from the Vychegda confluence and did not extend into the Vychegda valley, despite previous suggestions. During deglaciation, the lake disappearance together with crustal rebound caused an incision episode in the Vychegda - Severnaya Dvina system and the formation of the Lateglacial alluvial terrace with relative height rising downstream due to the uneven rates of the postglacial uplift.

Wang, et al. Org. Lett. 2019, 21, 5285-5289). In this work, the detailed reaction mechanisms of such a unique carbonyl-supported tetracoordinate boron system in the first excited singlet (S1) state and the ground (S0) state were investigated by using the complete active space self-consistent field and its second-order perturbation (MS-CASPT2//CASSCF) method combined with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). Moreover, an imine-substituted tetracoordinated organic boron system (BNMes2) was selected for comparative study to explore the intrinsic reasons for the difference in reactivity between the two types of compounds. Steric factor was found to influence the photoisomerization activity of BNMes2 and BOMes2. These results rationalize the experimental observations and can provide helpful insights into understanding the excited-state dynamics of heteroatom-doped tetracoordinate organoboron compounds, which facilitates the rational design of boron-based materials with superior photoresponsive performances. MS-CASPT2//CASSCF calculations reveal detailed mechanisms for the photoisomerization of boron compounds, showing that the steric hindrance influences their photoisomerization activity.image	[Zhu, Hong-Yang; Li, Quan-Song] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Cluster Sci, Beijing Key Lab Photoelect Electrophoton Convers M, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing, Peoples R China	Beijing Institute of Technology	Li, QS (corresponding author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Cluster Sci, Beijing Key Lab Photoelect Electrophoton Convers M, 5 South Zhongguancun St, Beijing, Peoples R China.	liquansong@bit.edu.cn		Li, Quansong/0000-0002-1462-5410	<italic>This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22173008 and 21773007)</italic>.

Seed oil content and composition largely determine the economic value of soybean. Due to natural genetic variation, seed oil content varies substantially across soybean cultivars. Although much progress has been made in elucidating the genetic trajectory underlying fatty acid metabolism and oil biosynthesis in plants, the causal genes for many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regulating seed oil content in soybean remain to be revealed. In this study, we identified GmFATA1B as the gene underlying a QTL that regulates seed oil content and composition, as well as seed size in soybean. Nine extra amino acids in the conserved region of GmFATA1B impair its function as a fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase, thereby affecting seed oil content and composition. Heterogeneously overexpressing the functional GmFATA1B allele in Arabidopsis thaliana increased both the total oil content and the oleic acid and linoleic acid contents of seeds. Our findings uncover a previously unknown locus underlying variation in seed oil content in soybean and lay the foundation for improving seed oil content and composition in soybean.

The aim of this study was to investigate the value of whole-exome sequencing (WES) in detecting genetic abnormalities for fetuses with isolated first-trimester increased NT.MethodsAfter the exclusion of aneuploidies and pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) by quantitative fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (QF-PCR) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), WES was performed on 63 fetuses with isolated first-trimester increased NT (& GE;3.5 mm).ResultsOverall, WES yielded a 4.8% (3/63) diagnostic rate for fetuses with isolated increased NT. Pathogenic variants were identified in 37.5% (3/8) fetuses that developed additional structural anomalies later in gestation, and no pathogenic variants were detected in increased NT that resolved or remained isolated throughout the pregnancy.ConclusionThis study provides powerful evidence to offer prenatal WES for increased NT only when additional abnormalities are present. Early detailed ultrasound to detect emerging anomalies can help physicians offer prenatal WES to fetuses with a greater likelihood of diagnosis. WES yielded a 4.8% (3/63) diagnostic rate for fetuses with isolated increased NT. Pathogenic variants were identified in 37.5% (3/8) fetuses that developed additional structural anomalies later in gestation, and no pathogenic variants were detected in increased NT that resolved or remained isolated throughout the pregnancy. Our study provides powerful evidence to offer prenatal WES for increased NT only when additional abnormalities are present.image	[Cao, Chunge; Zhang, Qing] Zhengzhou Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Prenatal Diag Ctr, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Fang] Chongqing Maternal & Child Healthcare Hosp, Prenatal Diag Ctr, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yan] Sichuan Univ, West China Univ Hosp 2, Prenatal Diag Ctr, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xinhong] Maternal & Child Healthcare Hosp Longhua Dist, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China	Zhengzhou University; Sichuan University	Liu, XH (corresponding author), Maternal & Child Healthcare Hosp Longhua Dist, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.	491044114@qq.com			We are grateful to our patients for their sincere participation in this study.

However, endogenous FA can have several negative effects on the body through epigenetic alterations, including cancer growth promotion; neuronal, hippocampal and endothelial damages; atherosclerosis acceleration; haemopoietic stem cell destruction and haemopoietic cell production reduction. Certain medications with antioxidant effects, such as glutathione, vitamin E, resveratrol, alpha lipoic acid and polyphenols, lessen the detrimental effects of endogenous FA by reducing oxidative stress, directly scavenging endogenous FA or promoting its degradation. This study offers fresh perspectives for managing illnesses associated with endogenous FA exposure. This article reviews the physiological and pathological mechanisms underlying the production and metabolism of endogenous formaldehyde, as well as its bidirectional regulatory effects on the human body. Finally, drugs that eliminate endogenous formaldehyde are summarized. This review provides a new perspective on how to treat diseases caused by endogenous formaldehyde in the future.

Good to excellent isolated yields are achieved by applying a PNP manganese pincer complex. In the reaction, 1,2-dihydroquinoline is detected as intermediate by NMR spectra analysis and deuterium labelling experiment. The catalytic reaction likely proceeded by an outer-sphere pathway based on the bifunctional pincer complex. A PNP pincer manganese complex was applied as catalyst for transfer hydrogenation of quinolines with ammonia borane as hydrogen source. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroquinolines were obtained under mild conditions with good to excellent yields. 1,2-Dihydroquinolines were detected by 1H NMR in the progress and isotopic labelling experiments were performed to determine the destination of ammonia-borane hydrogen atoms.image	[Chu, Xiaoxiao; Zhou, Guoren; Pang, Maofu; Zhang, Hongwu] Ludong Univ, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China	Ludong University	Pang, MF; Zhang, HW (corresponding author), Ludong Univ, Sch Chem & Mat Sci, Yantai 264025, Peoples R China.	pmf1991@163.com; hwzhang@iue.ac.cn			This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22001107), National Science Foundation of Shandong Province (No. ZR2022QB036).and Shandong Laboratory of Advanced Materials and Green Manufacturing at Yantai (No. AMGM2023F11).

The optimum condition in the process of selective extraction of polymethoxylated flavones from Citrus peel by matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) was as follows: SBA-15 as adsorbent, ethyl acetate as eluent, the mass ratio of adsorbent to sample 1:1, and the mixture of sample and adsorbent was ground for 3 min. Twelve antioxidants were successfully screened by micro-fractionation bioactivity evaluation assay, in which four of them were flavonoid glycosides, seven of them were polymethoxylated flavones, and one was phenylpropanoid. 1-sinapoly-beta-D-glucopyranoside (1) was reported for the first time in Citrus peel. And antioxidant capacity of 1-sinapoly-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 5, 7, 8, 3', 4', 5'-hexamethoxyflavone (6), hexamethoxyflavone (11), and 5, 6, 7, 4'-tetramethoxyflavone (7) were reported for the first time. Nobiletin (compound 8), 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3', 4'-heptamethoxyflavone (9) and tangeretin (10) were isolated and purified by countercurrent chromatography combined with preparative liquid chromatography. Antioxidant activity evaluation indicated that the three isolated polymethoxylated flavones owned similar antioxidant activity. This study indicated that MSPD combined with micro-fractionation bioactive evaluation was efficient in screening bioactive compounds for rapid extraction and effective pinpointing bioactive substances in natural products.

Asymmetrical exchanges of species between regions are likely influenced by a range of mechanisms, including propagule pressure, native species pools, environmental conditions and biosecurity. While the importance of different mechanisms is likely to vary among invasion stages, those occurring prior to establishment (transport and introduction) are difficult to account for. We used records of unintentional insect introductions to test (1) whether insects from some biogeographic regions are more likely to be successful invaders, (2) whether the intensity of trade flows between regions determines how many species are intercepted and how many successfully establish, and (3) whether the variables driving successful transport and successful establishment differ.LocationCanada, mainland USA, Hawaii, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain, South Korea, South Africa.MethodsTo disentangle processes occurring during the transport and establishment stages, we analysed border interceptions of 8199 insect species as a proxy for transported species flows, and lists of 2076 established non-native insect species in eight areas. We investigated the influence of biogeographic variables, socio-economic variables and biosecurity regulations on the size of species flows between regions.ResultsDuring transport, the largest species flows generally originated from the Nearctic, Panamanian and Neotropical regions. Insects native to 8 of 12 biogeographic regions were able to establish, with the largest flows of established species on average coming from the Western Palearctic, Neotropical and Australasian/Oceanian regions. Both the biogeographic region of origin and trade intensity significantly influenced the size of species flows between regions during transport and establishment. The transported species richness increased with Gross National Income in the source country, and decreased with geographic distance. More species were able to establish when introduced within their native biogeographic region.Main ConclusionsOur results suggest that accounting for processes occurring prior to establishment is crucial for understanding invasion asymmetry in insects, and for quantifying regional biosecurity risks.

J	Hartless, J				Hartless, Jaime			Insider-allies: The precarious politics of men in identity-fluid feminism	SOCIOLOGY COMPASS			English	Article; Early Access						feminism; identity politics; masculinities; social movements	MASCULINITIES; VIOLENCE; RIGHTS	Academic and activist conversations about the position of men in feminism often operate under the assumption that women are the movement's key beneficiaries and men are privileged outsiders lending their support. I use 59 interviews from a broader project on feminist and LGBTQ+ activism in the United States to illustrate how men's orientation to feminism is shaped by whether social movement organizations adopt what I call woman-centered or identity-fluid politics. While woman-centered politics treat men as allies whose intentions must be vetted by women, identity-fluid feminism imagines men as insiders with their own independent investment in the movement. I argue that the tension between these two models of identity politics gives men a liminal "insider-ally" position within feminism. Although feminist men are given a tentative authority to speak for the movement, the persistence of woman-centered understandings of feminism means men's insider status is contested, especially when they dominate feminist spaces, compromise women's sense of safety, and seek leadership.

The behavior of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) and immune cells influences the establishment of a microenvironment that promotes cancer cell metastasis in the peritoneum. Here, we investigated the roles of lactosylceramide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (ST3G5; also known as ST3GAL5 and GM3 synthase) in the exosome-mediated premetastatic niche in peritoneal milky spots (MSs). Exosomes secreted from ST3G5(high) cancer cells (ST3G5(high)-cExos) were found to contain high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a) and accumulated in MSs via uptake in macrophages (Mfs) owing to increased expression of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 1 (CD169; also known as SIGLEC1). ST3G5(high)-cExos induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and glucose metabolic changes in Mfs, and the interaction of these Mfs with PMCs promoted mesothelial-mesenchymal transition (MMT) in PMCs, thereby generating aSMA(+) myofibroblasts. ST3G5(high)-cExos also increased the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and T-cell exhaustion in MSs, which accelerated metastasis to the omentum. These events were prevented following ST3G5 depletion in cancer cells. Mechanistically, ST3G5(high)-cExos upregulated chemokines, including CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), in recipient Mfs and dendritic cells (DCs), which induced MMT and immunosuppression via activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Maraviroc, a C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist, prevented ST3G5(high)-cExo-mediated MMT, T-cell suppression, and metastasis in MSs. Our results suggest ST3G5 as a suitable therapeutic target for preventing cExo-mediated peritoneal dissemination.

Vegetation can, in turn, play a role in regulating soil microclimate, which creates potential for powerful and interactive feedbacks from soil and vegetation on the atmosphere. Although the regulatory effect of vegetation on soil microclimatic conditions has been quite extensively and empirically assessed, most studies have determined the net effect of intact woody vegetation versus bare ground. However, for other plant functional groups we lack a clear understanding of their role and any climate-context dependency in controlling microclimatic conditions.We investigated the role of three major plant functional groups - graminoids, forbs and bryophytes - in regulating soil microclimate in semi-natural alpine grasslands. Using a fully factorial above-ground biomass removal experiment, we assessed the role of these plant functional groups in regulating soil temperature amplitude, soil moisture, and number of freezing days. The experiment was replicated across orthogonal temperature and precipitation gradients in Norway to assess whether the effects of functional group abundance varied with climate.The effect of plant biomass on soil microclimate varied among functional groups across the climatic gradients. Bryophytes reduced growing season soil temperature, whereas graminoids and forbs did not (0.5oC compared to 0oC), and with a stronger effect in colder climates at higher elevations and on days with high solar radiation. Bryophyte biomass further reduced the number of soil freezing days at boreal and sub-alpine sites. Finally, graminoid biomass partly explained variation in soil moisture: soils dried more under graminoids at drier sites.Our findings highlight that functional group identity plays a key role in regulating soil microclimate in alpine grasslands across seasons. The strong effect of bryophytes on soil temperature points to their importance in the plant community for a variety of ecosystem functions, some of which may be indirectly vulnerable to future warming via biomass reductions of bryophytes.

Conventional measurement-based patient-specific QA (pQA) can only verify limited aspects of patient treatment and is labor-intensive. Thus, a better method is needed to ensure the integrity of the treatment plan.PurposeLine scanning, which involves continuous and rapid delivery of pencil beams, is a state-of-the-art proton therapy technique. Machine performance in delivering scanning protons is dependent on the complexity of the beam modulations. Moreover, it contributes to patient treatment accuracy. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation-based QA method that reflects the uncertainty related to the machine during scanning beam delivery was developed and verified for clinical applications to pQA.MethodsHerein, a tool for particle simulation (TOPAS) for nozzle modeling was used, and the code was commissioned against the measurements. To acquire the beam delivery uncertainty for each plan, patient plans were delivered. Furthermore, log files recorded every 60 & mu;s by the monitors downstream of the nozzle were exported from the treatment control system. The spot positions and monitor unit (MU) counts in the log files were converted to dipole magnet strengths and number of particles, respectively, and entered into the TOPAS. For the 68 clinical cases, MC simulations were performed in a solid water phantom, and two-dimensional (2D) absolute dose distributions at 20-mm depth were measured using an ionization chamber array (Octavius 1500, PTW, Freiburg, Germany). Consequently, the MC-simulated 2D dose distributions were compared with the measured data, and the dose distributions in the pre-treatment QA plan created with RayStation (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden). Absolute dose comparisons were made using gamma analysis with 3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm criteria for 47 clinical cases without considering daily machine output variation in the MC simulation and 21 cases with daily output variation, respectively. All cases were analyzed with 90% or 95% of passing rate thresholds.ResultsFor 47 clinical cases not considering daily output variations, the absolute gamma passing rates compared with the pre-treatment QA plan were 99.71% and 96.97%, and the standard deviations (SD) were 0.70% and 3.78% with the 3%/3 mm or 2%/2 mm criteria, respectively. Compared with the measurements, the passing rate of 2%/2 mm gamma criterion was 96.76% with 3.99% of SD. For the 21 clinical cases compared with pre-treatment QA plan data and measurements considering daily output variations, the 2%/2 mm absolute gamma analysis result was 98.52% with 1.43% of SD and 97.67% with 2.72% of SD, respectively. With a 95% passing rate threshold of 2%/2 mm criterion, the false-positive and false-negative were 21.8% and 8.3% for without and with considering output variation, respectively. With a 90% threshold, the false-positive and false-negative reduced to 11.4% and 0% for without and with considering output variation, respectively.ConclusionsA log-file-based MC simulation method for patient QA of line-scanning proton therapy was successfully developed. The proposed method exhibited clinically acceptable accuracy, thereby exhibiting a potential to replace the measurement-based dosimetry QA method with a 90% gamma passing rate threshold when applying the 2%/2 mm criterion.

Baseline data were collected before the Brazilian COVID-19 outbreak (T1). Posteriorly, data were collected after 3 (T2) and 15 months under the Brazilian COVID-19 outbreak. The possible SB was evaluated by the question: 'Do you grind your teeth during your sleep?'. Sociodemographic, psychosocial and clinical variables were also collected. Changes in SB were evaluated by multilevel logistic regression models for repeated measures.ResultsOf the 290 adolescents assessed at T1, 182 were reassessed at both follow-ups. The prevalence of possible SB was 13% at T1, 11% at T2 and 22% at T3. There were no immediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence of possible SB (T2). Adolescents had odds 2.77 times greater of presented possible SB after 15 months (T3) of COVID-19 pandemic scenarios when compared to T1.ConclusionThere was a considerable and late increase in the possible SB in adolescents in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aim to systematically review the efficacy of MISS MLS for patients with OSA, as well as the clinical outcomes and possible complications in OSA patients before and after MISS MLS.Design and settingSystematic review and meta-analysis. Six databases were searched, and the PRISMA guideline was followed.ParticipantsPatients with OSA receiving MISS MLS.Main outcome measuresThe random-effects model was adopted for the statistical synthesis. The percentage and 95% confidence interval (CI) were adopted as the effect measurements of MISS MLS for OSA. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also performed to identify the heterogeneity among the studies.ResultsThere were initially 154 articles for identification. Eventually, six studies with a total of 848 OSA patients completely met the inclusion criteria and were further enrolled for analysis. The pooled analysis showed statistically significant lower AHI (apnea/hypopnea index, /hr.; mean difference: -8.931, 95% CI: -11.591 to -6.271, I2 = 87.4%), ESS (mean difference: -2.947, 95% CI: -4.465 to -1.429, I2 = 94.9%), and snoring severity with 0-10 visual analog scale after surgery (mean difference: -4.966, 95% CI: -5.804 to -4.128, I2 = 96.4%). The success rate was 46% in mild/moderate OSA; however, 18% in severe OSA. There were no major complications occurred.ConclusionsThe acceptable surgical outcomes, esp. in mild/moderate OSA, and rare complications are the major advantages of MISS MLS. The evidence of this study could aid the decision making in selecting suitable treatment programs for OSA patients.

Unfortunately, their long-term stability is low, which limits the variety of in vitro applications. To overcome this problem and achieve better hydrolytic stability of 3D gingival models, fibrin-based hydrogel blends with increased long-term stability in vitro are investigated. Two different fibrin-based hydrogels are tested: fibrin 2.5% (w/v) and fibrin 1% (w/v)/gelatin 5% (w/v). Appropriate numbers of primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and OKG4/bmi1/TERT (OKG) keratinocytes are optimized to achieve a homogeneous distribution of cells under the assumed 3D conditions. Both hydrogels support the viability of HGFs and the stability of the hydrogel over 28 days. In vitro cultivation at the air-liquid interface triggers keratinization of the epithelium and increases its thickness, allowing the formation of multiple tissue-like layers. The presence of HGFs in the hydrogel further enhances epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, a fibrin-based 3D gingival model mimics the histology of native gingiva in vitro and ensures its long-term stability in comparison with the previously reported collagen paralogs. These results open new perspectives for extending the period within which specific biological or pathological conditions of artificial gingival tissue can be evaluated. Fibrin-based hydrogel blends increase the long-term stability of the in vitro full gingival model up to 28 days. Histologically, this 3D model mimics the histology of native gingiva in vitro by supporting the growth of primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and the differentiation of OKG4/bmi1/TERT (OKG) keratinocyte cell line to a stratified epithelium.image	[Sahle, Maike; Wachendoerfer, Mattis; Palkowitz, Alena L.; Nasehi, Ramin; Aveic, Sanja; Fischer, Horst] RWTH Aachen Univ Hosp, Dept Dent Mat & Biomat Res, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany	RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University Hospital	Aveic, S; Fischer, H (corresponding author), RWTH Aachen Univ Hosp, Dept Dent Mat & Biomat Res, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.	saveic@ukaachen.de; hfischer@ukaachen.de	Aveic, Sanja/J-9456-2014	Aveic, Sanja/0000-0002-3886-4360; Fischer, Horst/0000-0003-0990-5028	Open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

A case of fatal overdose involving both hydromorphone and kratom	JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						forensic toxicology; herbal supplement; hydromorphone; kratom; mitragynine; renal insufficiency		Kratom is a plant originating in Southeast Asia that has been used for its dose-dependent stimulant and opioid effects. The main active compound in kratom is mitragynine, an alkaloid with affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Toxicity and fatalities related to kratom use have increased substantially in recent years. In this case report, we describe a 44-year-old man who was found deceased in bed. The only significant finding at autopsy was abdominal distension with >4 L of ascites. Toxicology testing was performed on femoral blood which showed 79 ng/mL of hydromorphone, 560 ng/mL of mitragynine, and 240 ng/mL of olanzapine. In addition, creatinine and urea in vitreous humor were significantly elevated, consistent with renal impairment. Death was attributed to hydromorphone toxicity with mitragynine being a contributing factor.

Fundamental Neurochemistry Review: Microglial immunometabolism in traumatic brain injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Review; Early Access						metabolism; microglia; mitochondria; neuroimmunology; traumatic brain injury	ACTIVATED-RECEPTOR-GAMMA; MITOCHONDRIAL OXIDATIVE DAMAGE; ROTENONE-INDUCED DEGENERATION; PENTOSE-PHOSPHATE PATHWAY; TRICARBOXYLIC-ACID CYCLE; NADPH OXIDASE; KETOGENIC DIET; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; TYPE-4 ALLELE	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a devastating neurological disorder caused by a physical impact to the brain that promotes diffuse damage and chronic neurodegeneration. Key mechanisms believed to support secondary brain injury include mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic neuroinflammation. Microglia and brain-infiltrating macrophages are responsible for neuroinflammatory cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after TBI. Their production is associated with loss of homeostatic microglial functions such as immunosurveillance, phagocytosis, and immune resolution. Beyond providing energy support, mitochondrial metabolic pathways reprogram the pro- and anti-inflammatory machinery in immune cells, providing a critical immunometabolic axis capable of regulating immunologic response to noxious stimuli. In the brain, the capacity to adapt to different environmental stimuli derives, in part, from microglia's ability to recognize and respond to changes in extracellular and intracellular metabolite levels. This capacity is met by an equally plastic metabolism, capable of altering immune function. Microglial pro-inflammatory activation is associated with decreased mitochondrial respiration, whereas anti-inflammatory microglial polarization is supported by increased oxidative metabolism. These metabolic adaptations contribute to neuroimmune responses, placing mitochondria as a central regulator of post-traumatic neuroinflammation. Although it is established that profound neurometabolic changes occur following TBI, key questions related to metabolic shifts in microglia remain unresolved. These include (a) the nature of microglial mitochondrial dysfunction after TBI, (b) the hierarchical positions of different metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glutaminolysis, and lipid oxidation during secondary injury and recovery, and (c) how immunometabolism alters microglial phenotypes, culminating in chronic non-resolving neuroinflammation. In this basic neurochemistry review article, we describe the contributions of immunometabolism to TBI, detail primary evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic impairments in microglia and macrophages, discuss how major metabolic pathways contribute to post-traumatic neuroinflammation, and set out future directions toward advancing immunometabolic phenotyping in TBI.image In this fundamental neurochemistry review, we examine the relationship between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and immune cell metabolism, primarily focusing on microglia. TBI leads to widespread damage and chronic neurodegeneration, with secondary brain injury involving mitochondrial dysfunction and ongoing neuroinflammation. Microglia contribute to inflammation via cytokine and reactive oxygen species production chronically post-TBI, and promote long-term neurodegeneration. Metabolic pathways in these cells regulate immune responses, with metabolic adaptations driving pro- or anti-inflammatory states. However, questions about microglial mitochondrial dysfunction, the roles of specific metabolic pathways, and how immunometabolism influences chronic neuroinflammation following TBI remain. The review explores these aspects to advance understanding of immunometabolic changes in TBI.image	[Strogulski, Nathan R.; Loane, David J.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Biomed Sci Inst, Sch Biochem & Immunol, Dublin, Ireland; [Portela, Luis V.] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Neurotrauma & Biomarkers Lab, Inst Ciencias Bas Saude, Porto Alegre, Brazil; [Polster, Brian M.; Loane, David J.] Univ Maryland, Trauma & Anesthesiol Res Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol & Shock, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD USA	Trinity College Dublin; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore	Strogulski, NR; Loane, DJ (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Trinity Biomed Sci Inst, Sch Biochem & Immunol, Dublin, Ireland.	ryzewskn@tcd.ie; loanedj@tcd.ie		Portela, Luis Valmor/0000-0001-6113-8466; Strogulski, Nathan/0000-0003-2166-2137	Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [4011645/2012-6, 5465346/2014-6]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [19/25510000717-5]; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul [1010267, 16/2551-0000499-4, 17/2551-0001]; Irish Research Council [GOIPD/2022/792]; National Institutes of Health [NS112212, NS122777]; Science Foundation Ireland [SFI17/FRL/4860]	Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul(Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS)); Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Science Foundation Ireland(Science Foundation Ireland)	Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 4011645/2012-6 and 5465346/2014-6; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior, Grant/Award Number: 19/25510000717-5; Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, Grant/Award Number: 1010267, 16/2551-0000499-4 and 17/2551-0001; Irish Research Council, Grant/Award Number: GOIPD/2022/792; National Institutes of Health, Grant/Award Number: NS112212 and NS122777; Science Foundation Ireland, Grant/Award Number: SFI17/FRL/4860		239	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0022-3042	1471-4159		J NEUROCHEM	J.

Due to the increasing demand for pharmaceutical proteins such as insulin and monoclonal antibodies, it has become essential to optimize the current industrial processes to meet these demands. There are various comparisons to be made between current batch crystallization processes and continuous processes for proteins. This review paper aims to review the recent advancements in continuous protein crystallization processes, such as slug flow crystallizers, oscillatory baffled crystallizers, and mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) crystallizers. Continuous crystallization of proteins is a crucial step in the rapid development of drugs and understanding the molecular mechanisms of various biological processes. Continuous crystallization is a valuable tool for advancing structural biology and drug development research by producing high-quality protein crystals. It offers several advantages over batch crystallization, such as high throughput, uniform product characteristics, and amenable scale-up.image	[Vikram, M.

J	Weissert, R				Weissert, Robert			Nervous system-related tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and autoimmunity in COVID-19 infection	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						COVID-19; Lymphocyte; Nervous system; Post-COVID; SARS-CoV-2	CELLS; NEUROPATHOLOGY; INVOLVEMENT; PATHOLOGY	The effects of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 on the nervous system are incompletely understood. SARS-CoV-2 can infect endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes with consequences for the host. There are indications that infection of these CNS-resident cells may result in long-term effects, including emergence of neurodegenerative diseases. Indirect effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 relate to the induction of autoimmune disease involving molecular mimicry or/and bystander activation of T- and B cells and emergence of autoantibodies against various self-antigens. Data obtained in preclinical models of coronavirus-induced disease gives important clues for the understanding of nervous system-related assault of SARS-CoV-2. The pathophysiology of long-COVID syndrome and post-COVID syndrome in which autoimmunity and immune dysregulation might be the driving forces are still incompletely understood. A better understanding of nervous-system-related immunity in COVID-19 might support the development of therapeutic approaches. In this review, the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the nervous system, the associated immune responses, and diseases are summarized. The data indicates that there is viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system resulting in various disease conditions. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection by means of vaccination is currently the best strategy for the prevention of subsequent tissue damage involving the nervous system. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding neurotropism and emerging immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are direct and indirect effects on the nervous system by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Presently, vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is the most effective way of preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nervous system.image	[Weissert, Robert] Univ Regensburg Hosp, Dept Neurol, Regensburg, Germany	University of Regensburg	Weissert, R (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg Hosp, Dept Neurol, Regensburg, Germany.	robert.weissert@ukr.de			Open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

Manipulating the carrier separation and recombination processes is critical to achieve high device efficiency. Compared to the conventional planar heterojunction (PHJ), the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration affords great potential to enable efficient charge extraction. In this work, BHJ Sb-2(S,Se)(3) solar cells are constructed based on CdS nanorod arrays (NRAs). Highly ordered CdS NRAs with appropriate nanorod lengths and diameters are obtained by regulating the growth environment and screening different substrates for CdS deposition. A low-temperature oxygen doping strategy implemented on CdS NRAs is further developed to improve the optoelectronic and defect properties as well as form a favorable cascade band structure for CdS NRAs, so as to realize more efficient charge extraction and suppressed recombination at the heterointerface. As a result, the CdS NRAs-based superstrated BHJ Sb-2(S,Se)(3) solar cell yields a considerable power conversion efficiency of 8.04%, outperforming that of the PHJ device. A careful comparative study of PHJ and BHJ based on electrostatic field simulations indicates that the BHJ allows more efficient charge extraction and transport. This work highlights the great potential of BHJ configuration for constructing high-performance antimony chalcogenide solar cells.

Only recently, however, have we begun to investigate how polyploidy influences interactions of plants with other species, despite the biotic niche being predicted as one of the main determinants of polyploid establishment. Nevertheless, we lack information about how polyploidy affects the diversity and composition of the microbial taxa that colonize plants, and whether this is genotype-dependent and repeatable across natural environments. This information is a first step towards understanding whether the microbiome contributes to polyploid establishment. We, thus, tested the immediate effect of polyploidy on the diversity and composition of the bacterial microbiome of the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrhiza using four pairs of diploids and synthetic autotetraploids. Under controlled conditions, axenic plants were inoculated with pond waters collected from 10 field sites across a broad environmental gradient. Autotetraploids hosted 4%-11% greater bacterial taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity than their diploid progenitors. Polyploidy, along with its interactions with the inoculum source and genetic lineage, collectively explained 7% of the total variation in microbiome composition. Furthermore, polyploidy broadened the core microbiome, with autotetraploids having 15 unique bacterial taxa in addition to the 55 they shared with diploids. Our results show that whole-genome duplication directly leads to novelty in the plant microbiome and importantly that the effect is dependent on the genetic ancestry of the polyploid and generalizable over many environmental contexts.

Investigating the robustness and relevance of an evidence-based sense-making construct to bridge the research-practice gap in cross-sector partnerships	BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						automated content analysis; best practice; cross-sector partnerships; partnership model; practitioner interviews; research-practice gap	PUBLIC-PRIVATE-PARTNERSHIPS; VALUE CREATION; HEALTH; SUSTAINABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; GOVERNANCE; EXPERIENCE; INNOVATION; ECONOMIES; LESSONS	Cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) are important for tackling development challenges across public, private, and non-profit sectors. Despite their growing prevalence as partnership models of choice for grand challenge efforts, there is little evidence-based understanding about the dominant features of these engagements. This makes it difficult to develop CSP engagement models that are useful across development problems and settings. We posit that CSPs are intrinsically cross-disciplinary endeavors and require collaboration models that enable interdisciplinary problem orientation and solution casting. To facilitate sense-making in partnership efforts, a CSP engagement model must therefore integrate perspectives on partnership from major disciplines and practitioner experiences. Using automated content analysis of peer-reviewed publications and manual content analysis of practitioner interviews, we explored the robustness and relevance of partnership capacity theory (PCT), an interdisciplinary CSP engagement model, as an evidence-based approach to CSP with best-practice grounding. We found PCT comprehensively characterizes collaborative CSP dynamics and offers a foundational view of CSP best practices.

To explore the potential advantage of underreporting her insurable losses, the insured follows a barrier strategy and only reports lossses above the barrier to the insurer. We obtain a unique equilibrium declaration strategy in closed form for a risk-neutral insured who maximizes her expected wealth, and in semiclosed form for a risk-averse insured who maximizes her expected exponential utility of wealth, both over an exogenous random horizon. We find that the equilibrium barriers for the two classes are equal and strictly greater than zero, offering a theoretical explanation for the underreporting of insurable losses, a form of ex post moral hazard. Finally, we consider the case of three rate classes and show, through numerical examples, that the equilibrium barriers are not equal.

Significant resistive losses and intrinsic defects are major obstacles to the scaling up of OHP-based PEC systems, leading to the PEC performance degradation of large-scale OHP photoelectrodes. Herein, a scalable design of the OHP-based PEC systems by modularization of the optimized OHP photoelectrodes exhibiting a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 10.4% is suggested. As a proof-of-concept, the OHP-based PEC module achieves an optimal PEC performance by avoiding major obstacles in the scaling up of the OHP photoelectrodes. The constructed OHP module is composed of a total of 16 OHP photoelectrodes, and a photocurrent of 11.52 mA is achieved under natural sunlight without external bias. The successful operation of unassisted solar water splitting using the OHP module without external bias can provide insights into the design of scalable OHP-based PEC systems for future practical application and commercialization. Organometal halide perovskite (OHP)-based photoelectrochemical (PEC) module is introduced as a new approach for scalable design of OHP-based PEC system and characterized under outdoor conditions for real-world verification in this study. The 4 cm2 active area of OHP PEC module exhibits a photocurrent of 11.52 mA without external bias under natural sunlight.image	[Choi, Hojoong; Jung, Yoonsung; Kim, Yejoon; Lee, Sanghan] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Seo, Sehun; Toma, Francesca] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Chem Sci Div, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Seo, Sehun; Toma, Francesca] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Liquid Sunlight Alliance, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Seo, Sehun; Toma, Francesca] Helmholtz Zent Hereon, Inst Funct Mat Sustainabil, Kantstr 55, D-14513 Teltow, Germany; [Yoon, Chang Jae; Ahn, Jae-Bin; Kim, Chan-Sol; Kim, Heejoo] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Res Inst Solar & Sustainable Energies, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Kim, Heejoo] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Integrated Technol, Grad Sch Energy Convergence, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Lee, Sanghan] Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Innovat Energy & Carbon Optimized Synth Ch, Gwangju 61005, South Korea	Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST); Gwangju Institute of Science & Technology (GIST)	Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.; Kim, H (corresponding author), Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Res Inst Solar & Sustainable Energies, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.; Kim, H (corresponding author), Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Inst Integrated Technol, Grad Sch Energy Convergence, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.; Lee, SH (corresponding author), Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Innovat Energy & Carbon Optimized Synth Ch, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.	heejook@gist.ac.kr; sanghan@gist.ac.kr	Lee, Sanghan/AAH-1105-2019	Lee, Sanghan/0000-0002-5807-864X; Toma, Francesca Maria/0000-0003-2332-0798	H.C. and S.S. contributed equally to this work.

Rethinking O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and breathing during wakefulness and sleep	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Review; Early Access						extra-carotid chemoreceptor O-2 sensing; obstructive sleep apnoea; peripheral-central chemoreceptor interdependence	CAROTID-BODY DENERVATION; PERIPHERAL CHEMORECEPTORS DETERMINE; VENTILATORY RESPONSE; RESPIRATORY SENSITIVITY; APNEIC THRESHOLD; HEART-FAILURE; NREM SLEEP; HYPOXIA; OXYGEN; NEURONS	We have examined the importance of three long-standing questions concerning chemoreceptor influences on cardiorespiratory function which are currently experiencing a resurgence of study among physiologists and clinical investigators. Firstly, while carotid chemoreceptors (CB) are required for hypoxic stimulation of breathing, use of an isolated, extracorporeally perfused CB preparation in unanaesthetized animals with maintained tonic input from the CB, reveals that extra-CB hypoxaemia also provides dose-dependent ventilatory stimulation sufficient to account for 40-50% of the total ventilatory response to steady-state hypoxaemia. Extra-CB hyperoxia also provides a dose- and time-dependent hyperventilation. Extra-CB sites of O-2-driven ventilatory stimulation identified to date include the medulla, kidney and spinal cord. Secondly, using the isolated or denervated CB preparation in awake animals and humans has demonstrated a hyperadditive effect of CB sensory input on central CO2 sensitivity, so that tonic CB activity accounts for as much as 35-40% of the normal, air-breathing eupnoeic drive to breathe. Thirdly, we argue for a key role for CO2 chemoreception and the neural drive to breathe in the pathogenesis of upper airway obstruction during sleep (OSA), based on the following evidence: (1) removal of the wakefulness drive to breathe enhances the effects of transient CO2 changes on breathing instability; (2) oscillations in respiratory motor output precipitate pharyngeal obstruction in sleeping subjects with compliant, collapsible airways; and (3) in the majority of patients in a large OSA cohort, a reduced neural drive to breathe accompanied reductions in both airflow and pharyngeal airway muscle dilator activity, precipitating airway obstruction. image	[Dempsey, Jerome A.] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Gibbons, Travis D.] Univ British Columbia Okanagan, Kelowna, BC, Canada	University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia Okanagan	Dempsey, JA (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA.	jdempsey@wisc.edu			The authors very much appreciate the insights provided by Barbara Morgan, Patrice Guyenet, Philip Ainslie and Erik Swenson.

A recurrent <i>KCNK4</i> variant in a dominant pedigree with hypertrichosis and gingival fibromatosis syndrome: Variable phenotypic expressivity and insights on patients&apos; dental management	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART A			English	Article; Early Access						epilepsy; gingival fibromatosis; hypertrichosis; intellectual/developmental delay; KCNK4	MUTATION; TRAAK	Abnormal hyperpolarization of the KCNK4 gene, expressed in the nervous system, brain, and periodontal ligament fibroblasts, leads to impaired neurotransmitter sensitivity, cardiac arrhythmias, and endocrine dysfunction, as well as, progressive cell proliferation. De novo gain of function variants in the KCNK4 gene were reported to cause a recognizable syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, hypertrichosis, epilepsy, intellectual/developmental delay, and gingival overgrowth (FHEIG, OMIM# 618381). FHEIG is extremely rare with only three reported cases in the literature. Herein, we describe the first inherited KCNK4 variant (c.730G>C, p.Ala244Pro) in an Egyptian boy and his mother. Variable phenotypic expressivity was noted as the patient presented with the full-blown picture of the syndrome while the mother presented only with hypertrichosis and gingival overgrowth without any neurological manifestations. The c.730G>C (p.Ala244Pro) variant was described before in a single patient and when comparing the phenotype with our patient, a phenotype-genotype correlation seems likely. Atrial fibrillation and joint laxity are new associated findings noted in our patient extending the clinical phenotype of the syndrome. Dental management was offered to the affected boy and a dramatic improvement was noted as the patient regained his smile, restored the mastication function, and resumed his psychological stability.

Meeting the parent frequently and caring for them before death were also associated with a larger share, and these effects were mostly uniform by birth order and gender.Conclusion: Patrilineal traditions continue to dominate inheritance division in contemporary Korea, with first-born sons claiming the largest share regardless of their contributions to intergenerational support. Physical contact and caregiving increase a child's likelihood of receiving a larger share, but ultimately do not change the patrilineal order in inheritance allocations.

Herein, we propose using parallel (face-to-face) conformation carbazole-bodipy donor-acceptor dyads (BCZ-1 and BCZ-2) featuring through space intramolecular charge transfer (TSCT) process as efficient triplet PS. Efficient intersystem crossing (& phi;& UDelta;=61 %) and long-lived triplet excited state (& tau;T=186 & mu;s) were observed in the TSCT dyad BCZ-1 compared to BCZ-3 (& phi;& UDelta;=0.4 %), the dyad involving TBCT, demonstrating the superiority of the TSCT approach over conventional donor-acceptor system. Moreover, the transient absorption study revealed that TSCT dyads have a faster charge separation and slower intersystem crossing process induced by charge recombination compared to TBCT dyad. A long-lived charge-separated state (CSS) was observed in the BCZ-1 (& tau;CSS=24 ns). For the first time, the TSCT dyad was explored for the triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion, and a high upconversion quantum yield of 11 % was observed. Our results demonstrate a new avenue for designing efficient PSs and open up exciting opportunities for future research in this field. Through space intramolecular charge transfer, a compact electron donor-acceptor (cabazole-bodipy) dyad with face-to-face geometry exhibits long-lived charge-separated state (& tau;CSS=24 ns) and efficient intersystem crossing (& phi;& UDelta;=61 %). This discovery opens a new avenue for designing efficient photosensitizers and photonic applications that depend on long-lived excited states generation.image	[Liang, Hui; Mahmood, Zafar; Li, Zheng; Chen, Zeduan; Chen, Guowei; Huo, Yanping; Ji, Shaomin] Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn & Light Ind, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Lu, Manlin; Li, Ming-De] Shantou Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China; [Lu, Manlin; Li, Ming-De] Shantou Univ, Key Lab Preparat & Applicat Ordered Struct Mat Gua, Shantou 515063, Peoples R China	Guangdong University of Technology; Shantou University; Shantou University	Ji, SM (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn & Light Ind, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.	smji@gdut.edu.cn	Ji, Shaomin/J-7959-2018	Ji, Shaomin/0000-0002-3304-2114; Chen, Guowei/0000-0002-4234-5205	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21975053, U2001222) and Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2022B1515020041) for financial support.

Herein, the in situ growth of hydrazone-linked covalent organic framework (COF-42) nanocrystals with a unique nanoflower-shaped morphology on 2D ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets (COF/Ti3C2Tx) is achieved through a convenient and robust stereoassembly strategy. Strikingly, the marriage of COF-42 and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets not only offers multiscale porous channels for the fast transportation of electrolyte and electrons, but also enables the full exposure and activation of numerous catalytically active centers. As a consequence, the optimized COF/Ti3C2Tx nanoarchitecture displays exceptional HER properties in terms of a very low onset potential of 19 mV, a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec-1 as well as reliable long-term durability, which are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations further disclose that the rational combination of COF-42 with Ti3C2Tx provides more diversified active positions with appropriate & UDelta;GH values, thus leading to a boosted hydrogen generation rate. The in situ growth of hydrazone-linked covalent organic framework-42 nanocrystals with a nanoflower-shaped morphology on 2D ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets is achieved via a robust stereoassembly strategy, which display exceptional electrocatalytic properties toward the hydrogen evolution reaction.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH	[Ma, Chenyu; He, Haiyan; Qin, Jinlong; Luo, Lang; Lan, Yue; Yang, Lu; Jiang, Quanguo; Huang, Huajie] Hohai Univ, Coll Mech & Mat, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jian] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun NUPT, Coll Sci, New Energy Technol Engn Lab Jiangsu Prov, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China	Hohai University; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications	He, HY; Jiang, QG; Huang, HJ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Mech & Mat, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.	he.haiyan@hhu.edu.cn; jiangqg@hhu.edu.cn; huanghuajie@hhu.edu.cn	Huang, Huajie/GLR-9597-2022	Huang, Huajie/0000-0001-5685-4994	This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 22209037) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant no.

J	Manca, F; Lewsey, J				Manca, Francesco; Lewsey, Jim			Previous psychiatric hospitalizations as risk factors for single and multiple future alcohol-related hospitalizations in patients with alcohol use disorders	ADDICTION			English	Article; Early Access						Alcohol dependence; alcohol use disorder; comorbidities; mental health; multiple failure survival analysis; observational study; Prentice Williams and Peterson model; psychiatric disorders; relapse; routine health-care data	RELAPSE	Background and aimsPeople with alcohol use disorder (AUD) often have co-occurring psychiatric conditions. The association between psychiatric conditions and AUD relapse has not yet been fully explored. This study aimed to quantify different psychiatric comorbidities as risk factors for first and multiple AUD rehospitalizations in patients already hospitalized once for AUD.MethodsWe used a nation-wide routine health-care database in Scotland, UK, between 2010 and 2019. Individuals with a first hospitalization for AUD (codes F10.0-9 in the ICD-10 codes) were checked for previous hospitalizations where the main or co-occurring cause was a psychiatric condition (any other F0-F99 code in ICD-10). The final cohort included 23 529 patients, 18 620 of whom did not have a history of any other psychiatric comorbidity. First, individuals with a history of any previous psychiatric hospitalization were grouped and compared with those without on the basis of time to AUD rehospitalization. Then, individuals with different histories of psychiatric hospitalization were compared with each other. Cox and Prentice, Williams and Peterson gap-time models were used for single and multiple AUD rehospitalizations, respectively.ResultsThe AUD rehospitalization rate in individuals with a previous psychiatric hospitalization was 8% higher compared with those without [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.14]. The difference in rehospitalization rate reduced following the first rehospitalization (HR at second rehospitalization from first: 0.95, 95% CI = 0.87-1.04 and HR at third rehospitalization from second: 0.94, 95% CI = 0.84-1.07). Mood disorders and neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders were associated with a 54% (HR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.38-1.72) and 39% (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.17-1.66) increase in the risk of a first AUD rehospitalization. Other conditions, such as disorders due to psychoactive substance use or schizophrenia, were associated with decreases in future AUD rehospitalization (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.82-0.97 and HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.58-1.16, respectively).ConclusionsPatients with AUD appear to have different rates of AUD rehospitalization based on different co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Addiction-related characteristics may be more relevant risk indicators for multiple AUD readmission than psychiatric comorbidities.

J	Nyangchak, N				Nyangchak, Niangjijia			Green growth as a pathway toward sustainable development: A systems thinking on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						circular economy; green growth; index framework; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; sustainable development; systems thinking	INDICATORS; INDUSTRY	Green growth gained traction as a global climate change strategy and pathway toward sustainable development. China's green growth has been on the rise since the turn of the century, yet it is little understood in the context of its provinces. Previous studies focus on ranking green growth across countries and regions, not on assessing individual provinces over time. This study employs systems thinking and constructs an index framework to assess the environmental, economic, and social dimensions of green growth as a pathway toward sustainable development in Qinghai on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The study finds that green growth has steadily increased between 2000 and 2021 despite a volatile growth rate. The 10th-13th Five-Year Plans showed similar trends. Short-term green growth performance fluctuated in its dimensions and pillars, while long-term performance increased steadily. Qinghai is well-positioned to achieve sustainable development and build a circular economy. The study further discusses sustainable policy implications.

To date, the dynamics of the co-creation of value from the use of personal data have been investigated from the starting point of use. However, personal data do not have inherent value, rather their value emerges during design against projected future use. We conducted a case study of the development of a personalized e-book and captured the different perceptions of the value of personal data from firm, intermediary, and customer perspectives, namely means to an end, medium of exchange, and net benefit, respectively. The diversity of perspectives highlights ontological differences in the perception of what data are, which in turn creates epistemological tensions and different expectations of the characteristics of data embedded in value co-creation. By detailing how the value of personal data is co-created in practice, we argue that co-creation during design creates conditions for sustainable data value necessary for the continuing operation of products and services based on personalization.

Here, we investigate the impact of indigenous and introduced plant assemblages associated with ethno-agricultural traditions of Tucson, AZ, on soil microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene (bacteria and archaea) and internal transcribed spacer region (fungi) metabarcoding. We found differences in soil microbial community diversity and composition across plant assemblages associated with ethno-agricultural traditions. However, we found the largest community structure differences between managed cultivated plots and not cultivated desert soils. Managed cultivated plots were characterized by higher diversity (23% increment for bacteria/archaea, and 40% for fungi) and a higher abundance of nitrifying bacteria (19% higher) and cellulolytic bacteria (39% higher) relative to minimally disturbed plots, suggesting higher rates of decomposition and nitrogen cycling. Given the observed influence of management on soil microbial communities, we conclude that efforts to build arid-specific sustainable agricultural solutions would benefit from the use of adapted plants that require minimal management. Microbial community diversity and composition were different across plant assemblages.Management of crop soils increased microbial diversity and abundance of nitrifying bacteria.Arid-specific sustainable agriculture would benefit from the use of low-input adapted plants.

J	Van Nieuwenhove, R				Van Nieuwenhove, Rik			Providence, Divine Causality, and the Gratuitousness of Love: A Thomist Perspective	NEW BLACKFRIARS			English	Article; Early Access						Thomas Aquinas; providence; divine causality; charity; afflictions		Broadly drawing on the writings of Thomas Aquinas, this article is a systematic-theological (rather than historical-theological) engagement with the theme of providence and divine causality. It aims to dispel some modern misunderstandings of these topics by highlighting how pre-modern approaches differ from today's perspective. It does so by arguing, firstly, that Thomas, given his teleological focus, construes divine causality not so much as efficient causality but rather in terms of final causality. I will also make the point that Thomas's calling God a 'universal cause' should not be construed in terms of omni-causality, as if God predetermines every event (be it necessarily or contingently). In the final part of this contribution, I make some observations on the arbitrariness of afflictions and the connection with the gratuitousness of charity within the providential ordering.

The microscopic inhomogeneities of the electronic properties of polycrystalline photovoltaic materials can be examined by these advanced AFM techniques, which bridge the local properties of materials to overall device performance and guide the optimization of the photovoltaic devices. In this review, the critical roles of local optoelectronic heterogeneities, especially at grain interiors (GIs) and grain boundaries (GBs) of polycrystalline photovoltaic materials, including versatile polycrystalline silicon, inorganic compound materials, and emerging halide perovskites, studied by KPFM and C-AFM, are systematically identified. How the band alignment and electrical properties of GIs and GBs affect the carrier transport behavior are discussed from the respective of photovoltaic research. Further exploiting the potential of such AFM-based techniques upon a summary of their up-to-date applications in polycrystalline photovoltaic materials is beneficial to acomprehensive understanding of the design and manipulation principles of thenovel solar cells and facilitating the development of the next-generation photovoltaics and optoelectronics. The critical roles of local optoelectronic heterogeneities, especially at grain interiors (GIs) and grain boundaries (GBs) of polycrystalline photovoltaic materials, including polycrystalline silicon, inorganic compound materials, and emerging halide perovskites, can be identified by the advanced atomic force microscope (AFM)-based techniques, which bridge the local properties of materials to overall device performance and guide the optimization of the photovoltaic devices.image	[Yang, Liu; Wang, Yanyan; Wang, Xu; Shafique, Shareen; Zheng, Fei; Huang, Like; Liu, Xiaohui; Zhang, Jing; Hu, Ziyang] Ningbo Univ, Dept Microelect Sci & Engn, Lab Clean Energy Storage & Convers, Sch Phys Sci & Technol,Ningbo Collaborat Innovat C, Ningbo 315211, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanyan] Fudan Univ, Ctr Micronano Syst, Sch Informat Sci & Technol SIST, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Yuejin] Ningbo Univ, Sch Sci & Engn, Coll Sci & Technol, Ningbo 315300, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Chuanxiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Ningbo Inst Mat Technol & Engn NIMTE, Ningbo 315201, Zhejiang, Peoples R China	Ningbo University; Fudan University; Ningbo University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, CAS	Zheng, F; Hu, ZY (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Dept Microelect Sci & Engn, Lab Clean Energy Storage & Convers, Sch Phys Sci & Technol,Ningbo Collaborat Innovat C, Ningbo 315211, Peoples R China.	zhengfei@nbu.edu.cn; huziyang@nbu.edu.cn			This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62074088 and 62174094), the Foundation of Zhejiang Educational Commission (Grant No. Y201737090), the Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo City (Grant No. 2017A610018), [62074088, 62174094]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [Y201737090]; Foundation of Zhejiang Educational Commission [2017A610018]; Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo City [2018B10055]; Ningbo Samp;amp;T Innovation 2025 Major Special Programme; K.C.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for novel treatment strategies for CRPC. Polyphyllin I (PPI), one of the steroidal saponins in paris polyphylla, has been shown to have an anticancer effect. This study investigated the role and mechanism of PPI in CRPC cell ferroptosis.MethodsProtein levels of GPX4, p-extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), ERK, DNMT1, and ACSL4 were measured by Western blot. DNMT1 and ACSL4 mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Prostate cancer cells (DU145, PC3) were treated with PPI. Cell viability was assessed utilizing Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The role of PPI in regulating ferroptosis was determined by analyzing lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), malonyl dialdehyde (MDA), iron (Fe2+), and glutathione (GSH) content. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay verified the effect of DNMT1 on the ACSL4 promoter. The methylation level of ACSL4 promoter was assessed utilizing MSP. A nude mice xenograft was adopted to detect the effect of PPI in vivo.ResultsPPI inhibited CRPC cell proliferation, reduced levels of GSH and GPX4, and increased levels of MDA, Fe2+, and ROS, while ERK inhibitor reversed the effect of PPI on ferroptosis. PPI repressed the methylation level of ACSL4 promoter by inhibiting DNMT1. DNMT1 knockdown promoted CRPC cell ferroptosis by regulating ACSL4. PPI induced ferroptosis and suppressed CRPC growth in nude mice.ConclusionPPI can be used as a ferroptosis inducer to induce ferroptosis in CRPC cells via the ERK/DNMT1/ACSL4 axis, suggesting that PPI may be a new strategy for CRPC treatment.

However, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on BTA-containing polymers is restricted to 15-16%, lagging other promising polymers. Thus, investigating the structure-performance relationship and breaking the efficiency bottleneck of BTA-based polymers is challenging but critical. Herein, the effects of fusing two thiophene rings at D (PE52), & pi; (PE4), and A (PE39) units of a classic D-& pi;-A-type BTA-containing polymer J52-Cl, respectively, on the backbone conformation, crystallinity, molecular stacking, and photovoltaic performance are systematically investigated. When blended with a BTA-containing non-fullerene acceptor (NFA), Y18, all three polymers with extending conjugated backbones can decrease the energy loss of photovoltaic devices. Notably, PE4, with a linear backbone conformation, realizes the champion PCE of 17.08%, with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.83 mA cm-2, a large breakthrough for BTA-based photovoltaic polymers. What's more, the photovoltaic device based on PE4:Y18 combination fabricated by a non-halogenated solvent of o-xylene also displays an excellent PCE of 16.87%. The results indicate that fusing thiophene rings to BTA-polymers, especially at & pi;-bridge, is a simple and effective method to improve the photovoltaic performance via modulating the molecular conformation and crystallinity. Thiophene rings are fused on the donor (D), & pi;, and acceptor (A) units, respectively, to extend the conjugation length and fine-tune molecular conformation of the classic D-& pi;-A-type benzotriazole (BTA)-containing polymer. Thiophene fusion on the & pi;-bridge produces the linear backbone and the highest carrier mobilities, contributing to a champion power conversion efficiency above 17%, a breakthrough for BTA-based photovoltaic polymers.image	[Du, Mengzhen; Yu, Jiagui; Wang, Zongtao; Guo, Qiang; Zhou, Erjun] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Du, Mengzhen; Tang, Ailing; Yu, Jiagui; Geng, Yanfang; Wang, Zongtao; Zhou, Erjun] Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Yufei] NingboTech Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China; [Lu, Shirong] Taizhou Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Technol, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China	Zhengzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Center for Nanoscience & Technology - China; NingboTech University; Taizhou University	Zhou, ER (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.; Zhou, ER (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Nanosci & Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.	zhouej@nanoctr.cn		Zhou, Erjun/0000-0003-1182-311X	The authors thank the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, Nos. 52073067, 22109142).

However, little is known about how the average level of identification in the group - 'the identification environment' - buffers the negative health consequences of stressors. We used multilevel modelling to investigate whether identification environment in a school modified the association between the students' perceptions of the quality of their school's physical environment and their reported levels of anxiety. In two representative samples of Finnish school students (N = 678 schools/71,392 students; N = 704 schools/85,989 students), weak identification environment was related to increased anxiety. In addition, in schools where identification environment was weaker, the student level relationship between perceived physical environment and anxiety was stronger, and students were more anxious. Our results provide evidence that identification environment needs to be considered when we analyse how group membership affects well-being.

This study aimed to provide insights into the menstrual patterns among medical faculty students and determine whether stress can be a risk factor for its various disorders.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in the Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy at the Syrian Private University, Damascus, Syria, between October and November 2022. A total of 980 female students anonymously completed the identification of menstrual problems and the perceived stress scale (PSS) questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS-25.ResultsThe mean age of students was 21.52 & PLUSMN; 2.06 years. The most common menstrual disorders in this study were dysmenorrhea (88%), and premenstrual syndrome (87%). A total of 82% had mild to moderate stress, 10% had high stress, and 8% had low stress. Moderate to high perceived stress was associated with an increased risk of PMS (OR = 1.79, P = 0.0037).ConclusionThese findings stress the importance of universities, especially health science faculties, establishing protocols for early detection and intervention in students with stress and menstrual disorders. Implementing stress reduction education and timely counseling, along with preventive measures, is crucial for students' well-being. Further research is needed to refine interventions for this group. Moderate to high perceived stress was associated with an increased risk of PMS (OR = 1.79, P = 0.0037), 88% had dysmenorrhea, and 87% had PMS.

The Pure-AI (no human intervention) and ground truth (GT, full human intervention) data groups were compared.ResultsIn the Pure-AI group, the median Dice coefficients of the right and left hemilivers were highly similar, 0.95 and 0.92, respectively; sectors, posterior to lateral: 0.86-0.92, and Couinaud's segments 1-8: 0.71-0.89. Labeling of the first-order branch as hemiliver, right or left portal vein perfectly matched; 92.8% of the second-order (sectors); 91.6% of third-order (segments) matched between the Pure-AI and GT data.ConclusionsThe two-step AI algorithm for liver segmentation automates anatomic virtual hepatectomy. The AI-based algorithm correctly divided all hemilivers, and more than 90% of the sectors and segments.

DC Arc Quenching Using Ablation of Polymer Narrow-Section Arranged around Fuse Element	IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						fuse; DC arc; DC interruption; polymer		This paper was arranged a polymer cylinder around a Cu fuse-element to increase both an arc resistance rarc$$ {r}_{\mathrm{arc}} $$ during a DC arc quenching process and an insulation resistance Rins$$ {R}_{\mathrm{ins}} $$ after the DC arc quenching. The used polymer cylinder equips a narrow-section with a width wP$$ {w}_{\mathrm{P}} $$ made from the polymer. A position of the narrow-section was around an arc-ignition point of the Cu fuse-element. Silica-sand (SiO2-sand) was filled inside the polymer cylinder. Then, a damping DC with a prospective peak of 1000 A was energized to the Cu fuse-element. As an experimental result, rarc$$ {r}_{\mathrm{arc}} $$ was successfully increased with wP$$ {w}_{\mathrm{P}} $$ of the narrow-section. In addition, the rise in wP$$ {w}_{\mathrm{P}} $$ of the narrow-section also increased Rins$$ {R}_{\mathrm{ins}} $$ to more than 10 M & omega;$$ \mathrm{M}\Omega $$ under the DC 1000 V application after the arc quenching. In order to interpret rarc$$ {r}_{\mathrm{arc}} $$ rise and high Rins$$ {R}_{\mathrm{ins}} $$ under the polymer cylinder arrangement, chemical composition, an electrical resistivity & rho;$$ \rho $$, and a thermal diffusivity & alpha;$$ \alpha $$ of Cu/SiO2/Polymer vapor mixture was also calculated. Based on the experimental result and calculation result, rarc$$ {r}_{\mathrm{arc}} $$ rise can be interpreted based on rise in & rho;$$ \rho $$ and & alpha;$$ \alpha $$ due to the polymer vapor admixing into Cu/SiO2 vapor mixture. In addition, increasing Rins$$ {R}_{\mathrm{ins}} $$ can also be interpreted by the polymer ablation of the narrow-section of the cylinder. The results are useful to further increase the interruption capacity of the DC fuse. & COPY; 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineer of Japan and Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The objective of this study was to use normalised size spectra (NSS) to investigate whether small-scale spatial variation in predation risk (by fish) can modulate zooplankton community structure at the within-lake level in a small temperate lake.We tested the difference in the NSS between two hydrologically well-connected basins of a lake exhibiting contrasting thermal regimes. The first is a well-mixed shallow basin (max. depth 2.5 m) that is inaccessible to brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) during summer because the temperature is too warm. The second is a deeper basin (max. depth 18 m) offering a thermal refuge during summer because of lake stratification. As a consequence of these differences in fish accessibility, the fishless basin should contain larger and more abundant zooplankters, inducing a change in NSS slope and height.Our results showed that both the zooplankton size structure and taxonomic composition were distinct in the two basins, with a higher proportion of small individuals and a higher abundance of zooplankton in the shallow basin compared to the deep one. Furthermore, following cooling of the epilimnion in late summer, the zooplankton communities of both basins exhibited a clear shift in size structure and species composition: in autumn, there were smaller individuals and larger proportions of Bosminidae and Daphniidae compared to colonial rotifers than in summer. These results suggest a potential effect of the change in the spatial distribution of brook charr which feed preferentially on large individuals, reducing the average body size of the zooplankton community.Our results show that predation risk by fish can induce a spatial and temporal variation in zooplankton community structure within small temperate lake ecosystems exhibiting contrasted thermal regimes. Other potential predators also influenced the zooplankton community structure, creating a complex interplay that has to be taken into account to disentangle ecological processes and predict their future changes.

However, the phenomenon has recently been severely challenged by a wave of deglobalization. Within this new trend, the conflict between the United States (US) and China has attracted the attention of scholars from various fields because of the two countries' significance in the world economy. In this study, we focus on the higher education sector, which is highly relevant to globalization, and explore the factors that may affect Chinese college students' attitudes towards US universities, including country image, cultural openness, consumer animosity and perceived quality. In particular, we distinguish between cognitive and affective animosity and test their different impacts on students' attitudes. The results show that students' perception of the US's image positively influences attitudes towards the country's universities thanks to the mediation of perceived quality. Moreover, cultural openness and cognitive animosity are positively related to attitudes, whereas affective animosity exerts a negative impact on attitudes. The implications and limitations of this study are also discussed.

In this work, development steps taken to include carbon ions in MonteRay are presented. Dose distributions computed with MonteRay are evaluated using a comprehensive validation dataset, including various measurements (pristine Bragg peaks, spread out Bragg peaks in water and behind an anthropomorphic phantom) and simulations of a patient plan. The latter includes both physical and biological dose comparisons. Runtimes of MonteRay were evaluated against those of FLUKA MC on a standard benchmark problem.ResultsDosimetric comparisons between MonteRay and measurements demonstrated good agreement. In terms of pristine Bragg peaks, mean errors between simulated and measured integral depth dose distributions were between -2.3% and +2.7%. Comparing SOBPs at 5, 12.5 and 20 cm depth, mean absolute relative dose differences were 0.9%, 0.7% and 1.6% respectively. Comparison against measurements behind an anthropomorphic head phantom revealed mean absolute dose differences of 1.2%& PLUSMN;1.1%$1.2\% \pm 1.1\;\% \;$with global 3%/3 mm 3D-& gamma; passing rates of 99.3%, comparable to those previously reached with FLUKA (98.9%). Comparisons against dose predictions computed with the clinical treatment planning tool RayStation 11B for a meningioma patient plan revealed excellent local 1%/1 mm 3D-& gamma; passing rates of 98% for physical and 94% for biological dose. In terms of runtime, MonteRay achieved speedups against reference FLUKA simulations ranging from 14x to 72x, depending on the beam's energy and the step size chosen.ConclusionsValidations against clinical dosimetric measurements in homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios and clinical TPS calculations have proven the validity of the physical models implemented in MonteRay. To conclude, MonteRay is viable as a fast secondary MC engine for supporting clinical practice in proton, helium and carbon ion radiotherapy.

Temperate, semi-natural grasslands emerged from traditional land use and are recognised for their outstanding biodiversity. However, these grasslands severely declined due to agricultural industrialisation. Accordingly, specialised species of nutrient-poor grasslands like the closely related butterflies Nickerls Fritillary Melitaea aurelia Nickerl, 1850 and Marsh Fritillary Euphydyras aurinia (Rottemburg, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) have experienced strong declines in the last century due to grassland loss and deterioration. Here, we studied for the first time the effects of the complete harvest process in grasslands from mowing until the removal of the cut vegetation on the survival of their caterpillars. 2. To assess survival rates, we sampled larvae of both species and environmental conditions before and after the harvest process and analysed the results using generalised linear mixed-effects models. 3. Our study revealed that the harvest process in grasslands mown once by bar mowers resulted in substantial caterpillar loss influenced by (i) growth form of the host plants and (ii) timing of grassland harvest. Accordingly, the host plant of E. aurinia, Succisa prantensis, lost nearly half of its leaves during the harvest process, while late harvesting was especially harmful for caterpillars already commencing hibernation. Overall, E. aurinia had higher losses compared with M. aurelia, and these were most severe in late-mown moist meadows. 4. To increase the survival rate of E. aurinia, we recommend mowing before the beginning of hibernation using bar mowers. Complementary, or if mowing is done later, at least 20% of the meadow should be left as an untouched refuge in a spatially rotating manner.

It is characterized by high resolution, high precision, and high speed, applied to various materials, including metals, ceramics, and organic materials. Compared with traditional printing technologies, EHD printing offers advantages such as low manufacturing cost, simple process, and direct fabrication, making it highly promising in the field of micro-nano manufacturing. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) is a highly water-soluble polymer that has been widely used in various fields due to its low toxicity and ease of processing. In this study, a finite element simulation model was developed using simulation software to simulate and analyze the mechanisms of focused jetting and deposition of PEO solution under an electric field. Based on the principles of electrohydrodynamics, a self-built EHD printing system was used to investigate the influence of different solution mass fractions and printing parameters on fiber formation, and the optimal process window of EHD printing PEO solution was obtained. Ultimately, ordered deposition of fiber lines ranging from 1.761 to 6.093 & mu;m was achieved. The simulation results were consistent with the experimental results, validating the effectiveness of the established model in guiding jetting outcomes.HighlightsIndependently building a low-cost electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing system.Finite element simulation of EHD printing process.Mechanism analysis of PEO solution jetting and deposition.Optimal process window for PEO solution EHD printing.Influence of key process parameters on fiber forming width.

Hence, this study clarified the action of TUDCA on DPN development and explored its mechanism of action. Fecal samples were collected from 50 patients with T2DM or DPN. Schwann cells induced by high levels were constructed to simulate an uncontrolled diabetic state. Cell viability and migration were measured using the CCK-8 and wound-healing assays, respectively. Reactive oxygen species and pyroptosis were detected using flow cytometry. Parabacteroides goldsteinii and Parabacteroides distasonis levels were decreased in the feces of patients with DPN. TUDCA enhanced the viability and migration ability of high glucose-stimulated Schwann cells. In addition, Schwann cell pyroptosis stimulated by high glucose levels was inhibited by TUDCA. Furthermore, the protective roles of TUDCA in cell viability, migration ability, and pyroptosis of Schwann cells stimulated by high glucose were suppressed by the overexpression of NLRP3. TUDCA enhanced cell viability and migration and suppressed pyroptosis in Schwann cells stimulated by high glucose levels by modulating NLRP3 expression. Thus, TUDCA may be a promising drug for DPN therapy.

The coordination of Li cations with carbonyl groups significantly reduced the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and improved the mechanical properties. Moreover, by adjusting the ratio of CBDA and TPC, all PAI films exhibited high glass transition temperature (T-g), low CTE and high transparency. Among these PAI films, PAI-6-2Li exhibited excellent comprehensive performance with a high T(g )of 363 degrees C, low CTE of 6.4 ppm/K, high transmittance of 84% at 400 nm and tensile modulus of 7.2 GPa, which was expected to be used in the field of flexible displays.

Through this process, a coach can identify habits, tendencies and behaviours that may be causing distraction or make them less productive. This insight can be used to make changes in behaviour and establish new habits that promote effective use of time. This can also help the coach to prioritise goals and create a clear roadmap. An AI powered system has been proposed that maps the conversion onto topics and relations that could help the coach with note-taking and progress identification throughout the session. This system enables the coach to actively self-reflect on time management and make sure the conversation follows the target framework. This will help the coach to better understand the goal setting, breakthrough moment, and client accountability. The proposed end-to-end system is capable of identifying coaching segments (Goal, Option, Reality, and Way forward) across a session with 85% accuracy. Experimental evaluation has also been conducted on the coaching dataset which includes over 1k one-to-one English coaching sessions. In regards to the novelty, there are no datasets of such nor study of this kind to enable self-reflection actively and evaluate in-session performance of the coach.

A novel approach of attachment combining two fluorescent dyes on the copolymer precursor and its conjugation to antibody is employed to synthesize barcoded nanoprobes of antibody polymer dyes allowing up to six nanoprobes to be resolved in two-dimensional cytometry analysis. The major advantage of these nanoprobes is the construct design in which the selected antibody is labeled with an advanced copolymer bearing two types of fluorophores in different molar ratios. The cells after antibody recognition and binding to the target antigen have a characteristic double fluorescence signal for each nanoprobe providing a unique position on the dot plot, thus allowing antibody-based barcoding of cellular samples in flow cytometry assays. This technique is valuable for cellular assays that require low intersample variability and is demonstrated by the live cell barcoding of clinical samples with B cell abnormalities. In total, the samples from six various donors were successfully barcoded using only two detection channels. This barcoding of clinical samples enables sample preparation and measurement in a single tube. An advanced bioconjugation technique of hybrid polymer-antibody nanoprobes tailored for fluorescent cell barcoding in flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping of leukocytes is developed. The approach based on attachment of two fluorescent dyes on the copolymer precursor and its conjugation to antibody is employed to synthesize barcoded nanoprobes of antibody polymer dyes allowing up to six nanoprobes to be resolved in two-dimensional cytometry analysis.image	[Kudlacova, Julia; Kostka, Libor; Etrych, Tomasc] Inst Macromol Chem CAS, Dept Biomed Polymers, Heyrovskeho Nam 2, Prague 16200, Czech Republic; [Kuzilkova, Daniela; Brdickova, Nadezda; Vavrova, Adela; Kalina, Tomasc] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 2, Dept Paediat Haematol & Oncol, CLIP Childhood Leukemia Invest Prague, V Uvalu 84, Prague 15006, Czech Republic; [Kuzilkova, Daniela; Brdickova, Nadezda; Vavrova, Adela; Kalina, Tomasc] Univ Hosp Motol, V Uvalu 84, Prague 15006, Czech Republic; [Barta, Frantisek; Hovorka, Ondrej] ITA Intertact Sro, R&D Div, Cernokostelecka 143, Prague 10800, Czech Republic	Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Motol University Hospital	Etrych, T (corresponding author), Inst Macromol Chem CAS, Dept Biomed Polymers, Heyrovskeho Nam 2, Prague 16200, Czech Republic.	etrych@imc.cas.cz	Kostka, Libor/H-4182-2014	Kostka, Libor/0000-0002-7770-1855	J.K., D.K., T.K., and T.E. contributed equally to this work.

The performance of LS highly depends on the neighborhood exploration of solutions. Many methods have been developed over the years to improve the efficiency of LS on different problems of operations research. In particular, the exploration strategy of the neighborhood and the exclusion of irrelevant neighboring solutions are design mechanisms that have to be carefully considered when tackling NP-hard optimization problems. An MOEA/D framework including an LS-based mutation and knowledge discovery mechanisms is the core algorithm used to solve a bi-objective vehicle routing problem with time windows (bVRPTW) where the total traveling cost and the total waiting time of drivers have to be minimized. We enhance the classical LS exploration strategy of the neighborhood from the literature of scheduling and propose new metrics based on customer distances and waiting times to reduce the neighborhood size. We conduct a deep analysis of the parameters to give a fine tuning of the MOEA/D framework adapted to the LS variants and to the bVRPTW. Experiments show that the proposed neighborhood strategies lead to better performance on both Solomon's and Gehring and Homberger's benchmarks.

However, manual ROI delineations are labor-intensive and susceptible to inter-reader variability. Histopathology images from radical prostatectomy (RP) represent the "gold standard" in terms of the delineation of disease extents, for example, PCa, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Co-registering digitized histopathology images onto pre-operative mpMRI enables automated mapping of the ground truth disease extents onto mpMRI, thus enabling the development of machine learning tools for PCa detection and risk stratification. Still, MRI-histopathology co-registration is challenging due to various artifacts and large deformation between in vivo MRI and ex vivo whole-mount histopathology images (WMHs). Furthermore, the artifacts on WMHs, such as tissue loss, may introduce unrealistic deformation during co-registration.Purpose: This study presents a new registration pipeline, MSERgSDM, a multi-scale feature-based registration (MSERg) with a statistical deformation (SDM) constraint, which aims to improve accuracy of MRI-histopathology co-registration.Methods: In this study, we collected 85 pairs of MRI and WMHs from 48 patients across three cohorts. Cohort 1 (D1), comprised of a unique set of 3D printed mold data from six patients, facilitated the generation of ground truth deformations between ex vivo WMHs and in vivo MRI. The other two clinically acquired cohorts (D2 and D3) included 42 patients. Affine and nonrigid registrations were employed to minimize the deformation between ex vivo WMH and ex vivo T2-weighted MRI (T2WI) in D1. Subsequently, ground truth deformation between in vivo T2WI and ex vivo WMH was approximated as the deformation between in vivo T2WI and ex vivo T2WI. In D2 and D3, the prostate anatomical annotations, for example, tumor and urethra, were made by a pathologist and a radiologist in collaboration. These annotations included ROI boundary contours and landmark points. Before applying the registration, manual corrections were made for flipping and rotation of WMHs. MSERgSDM comprises two main components: (1) multi-scale representation construction, and (2) SDM construction. For the SDM construction, we collected N = 200 reasonable deformation fields generated using MSERg, verified through visual inspection. Three additional methods, including intensity-based registration, ProsRegNet, and MSERg, were also employed for comparison against MSERgSDM.Results: Our results suggest that MSERgSDM performed comparably to the ground truth (p > 0.05). Additionally, MSERgSDM (ROI Dice ratio = 0.61, landmark distance = 3.26 mm) exhibited significant improvement over MSERg (ROI Dice ratio = 0.59, landmark distance = 3.69 mm) and ProsRegNet (ROI Dice ratio = 0.56, landmark distance = 4.00 mm) in local alignment.Conclusions: This study presents a novel registration method, MSERgSDM, for mapping ex vivo WMH onto in vivo prostate MRI. Our preliminary results demonstrate that MSERgSDM can serve as a valuable tool to map ground truth disease annotations from histopathology images onto MRI, thereby assisting in the development of machine learning models for PCa detection on MRI.

J	Manna, S; Singh, DK; Akella, AK				Manna, Saibal; Singh, Deepak Kumar; Akella, Ashok Kumar			Hybrid two-stage adaptive maximum power point tracking for stand-alone, grid integration, and partial shaded PV system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article; Early Access						grid-integration; maximum power point tracking; modified MRAC; MPPT failure; partial shading; solar PV	MPPT TECHNIQUES; INTELLIGENT; CONTROLLER	In a PV array, the power-voltage characteristic (P-V) and output power are completely dependent on atmospheric conditions. Consequently, the P-V curve's maximum power point (MPP) likewise changes significantly. This abrupt oscillation in the MPP may be caused by the PV panel being uniformly or partially shaded by trees, buildings, raindrops, and clouds. However, in both circumstances, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) turns into a highly nonlinear issue with a time-bounded solution. The unpredictable weather circumstances change P-V characteristics after every short time interval. Therefore, this research presents a hybrid two-stage adaptive MPPT to overcome the environmental uncertainties. The first stage is MPPT control block for determining reference voltage for each MPP and the second stage is modified model reference adaptive controller (MMRAC) block fine-tunes converter duty cycle to maintain MPP of PV panel. The probabilistic evaluation is executed through four distinct levels of uncertainty, including stand-alone, partially-shaded, grid integration, and OPAL-RT to examine the system robustness in diverse scenario. The possibility of the tracking failure caused by dynamic irradiance change is also verified. Moreover, efficiency, tracking ability, power loss, ripple, and error rate are compared with the state-of-the-art strategies, that is, ANFIS, INC, P & O, and VSPO. The satisfactory performances of the new strategy under simultaneously varying irradiance, temperature, and load; partially shaded and grid integration shows the supremacy.

Experimentally, it is found that a proper battery design utilizing the reactions can lead to a dynamic evolution from interface instability to stability, giving the so-called dynamic voltage stability for advanced battery performance. Here, first the state-of-the-art understanding is articulated about how the dynamic voltage stability should be interpreted in physical picture and treated in computation, emphasizing the potential importance of nonequilibrium reaction pathways. The constrained ensemble computational approach is further applied across most types of solid-state electrolytes to systematically evaluate and compare their dynamic stability voltage windows in response to the mechanical constriction effect. High-throughput calculations are used to search for coating materials for different interfaces between sulfide, halide, and oxide electrolytes and typical cathode materials with enhanced dynamic voltage stability. A comparison with experiment is given to highlight the value of these computational predictions. Dynamic voltage stability of solid-state battery interfaces widens the voltage stability window. It includes thermodynamic stability and a large portion of kinetic stability. The constrained ensemble computational approach is applied across most types of solid-state electrolytes to systematically evaluate and compare their dynamic stability voltage windows in response to the mechanical constriction effect and predict coating materials.image	[Wang, Yichao; Ye, Luhan; Fitzhugh, William; Chen, Xi; Li, Xin] Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA	Harvard University	Li, X (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.	lixin@seas.harvard.edu			This work is partially supported by Data Science Initiative Competitive Research Award at Harvard University, and partially supported by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) of the U.S.; Data Science Initiative Competitive Research Award at Harvard University; Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); Nissan North America; National Science Foundation Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) Stampede and Frontera supercomputers	This work is partially supported by Data Science Initiative Competitive Research Award at Harvard University, and partially supported by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) of the U.S.; Data Science Initiative Competitive Research Award at Harvard University; Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Nissan North America; National Science Foundation Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) Stampede and Frontera supercomputers	This work is partially supported by Data Science Initiative Competitive Research Award at Harvard University, and partially supported by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Vehicle Technology Office (VTO) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and Nissan North America.

J	Yeganeh, RR; Ayoubi, M				Yeganeh, Radman Rahimi; Ayoubi, Mona			Designing two mixed quick switching sampling plans for linear profiles	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						attribute sampling plan; consumer's risk; linear profiles; producer's risk; quick switching sampling (QSS); variable sampling plan	YIELD INDEX; ECONOMIC DESIGN; SYSTEM; CONSTRUCTION; AUTOCORRELATION; SELECTION; SIZE	This study compares two proposed mixed quick switching sampling (QSS) plans for linear profiles as the quality characteristic. For the QSS plans, we recommend a binomial attribute plan for normal inspection and then a variable sampling plan for tightened inspection based on capability index C-puA of linear profiles with one-sided specifications. The difference between the two proposed QSS plans is in the tightened inspection. Tightened inspection of the first proposed plan is a single sampling using C-puA index, but tightened inspection of the second plan is a multiple dependent state repetitive (MDSR) plan based on C-puA index. The optimal parameters are obtained by nonlinear optimization. Simulation study for selecting parameters is conducted with various combinations of specified acceptable quality level (AQL), limited quality level (LQL), producer's risk, and consumer's risk. Simulation results confirm that the second proposed QSS plan which applies variable MDSR at tightened inspection performs better than another proposed plan. Hence, the approach of the second proposed plan is demonstrated in an illustrative example.

Some breaks down into microplastics (MPs) that can enter and distribute in living organisms causing effects in multiple target organs. MPs have been demonstrated to harm animals through environmental exposure. Laboratory animal studies are still insufficient to evaluate human impact. And while MPs have been found in human tissues, the health effects at environmental exposure levels are unclear.AimWe reviewed and summarized existing evidence on health effects from occupational exposure to MPs. Additionally, the diverse effects documented for workers were organized by MP type and associated co-contaminants. Evidence of the unique effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on liver was then highlighted.MethodsWe conducted two stepwise online literature reviews of publications focused on the health risks associated with occupational MP exposures. This information was supplemented with findings from animal studies.ResultsOur analysis focused on 34 published studies on occupational health effects from MP exposure with half involving exposure to PVC and the other half a variety of other MPs to compare. Liver effects following PVC exposure were reported for workers. While PVC exposure causes liver toxicity and increases the risk of liver cancers, including angiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas, the carcinogenic effects of work-related exposure to other MPs, such as polystyrene and polyethylene, are not well understood.ConclusionThe data supporting liver toxicity are strongest for PVC exposure. Overall, the evidence of liver toxicity from occupational exposure to MPs other than PVC is lacking. The PVC worker data summarized here can be useful in assisting clinicians evaluating exposure histories from PVC exposure and designing future cell, animal, and population exposure-effect research studies.

Given the current rates of climate change, with associated shifts in herbivore population densities, understanding the role of different herbivores in ecosystem functioning is critical for predicting ecosystem responses. Here, we examined how migratory geese and resident, non-migratory reindeer-two dominating yet functionally contrasting herbivores-control vegetation and ecosystem processes in rapidly warming Arctic tundra. 2. We collected vegetation and ecosystem carbon (C) flux data at peak plant growing season in the two longest running, fully replicated herbivore removal experiments found in high-Arctic Svalbard. Experiments had been set up independently in wet habitat utilised by barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in summer and in moist-to-dry habitat utilised by wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus year-round. 3. Excluding geese induced vegetation state transitions from heavily grazed, moss-dominated (only 4 g m(-2) of live above-ground vascular plant biomass) to ungrazed, graminoid-dominated (60 g m(-2) after 4-year exclusion) and horsetail-dominated (150 g m(-2) after 15-year exclusion) tundra. This caused large increases in vegetation C and nitrogen (N) pools, dead biomass and moss-layer depth. Alterations in plant N concentration and CN ratio suggest overall slower plant community nutrient dynamics in the short-term (4-year) absence of geese. Long-term (15-year) goose removal quadrupled net ecosystem C sequestration (NEE) by increasing ecosystem photosynthesis more than ecosystem respiration (ER). 4. Excluding reindeer for 21 years also produced detectable increases in live above-ground vascular plant biomass (from 50 to 80 g m(-2); without promoting vegetation state shifts), as well as in vegetation C and N pools, dead biomass, moss-layer depth and ER. Yet, reindeer removal did not alter the chemistry of plants and soil or NEE. 5. Synthesis. Although both herbivores were key drivers of ecosystem structure and function, the control exerted by geese in their main habitat (wet tundra) was much more pronounced than that exerted by reindeer in their main habitat (moist-to-dry tundra). Importantly, these herbivore effects are scale dependent, because geese are more spatially concentrated and thereby affect a smaller portion of the tundra landscape compared to reindeer. Our results highlight the substantial heterogeneity in how herbivores shape tundra vegetation and ecosystem processes, with implications for ongoing environmental change.

Moreover, the rapid growth and technological advancements in wearable optoelectronics have promoted the development of flexible organic photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensor systems that can be implanted directly onto the human body without any additional interface for efficient bio-signal monitoring. As an example, the pulse oximeter utilizes PPG signals to monitor the oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in the blood volume using two distinct wavelengths with organic light emitting diode (OLED) as light source and an organic photodiode (OPD) as light sensor. Utilizing the flexible and soft properties of organic semiconductors, pulse oximeter can be both flexible and conformal when fabricated on thin polymeric substrates. It can also provide highly efficient human-machine interface systems that can allow for long-time biological integration and flawless measurement of signal data. In this work, a clear and systematic overview of the latest progress and updates in flexible and wearable all-organic pulse oximetry sensors for SpO(2) monitoring, including design and geometry, processing techniques and materials, encapsulation of various factors affecting the device performance, and limitations are provided. Finally, some of the research challenges and future opportunities in the field are mentioned.

In this paper, we propose that the influence of resting time on the rheological properties is closely related to size variation of non-absorbed PCE. To identify this, glass bead suspensions were prepared with various amounts of PCE and ionic solution, and their rheological properties were evaluated at various times. We found that the yield stress increases with time at higher PCE concentrations and higher ionic strength solutions. Adsorbed PCE during resting tends to bridge the particles rather than disperse them. In addition, it was found that hydrodynamic radius of PCE increased with resting time, and depletion forces resulting from non-absorbed PCE size changes correlate well with the increased yield stress.

Several meta-analyses and numerous case-control studies have indicated that this population experiences a moderate degree of impairment, with a small percentage of studies failing to detect any impairment. One possible account of this mixed pattern of findings is heterogeneity in face processing abilities stemming from the presence of a subpopulation of prosopagnosic individuals with ASD alongside those with normal face processing skills. Samples randomly drawn from such a population, especially relatively smaller ones, would vary in the proportion of participants with prosopagnosia, resulting in a wide range of group-level deficits from mild (or none) to severe across studies. We test this prosopagnosic subpopulation hypothesis by examining three groups of participants: adults with ASD, adults with developmental prosopagnosia (DP), and a comparison group. Our results show that the prosopagnosic subpopulation hypothesis does not account for the face impairments in the broader autism spectrum. ASD observers show a continuous and graded, rather than categorical, heterogeneity that span a range of face processing skills including many with mild to moderate deficits, inconsistent with a prosopagnosic subtype account. We suggest that pathogenic origins of face deficits for at least some with ASD differ from those of DP. Face recognition challenges are well-documented in autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the origin of such difficulties remains a topic of debate. Recently, it has been suggested that face identification difficulties in ASD may share the same cause as those with developmental prosopagnosia (DP), potentially defining a prosopagnosic subgroup within ASD. We show that although about one third of those on the spectrum experience severity comparable to DP, overall face ability spans from severe to mild continuously with no indication of a distinct sub-group. These results do not lend support to a prosopagnosic subtype hypothesis of autism.

We examined the albedo of six bioenergy cropping systems in southwest Michigan USA: monocultures of energy sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), and giant miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), and polycultures of native grasses, early successional vegetation, and restored prairie. Direct field measurements of surface albedo (alpha(s)) from May 2018 through December 2020 at half-hourly intervals in each system quantified the magnitudes and seasonal differences in albedo (Delta(alpha)) and albedo-induced radiative forcing (RF Delta alpha). We used a nearby forest as a historical native cover type to estimate reference albedo and RF(Delta alpha)change upon original land use conversion, and a continuous no-till maize (Zea mays L.) system as a contemporary reference to estimate change upon conversion from annual row crops. Annually, as differed significantly (p < 0.05) among crops in the order: early successional (0.288 +/- 0.012SE) >> miscanthus (0.271 +/- 0.009) approximate to energy sorghum (0.270 +/- 0.010) = switchgrass (0.265 +/- 0.009) approximate to restored prairie (0.264 +/- 0.012) > native grasses (0.259 +/- 0.010) > maize (0.247 +/- 0.010). Reference forest had the lowest annual as (0.134 +/- 0.003). Albedo differences among crops during the growing season were also statistically significant, with growing season as in perennial crops and energy sorghum on average similar to 20% higher (0.206 +/- 0.003) than in no-till maize (0.184 +/- 0.002). Average non-growing season (NGS) as (0.370 +/- 0.020) was much higher than growing season as (0.203 +/- 0.003) but these NGS differences were not significant. Overall, the original conversion of reference forest and maize landscapes to perennials provided a cooling effect on the local climate (RFaMAIZE: -3.83 +/- 1.00 W m(-2); RF alpha FOREST: -16.75 +/- 3.01 W m(-2)). Significant differences among cropping systems suggest an additional management intervention for maximizing the positive climate benefit of bioenergy crops, with cellulosic crops on average similar to 9.1% more reflective than no-till maize, which itself was about twice as reflective as the reference forest.

Economic evaluation of prostate cancer risk assessment methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis using population data	CANCER MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						economic evaluation; health administrative data; prostate cancer; screening	SYSTEMATIC TRANSRECTAL ULTRASOUND; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; HEALTH INDEX; ANTIGEN; BIOPSY; MEN; PSA; OVERDIAGNOSIS; STRATEGIES; BIOMARKERS	BackgroundThe current prostate cancer (PCa) screening standard of care (SOC) leads to unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment because decisions are guided by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, which have low specificity in the gray zone (3-10 ng/mL). New risk assessment tools (RATs) aim to improve biopsy decision-making. We constructed a modeling framework to assess new RATs in men with gray zone PSA from the British Columbia healthcare system's perspective.MethodsWe evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a new RAT used in biopsy-naive men aged 50+ with a PSA of 3-10 ng/mL using a time-dependent state-transition model. The model was informed by engaging patient partners and using linked administrative health data, supplemented with published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the probability of the RAT being cost-effective were calculated. Probabilistic analysis was used to assess parameter uncertainty.ResultsIn the base case, a RAT based on an existing biomarker's characteristics was a dominant strategy associated with a cost savings of $44 and a quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gain of 0.00253 over 18 years of follow-up. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY, the probability that using a RAT is cost-effective relative to the SOC was 73%. Outcomes were sensitive to RAT costs and accuracy, especially the detection rate of high-grade PCa. Results were also impacted by PCa prevalence and assumptions about undetected PCa survival.ConclusionsOur findings showed that a more accurate RAT to guide biopsy can be cost-effective. Our proposed general model can be used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of any novel RAT.	[Mohammadi, Tima; Guh, Daphne P.; Tam, Alexander C.

J	Whittle, SL; Glennon, V; Buchbinder, R				Whittle, Samuel L.; Glennon, Vanessa; Buchbinder, Rachelle			Prioritization of clinical questions for the Australian Living Guideline for the Pharmacological Management of Inflammatory Arthritis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article; Early Access						guidelines; living evidence; rheumatoid arthritis	EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS; SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE RESEARCH; EXPERT OPINION; RESPONSE RATES; BROAD PANEL; RHEUMATOLOGISTS	AimLiving guidelines aim to reduce delays in translating new knowledge into practice by updating individual recommendations as soon as relevant new evidence emerges. We surveyed members of the Australian Rheumatology Association (ARA) to develop a list of priority questions for the Australian Living Guideline for the Pharmacological Management of Inflammatory Arthritis (ALG) and to explore clinicians' use of clinical practice guidelines.MethodsAn electronic survey of ARA members was performed in two phases. The first survey contained questions about current guideline use and beliefs and invited participants to submit at least three questions relevant to the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the second round, participants selected 10 questions they considered to be the highest priority from the collated list and ranked them in priority order. The sum of ranks was used to generate a final priority list.ResultsThere were 115 (21%) and 78 (14%) responses to the first and second survey rounds respectively. 87% of respondents use existing rheumatology guidelines in their usual practice, primarily EULAR guidelines. Most respondents favored the development of Australian rheumatology guidelines. In total, 34 potential recommendation topics were identified and ranked in order of priority.ConclusionA list of 34 clinical questions about RA management, ranked in order of importance by clinicians, has informed the development of the ALG. Similar prioritization exercises in other contexts may permit guidelines to be tailored to the needs of guideline users in their specific context, which may facilitate international collaboration and promote efficient translation of evidence to practice.

Quartz-based waste glass is commonly used as an additive to adjust the basicity of slag-based glass-ceramics. In this study, the quartz-based waste glasses were added to the Ti-bearing blast furnace slag to prepare the mixed solid waste glass-ceramics. The effects of waste glass content and heat treatment temperatures on the crystallization and performances of the prepared glass-ceramics were investigated. The results showed that as the waste glass content increased, the crystallization ability of the glass was weakened. Fassaite and nepheline were identified as the dominant crystalline phases in the prepared glass-ceramics and mainly featured a combination of both massive and dendritic forms. With increasing the heat treatment temperatures, the size of dendritic crystals first increased and then decreased. The optimal experimental conditions were identified as a waste glass content of 45%, a crystallization temperature of 900 & DEG;C, and a nucleation temperature of 730 & DEG;C. Under these conditions, the prepared glass-ceramics exhibited good crystalline phase distribution and excellent mechanical properties, including a Vickers hardness of 991.67 MPa and a flexural strength of 89.81 MPa. All the prepared solid waste-based glass-ceramics exhibited excellent chemical durabilities.

In our phase I/II clinical trials, 65 pediatric and adult patients with R/R T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) were enrolled (NCT04572308 and NCT04916860). Of these, 60 participants (T-ALL 35, T-LBL 25) received a single dose of naturally selected anti-CD7 CAR (NS7CAR) T cells at three levels: a low dose (5 x 10(5)/kg), a medium dose (1 to 1.5 x 10(6)/kg), and a high dose (2 x 10(6)/kg). On day 28, 94.4% of patients achieved deep complete remission (CR) in bone marrow. Among the 32 patients with extramedullary disease, 78.1% showed response, with 56.3% in CR and 21.9% in partial remission. The 2-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) were 63.5% (95% CI 47.7-79.4) and 53.7% (95% CI, 38.9-68.6), with no difference between pediatric and adult patients. PFS was signifi-cantly higher among the 37 CR patients who proceeded with consolidation transplant than the 10 patients who did not with 1-year PFS 67.2% (95% CI 51.9-82.4) versus 15.0% (95% CI 0-40.2), p < .0001. Of the 10 CR patients without transplants, eight relapsed, while two sustained CR on day 128, and day 180, respectively. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 91.7% of patients (grade 1/2 in 80.0%, grade 3/4 in 11.7%) and 5% of patients had neurotoxicity. NS7CAR-T therapy is effective in treat-ing R/R T-ALL/LBL patients with promising PFS while maintaining a manageable safety profile.

This enables the precise organization of guest molecules on the surfaces and results in diverse functionalities. However, the compatibility of DNA origami structures with catalytically active matter, a promising pathway to realize autonomous DNA machines, has so far been tested only in the context of bio-enzymatic activity, but not in chemically harsh reaction conditions. The latter are often required for catalytic processes involving high-energy fuels. Here, we provide proof-of-concept data showing that DNA origami structures are stable in 5 % hydrogen peroxide solutions over the course of at least three days. We report a protocol to couple these to platinum nanoparticles and show catalytic activity of the hybrid structures. We suggest that the presented hybrid structures are suitable to realize catalytic nanomachines combined with precisely engineered DNA nanostructures. DNA origami nanostructures are surprisingly stable in up to 5 % hydrogen peroxide over the course of three days and can thus be rendered catalytically active through efficient and reliable coupling to platinum nanoparticles.+image	[Alarcon-Correa, Mariana; Peter, Florian; Fischer, Peer] Max Planck Inst Med Res, Jahnstr 29, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Alarcon-Correa, Mariana; Peter, Florian; Fischer, Peer] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Mol Syst Engn & Adv Mat, INF 225, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Kilwing, Luzia; Liedl, Tim] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Phys, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Kilwing, Luzia; Liedl, Tim] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Nanosci CeNS, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany	Max Planck Society; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; University of Munich; University of Munich	Fischer, P (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Med Res, Jahnstr 29, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Fischer, P (corresponding author), Heidelberg Univ, Inst Mol Syst Engn & Adv Mat, INF 225, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.; Liedl, T (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Phys, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.; Liedl, T (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Ctr Nanosci CeNS, Geschwister Scholl Pl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.

The aim of this study was to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and determinants of drug use in patients with newly diagnosed ET in France and the United Kingdom.MethodsIncident cases of ET diagnosed between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2018 with 2 years of follow-up were identified by using The Health Improvement Network (THIN & REG;) general practice database. During the follow-up, we assessed the daily prevalence of use and potential switches from first-line to second-line treatment or other lines of treatment. Logistic regression models were conducted to assess the effect of demographic and clinical characteristics on the likelihood of receiving ET treatment.ResultsA total of 2957 and 3249 patients were selected in the United Kingdom and France, respectively. Among ET patients, drug use increased from 12 months to 1 month prior the date of index diagnosis (ID). After ID, nearly 40% of patients received at least one ET treatment, but during follow-up drug use decreased and at the end of the follow-up approximately 20% of patients were still on treatment. Among treated patients, & LE;10% maintained the same treatment throughout the entire follow-up, nearly 20% switched, and 40%-75% interrupted any treatment. Results from the multivariate analysis revealed that, both in France and the United Kingdom, patients receiving multiple concomitant therapies and affected by psychiatric conditions were more likely to receive an ET medication.ConclusionThis study shows that ET is an undertreated disease with a lower-than-expected number of patients receiving and maintaining pharmacological treatment. Misclassification of ET diagnosis should be acknowledged; thus, results require cautious interpretation.

In view of this, the fluid volume function method in computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the film forming performance and surface renewal performance in high viscosity zone of disk reactor. In the disk window area, the liquid film thickness becomes thinner and the surface update frequency becomes faster, indicating that the disk window has a positive effect. The devolatilization performance of five new disk structures under different operating conditions is compared and analyzed. It was found that the influence of liquid level height on film area was greater than that of viscosity and rotation speed, the porous sector disk has excellent surface renewal performance and the baffle can achieve better mass transfer efficiency at a distance of 45-60 mm from the disk. In order to improve the devolatilization performance, the film formation and liquid film surface renewal frequency of polymers with different disk structures in a rotating disk reactor were investigated.image	[Chen, Xupeng; Sun, Jianfei; Wu, Jintao; Yin, Jianzhong] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yaxin] Xinjiang Univ, Sch Chem Engn & technol, Key Lab Coal Clean Convers & Chem Engn Proc, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jianzhong] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China	Dalian University of Technology; Xinjiang University; Dalian University of Technology	Yin, JZ (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Chem Engn, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.	jzyin@dlut.edu.cn			National Key R&D Program of China [2020YFA0710202, 2018YFC0808805]	National Key R&D Program of China	National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2020YFA0710202, 2018YFC0808805		32	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0021-8995	1097-4628		J APPL POLYM SCI	J.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of adding nGO on the shear bond strength (SBS) of conventional (CGIC) and resin-modified GIC (RMGIC).Methods: Sixty intact molars were mounted and their occlusal surface was cut at a depth of 1 mm below the dentinoenamel junction. 1 wt.% and 2 wt.% of nGO (US Research Nanomaterials, Inc.) were added to CGIC and RMGIC (GC Corporation). The samples were randomly divided into six groups (n = 10), including 1: CGIC, 2: CGIC + 1% GO, 3: CGIC + 2% GO, 4: RMGIC, 5: RMGIC + 1% GO, and 6: RMGIC + 2% GO. Plastic molds were placed on the surface of the dentin pretreated with 10% polyacrylic acid (GC Corporation) and filled with prepared cement according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h of storage in an incubator, the SBS test was done by the universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests (p < .05).Results: In the group of CGIC, mean SBS was significantly lower than all other study groups (p < .001), and groups 5 (RMGIC + 1% GO) and 6 (RMGIC + 2% GO) showed significantly higher values compared to all other study groups (p < .001). However, the difference between groups 2 and 3, as well as the difference between groups 5 and 6, was not significant (p = .999 andp = .994, respectively). RMGI groups had significantly higher SBS than their corresponding CGIC groups.Conclusions: The addition of 1% and 2% nGO significantly increased the SBS of CGIC and RMGIC to the dentin, which can be considered as a promising point for wider clinical application of this material.

Phenotypic screens for new egress factors in apicomplexan parasites	MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						apicomplexan parasites; CRISPR/Cas9 screens; egress factors; forward genetic screens	DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA; TOXOPLASMA-GONDII; PROTOZOAN PARASITE; CRISPR SCREEN; GENES; IDENTIFICATION; REGULATOR; DIFFERENTIATION; MUTAGENESIS; MUTANTS	Apicomplexans, such as Plasmodium and Toxoplasma are obligate intracellular parasites that invade, replicate and finally EXIT their host cell. During replication within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), the parasites establish an extensive F-actin-containing network that connects individual parasites and is required for material exchange, recycling and the final steps of daughter cell assembly. After multiple rounds of replication, the parasites exit the host cell involving multiple signalling cascades, disassembly of the network, secretion of microneme proteins and activation of the acto-myosin motor. Blocking the host cell EXIT process leads to the formation of large PVs, making the screening for genes involved in exiting the cell relatively straightforward. Given that apicomplexans are highly diverse from other eukaryotes, approximately 30% of all genes are annotated as hypothetical, some apicomplexan-specific factors are likely to be critical during EXIT. This motivated several labs to design and perform forward genetic and phenotypic screens using various approaches, such as random insertion mutagenesis, temperature-sensitive mutants and, more recently, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted editing and conditional mutagenesis. Here we will provide an overview of the technological developments over recent years and the most successful stories that led to the identification of new critical factors in Toxoplasma gondii.

In a diary study among 96 employees over 10 consecutive workdays (NOccasion = 960, NEmployee = 96), we found that at the daily level, hindrance appraisal strengthens (a) the effects of challenge appraisal of job demands on job meaningfulness and activated positive emotions and (b) the indirect effects of challenge appraisal on task performance via job meaningfulness and activated positive emotions. Furthermore, the strengthening effects of hindrance appraisal are more pronounced as individual trait performance-prove goal orientation increases, but they do not vary as individual trait learning goal orientation decreases. These research findings shed light on effort justification in explaining the interaction effects of challenge and hindrance appraisals and the role of goal orientation in the process.

Allelopathy-selected microbiomes mitigate chemical inhibition of plant performance	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article; Early Access						allelochemical; disturbance frequency; microbial mediation; plant-microbial interaction; rhizobacteria	CERATIOLA-ERICOIDES EMPETRACEAE; FLORIDA SCRUB; SOIL MICROBES; RESISTANCE; MECHANISM; COMMUNITY; INVASION; SEQUENCE; ECOLOGY; IMPACT	Allelopathy is a common and important stressor that shapes plant communities and can alter soil microbiomes, yet little is known about the direct effects of allelochemical addition on bacterial and fungal communities or the potential for allelochemical-selected microbiomes to mediate plant performance responses, especially in habitats naturally structured by allelopathy.Here, we present the first community-wide investigation of microbial mediation of allelochemical effects on plant performance by testing how allelopathy affects soil microbiome structure and how these microbial changes impact germination and productivity across 13 plant species.The soil microbiome exhibited significant changes to 'core' bacterial and fungal taxa, bacterial composition, abundance of functionally important bacterial and fungal taxa, and predicted bacterial functional genes after the addition of the dominant allelochemical native to this habitat. Furthermore, plant performance was mediated by the allelochemical-selected microbiome, with allelopathic inhibition of plant productivity moderately mitigated by the microbiome.Through our findings, we present a potential framework to understand the strength of plant-microbial interactions in the presence of environmental stressors, in which frequency of the ecological stress may be a key predictor of microbiome-mediation strength.

We reviewed the current evidence supporting functional preservation in sinonasal cancer treatment. Primary surgery with or without adjuvant modalities continues to be the standard of care for sinonasal cancer. Unfortunately, functional compromise remains a dominant negative feature of this approach. More recently, through advances in therapeutic techniques and improved understanding of the relevant tumor biology, treatments aimed at preserving function and cosmesis are emerging. The evidence for such progress involving minimal access surgery, surgical reconstruction for rehabilitation, new techniques in radiation therapy, inclusion of systemic and locally enhanced chemotherapy, and therapeutic agents based on molecular targets are highlighted. This multi-prong approach bodes well for future patients with sinonasal cancer to undergo successful treatment that includes maximal preservation of associated functions.

J	Setser, BW				Setser, Brad W.			The Common Framework and its Discontents	DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE			English	Article; Early Access								The Common Framework is the internationally agreed process for coordinating the restructuring of the debt of low-income countries. To date, this process, which was established by the G20 in late 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, has failed to provide an efficient path toward agreement with new bilateral creditors (such as China), market creditors and the traditional bilateral creditors. An analysis of the key country cases demonstrates how tensions between different creditors have complicated the application of the Common Framework and delayed agreement on new financial terms. The Common Framework was built on a case-by-case judgement of the scale of debt relief needed. It has become a case-by-case negotiation on the format for carrying out a restructuring, as well as the terms of the restructuring. China's participation in official creditor committees, the clear innovation in the Common Framework, has proved to be a source of delay rather than a mechanism for creating consensus. Almost three years after the initial agreement on the Common Framework, there still is no model for an internationally coordinated restructuring that both delivers significant debt relief and includes the Chinese policy banks.

However, the efficiencies of solar cells and modules based on vapor-deposited perovskites are significantly lower than those fabricated using the solution method. Emerging evidence suggests that large defects are generated during vapor deposition owing to a specific top-down crystallization mechanism. Herein, a hybrid vapor deposition method combined with solvent-assisted recrystallization for fabricating high-quality large-area perovskite films with low defect densities is presented. It is demonstrated that an intermediate phase can be formed at the grain boundaries, which induces the secondary growth of small grains into large ones. Consequently, perovskite films with substantially reduced grain boundaries and defect densities are fabricated. Results of temperature-dependent charge-carrier dynamics show that the proposed method successfully suppresses all recombination reactions. Champion efficiencies of 21.9% for small-area (0.16 cm2) cells and 19.9% for large-area (10.0 cm2) solar modules under AM 1.5 G irradiation are achieved. Moreover, the modules exhibit high operational stability, i.e., they retain >92% of their initial efficiencies after 200 h of continuous operation.

However, it is only applicable to circularly-polarized light and encounters substantial challenges when applied to wave fields lacking the intrinsic spin degree of freedom. Here, a new paradigm is presented for achieving geometric phase by elucidating the concept of topological complementary pair (TCP), which arises from the combination of two compact phase elements possessing opposite intrinsic topological charge. Twisting the TCP leads to the generation of a linearly-varying geometric phase of arbitrary order, which is quantified by the intrinsic topological charge. Notably distinct from the conventional spin-orbit coupling-based theories, the proposed geometric phase is the direct result of the cyclic evolution of orbital-angular-momentum transformation in mode space, thereby exhibiting universality across classical wave systems. As a proof of concept, the existence of this geometric phase is experimentally demonstrated using scalar acoustic waves, showcasing the remarkable ability in the precise manipulation of acoustic waves at subwavelength scales. These findings engender a fresh understanding of wave-matter interaction in compact structures and establish a promising platform for exploring geometric phase, offering significant opportunities for diverse applications in wave systems. Geometric phase is a powerful strategy for controlling light waves, which is solely applicable to spin light and not available for wave fields lacking intrinsic spin. By utilizing the cyclic evolution of OAM transformation, this study presents a general approach through topological complementary pair to achieve geometric phase and showcases its remarkable proficiency in controlling sound waves at subwavelength scales.image	[Zhang, Kun; Li, Xiao; Dong, Daxing; Xue, Ming; You, Wen-Long; Liu, Youwen; Xu, Yadong] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut NUAA, Coll Phys, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Mat & Phys MIIT, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China; [Gao, Lei; Jiang, Jian-Hua; Xu, Yadong] Soochow Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Thin Films, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China; [Chen, Huanyang] Xiamen Univ, Dept Phys, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Fu, Yangyang] Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut NUAA, State Key Lab Mech & Control Aerosp Struct, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China	Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics; Soochow University - China; Xiamen University; Nanjing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics	Xu, YD (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut NUAA, Coll Phys, Key Lab Aerosp Informat Mat & Phys MIIT, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.; Xu, YD (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Thin Films, Suzhou 215006, Peoples R China.; Chen, HY (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, Dept Phys, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.; Fu, YY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut NUAA, State Key Lab Mech & Control Aerosp Struct, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.	kenyon@xmu.edu.cn; ydxu@suda.edu.cn; yyfu@nuaa.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [12274225, 11974010, 12274313, 92050102, 12374410]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20230089]; National Key R&D Program of China [2022YFA1404300, 2022YFA1404400]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [NE2022007, 20720220033, 20720230102]; Innovation Training Fund for College Students [202210287099Z]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); National Key R&D Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Innovation Training Fund for College Students	K.Z., X.L., and D.D. contributed equally to this work.

However, for the current biomimetic materials, their organic-inorganic heterostructures typically exhibit poor uniformity, weak interfacial bonding, and various defects, limiting the breakthrough in strength and toughness. Herein, an ultra-strong and transparent biomimetic nanocomposite is presented by combining orientation effects and in situ biomineralization to precisely engineer each level of the hierarchy. The orientation of nanofiber provides long-range and order matrix to remarkably eliminate defects, promote multi-scale interfacial bonding and increase the crystalline degree and size of organic matrix; while the in situ mineralization of amorphous inorganic oligomers firmly welds the organic-inorganic interface together to form a continuous and homogeneous monolithic structure. Due to the unique structural features, the nanocomposite exhibits a tensile strength of up to 1168.1 +/- 10.2 MPa and a toughness of 34.1 +/- 0.8 MJ m(-3). Furthermore, the nanocomposite film is imparted with high transparence and anisotropic optical properties. This work is expected to provide insights into the design of high-performance biomineralized materials from structural coupling to precisely controlling interfaces and microstructure.

J	Zheng, JH; An, J				Zheng, Jihui; An, Jing			A Legendre spectral-Galerkin method for fourth-order problems in cylindrical regions	NUMERICAL METHODS FOR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						cylindrical region; error estimation; fourth-order problem; Spectral method	ALLEN-CAHN; TRANSMISSION; APPROXIMATION; ELEMENT	A spectral-Galerkin method based on Legendre-Fourier approximation for fourth-order problems in cylindrical regions is studied in this paper. By the cylindrical coordinate transformation, a three-dimensional fourth-order problem in a cylindrical region is transformed into a sequence of decoupled fourth-order problems with two dimensions and the corresponding pole conditions are also derived. With appropriately constructed weighted Sobolev space, a weak form is established. Based on this weak form, a spectral-Galerkin discretization scheme is proposed and its error is rigorously analyzed by defining a new class of projection operators. Then, a set of efficient basis functions are used to write the discrete scheme as the linear systems with a sparse matrix based on tensor product. Numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and high-accuracy of the developed method. Finally, an application of the proposed method to the fourth-order Steklov problem and the corresponding numerical experiments once again confirm the efficiency and spectral accuracy of the method.

Facile microwave synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes for modification of elastomer used as heaters	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						ferrocene and graphite; heat dissipation; heaters; MWCNTs; thermal and electrical conductivities	GROWTH	Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized by a microwave method. MWCNTs had filamentous shapes (10 & mu;m) and were intertwined in bundles (40-60 nm diameter). The rapid oxidation of MWCNTs with a loss of 90% of weight was observed from 530 to 630 & DEG;C. 2% Residue was present at 630 & DEG;C, which gradually decreased to 1.2% at 1000 & DEG;C. In a silicone elastomer, increased thermal conductivity at a concentration of 8% MWCNTs was observed. The highest thermal conductivity of the nano-modified elastomer was 0.48 W/m & DEG;C with 8.0 wt% MWCNTs. The highest electrical conductivity was 2.4 x 10-5 S cm-1 at 8.0 wt% MWCNTs. Both the thermal and electrical conductivities showed percolation behavior with the percolation thresholds at 6 and 5 wt%, respectively. The MWCNTs synthesized by microwave method gave a good power economy in comparison to MWCNTs obtained by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on NiMg catalyst. Microwave-synthesized MWCNTs showed high stability at a potential of 250 V in an electrical resistance heater application due to the presence of Fe on the surface of MWCNTs. The developed heater can effectively operate at 220 V, which enables the use of the tubes in household appliances, such as heat fans, irons, and washing machines.HighlightsSynthesis of MWCNTs by microwave plasma treatment of ferrocene and graphite.Characterization of MWCNTs by different techniques.Concentration dependence of electro- and thermal conductivity of MWCNTs in elastomers.Electro-physical parameters studies of elastomers modified with MWCNTs.Heat generation studies in elastomeric matrix with MWCNTs.

Current models for predicting the risk of PPM after TAVR are not designed to be applied clinically to assist with preprocedural planning.MethodsPatients undergoing TAVR at the University of Colorado were split into a training cohort for the development of a predictive model, and a testing cohort for model validation. Stepwise and binary logistic regressions were performed on the training cohort to produce a predictive model. Beta coefficients from the binary logistic regression were used to create a simple scoring system for predicting the need for PPM implantation. Scores were then applied to the validation cohort to assess predictive accuracy.Results: Patients undergoing TAVR from 2013 to 2019 were analyzed: with 483 included in the training cohort and 123 included in the validation cohort. The need for a pacemaker was associated with five preprocedure variables in the training cohort: PR interval > 200 ms, Right bundle branch block, valve-In-valve procedure, prior Myocardial infarction, and self-Expandable valve. The PRIME score was developed using these clinical features, and was highly accurate for predicting PPM in both the training and model validation cohorts (area under the curve 0.804 and 0.830 in the model training and validation cohorts, respectively).Conclusions: The PRIME score is a simple and accurate preprocedural tool for predicting the need for PPM implantation after TAVR.

J	Cheng, H; Sun, FL; Ouyang, YL; Li, CB				Cheng, Hai; Sun, Fenglan; Ouyang, Yaoling; Li, Chengbin			Correlation analysis of IL-37 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to chronic HBV infection among Han people in Central China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOGENETICS			English	Article; Early Access						hepatitis B virus; interleukin-37; polymorphism; susceptibility	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; DISEASE	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for various liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which pose a significant threat to human health. An ineffective immune response to HBV can result in viral chronicity. Interleukin-37 (IL-37), an immunomodulator, is capable of inhibiting both innate and adaptive immune responses. It is believed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the IL-37 gene could contribute to the regulation of HBV clearance. Our aim to conduct this study was to investigate whether SNPs in the IL-37 gene were associated with the risk of chronic HBV infection in adults. A total of 342 participants, consisting of 171 cases and 171 controls, were recruited for this study. Sanger sequencing was employed for genotyping six SNPs (rs3811042 G/A, rs3811043 G/C, rs2466449 A/G, rs3811045 C/T, rs3811046 T/G and rs3811047G/A). There was no significant difference in allele and genotype distribution between the two groups, and the constructed haplotypes were not found to be associated with the risk of chronic HBV infection. Our results revealed that there was no relationship between these six SNPs (rs3811042G/A, rs3811043G/C, rs2466449A/G, rs3811045C/T, rs3811046T/G and rs3811047G/A) in the IL-37 gene and susceptibility to chronic HBV infection among Han people in Central China.

The aims of this research were to: (1) describe A&T's SBC implementation processes and their impact based on a review of programme documents and peer-reviewed publications and (2) gather lessons learned from key informant interviews (N = 23) with A&T staff and stakeholders in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Vietnam. A&T's SBC approach used interpersonal communication, community mobilization and mass media to address knowledge gaps, strengthen self-efficacy and shift social norms. The initiative used data for design and evaluation and facilitated scale and sustainability through close collaboration with governments and other stakeholders. A&T's approach increased exclusive breastfeeding, minimum meal frequency of children and use of iron and folic acid tablets by pregnant women, but had mixed impacts on early initiation of breastfeeding and maternal and child dietary diversity. Multiple SBC channels and frequent contacts strengthened the impact of SBC on MIYCN practices. Lessons learned included: using existing large-scale platforms for interpersonal communication, improving counselling skills of health workers, delivering timely tailored messages, engaging key influencers to take specific actions, using research to address underlying behavioural concerns and maximize mass media reach and frequency, using simple memorable messages and employing additional channels to reach low media coverage areas. A&T developed and implemented at-scale MIYCN SBC in multiple countries, providing lessons learned about intervention strategies, engagement of influencers and mass media campaign development, which governments and other implementers can adapt and replicate.

J	Guimaraes, N; Campos, R; Jorge, A				Guimaraes, Nuno; Campos, Ricardo; Jorge, Alipio			Pre-trained language models: What do they know?	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article; Early Access						large language models; natural language; pretrained language models; processing		Large language models (LLMs) have substantially pushed artificial intelligence (AI) research and applications in the last few years. They are currently able to achieve high effectiveness in different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, named entity recognition, text classification, question answering, or text summarization. Recently, significant attention has been drawn to OpenAI's GPT models' capabilities and extremely accessible interface. LLMs are nowadays routinely used and studied for downstream tasks and specific applications with great success, pushing forward the state of the art in almost all of them. However, they also exhibit impressive inference capabilities when used off the shelf without further training. In this paper, we aim to study the behavior of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in some inference tasks they were not initially trained for. Therefore, we focus our attention on very recent research works related to the inference capabilities of PLMs in some selected tasks such as factual probing and common-sense reasoning. We highlight relevant achievements made by these models, as well as some of their current limitations that open opportunities for further research.This article is categorized under:Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Key Design Issues in DataMiningTechnologies > Artificial Intelligence	[Guimaraes, Nuno; Campos, Ricardo; Jorge, Alipio] LIAAD INESCTEC, Porto, Portugal; [Guimaraes, Nuno; Jorge, Alipio] Univ Porto, Porto, Portugal; [Campos, Ricardo] Univ Beira Interior, Covilha, Portugal; [Campos, Ricardo] Polytech Inst Tomar, Ci2 Smart Cities Res Ctr, Tomar, Portugal	Universidade do Porto; INESC TEC; Universidade do Porto; Universidade da Beira Interior; Instituto Politecnico de Tomar	Guimaraes, N (corresponding author), LIAAD INESCTEC, Porto, Portugal.	nuno.r.guimaraes@inesctec.pt			FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; Component 5-Capitalization and Business Innovation [2022.09312]; European Union (EU); Next Generation EU;  [41]	FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Component 5-Capitalization and Business Innovation; European Union (EU)(European Union (EU)CGIAR); Next Generation EU; 	FCT-Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: 2022.09312.PTDC; Component 5-Capitalization and Business Innovation, Grant/Award Number: 41; European Union (EU); Next Generation EU		56	0	0	1	1	WILEY PERIODICALS, INC	SAN FRANCISCO	ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA	1942-4787	1942-4795		WIRES DATA MIN KNOWL	Wiley Interdiscip.

Among eukaryotes, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family stands as the largest group of membrane proteins. Alterations in GPCR gene expression and dysregulation of signal transduction have been recognized as the markers of malignancy. As a member of the GPCR family, G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) exhibits unknown functions in tumors, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)Methods: We explored the expression and prognosis of GPR37 in NSCLC through TCGA, GTEx, GEO, and GEPIA2. We detected the expression of GPR37 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The study explored the influence of GPR37 on tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, we examined the effects of GPR37 on tumor cell apoptosis and invasion. Most importantly, we investigated whether GPR37 affects cisplatin-induced drug resistance in NSCLC. Furthermore, by conducting animal experiments, we assessed the impact of GPR37 on NSCLC and delved into underlying mechanisms.Results: (1) In NSCLC, the expression of GPR37 is markedly higher than that in corresponding normal tissues. We found that elevated GPR37 expression predicts an unfavorable prognosis. (2) It was demonstrated that GPR37 positively regulates NSCLC cell invasion, migration, and proliferation, suppresses cell apoptosis, heightens resistance to cisplatin, and promotes tumor formation and growth. Conversely, we observed that GPR37 knockdown suppresses NSCLC cell invasion, migration, and proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis, increases sensitivity to cisplatin, and affects tumor formation and growth. (3) GPR37 activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction pathways to mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby promoting the progression of NSCLC.Conclusions: It was suggested that GPR37 acts a crucial role in promoting the occurrence and development of NSCLC. Knockdown of GPR37 significantly inhibits the occurrence and development of NSCLC. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that GPR37 may represent a viable therapeutic target for NSCLC.

Self-regulation in daily life: Neuroscience will accelerate theorizing and advance the field	SOCIAL AND PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY COMPASS			English	Article; Early Access						daily life; EEG; fMRI; neuroscience; self-regulation	COGNITIVE REGULATION; EMOTION REGULATION; STRATEGIES; REAPPRAISAL; FOOD	Self-regulation often involves foregoing short-term pleasures and impulses in favor of long-term goals, such as pursuing a particular career, raising a family, or maintaining good health to promote longevity. Like many other fields in psychology, the study of self-regulation has experienced some growing pains in the wake of the replication crisis, with previously held theories called into question, including seemingly intuitive phenomena such as ego depletion. Despite these challenges, there is burgeoning interest in characterizing people's experiences of self-regulation success and failure in real world settings. In this review, I argue that utilizing tools and approaches from neuroscience will yield valuable insights into how self-regulatory processes are engaged in daily life, which in turn will refine and advance self-regulation models and theorizing, as well as generate new hypotheses. I also unpack some conceptual and practical considerations when combining neuroscience methods with real-world assessment of behaviors, such as ecological momentary assessment. With these issues and points for consideration taken together, I hope this review will help pave a fruitful path forward for the field with implications for how we might become better self-regulators.

Automatic analysis of these injuries is however challenging, as MRI resolutions vary for different planes of analysis and physiological features are often distorted around these injuries. This study proposes a new CNN-based segmentation method in which information is exchanged between two networks analyzing the scans from different planes. Our aim was to develop a robust method for automatic segmentation of the spinal cord in patients having suffered traumatic injuries. The database consisted of 106 sagittal MRI scans from 94 patients with traumatic spinal cord injuries. Our method used an innovative approach where the scans were analyzed in series under the axial and sagittal plane by two different convolutional networks. The results were compared with those of Deepseg 2D from the Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), which was taken as state-of-the-art. Comparisons were evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation combined with statistical t-test results on separate test data. Our method achieved significantly better results than Deepseg 2D, with an average Dice coefficient of 0.95 against 0.88 for Deepseg 2D (p <0.001). Other metrics were also used to compare the segmentations, all of which showed significantly better results for our approach. In this study, we introduce a robust method for spinal cord segmentation which is capable of adequately segmenting spinal cords affected by traumatic injuries, improving upon the methods contained in SCT.

To improve the measurement and conceptualization of HID, we examined the utility of adding a time qualifier to define what constitutes an occasion of HID using repeated daily surveys in a sample of young adults.MethodsParticipants were selected from a nationally representative sample of 12th-grade students in the United States who participated in the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study in Spring 2018. In 2019 and 2020, young adults (at modal ages 19-20) responded to annual and daily (14 consecutive days per year) online surveys about their alcohol use.ResultsWhen we compared moderate drinking days (less than 4/5 drinks for women/men), binge drinking days (4-7/5-9 drinks), and HID days (8+/10+ drinks), HID days had the longest duration of drinking (5.2 h), highest peak estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC, 0.30%), and greatest drinking pace (2.58 drinks/h). HID was associated with a greater number of negative consequences than either moderate or binge drinking; adjusting for time spent drinking did not impact this interpretation. HID was reported on 10.9% of days; when defined as 8/10+ drinks in 4 h or 2 h, HID was reported on 4.8% and 1.0% of days, respectively. Nearly all differences in eBAC and negative consequences persisted across drinking intensity despite the introduction of time constraints.ConclusionsHID days were characterized by both a longer time spent drinking and a more rapid pace of drinking. Adding a time qualifier to the definition of HID would restrict variability by only describing the minority of days and does not improve the distinctions among levels of risk.

These reactive intermediates engage in asymmetric [2+1] cycloadditions and hence open entry into valuable trifluoromethylated cyclopropane or -cyclopropene derivatives in optically active form, which are important building blocks for medicinal chemistry but difficult to make otherwise. 1,1-Disubstituted (trifluoromethyl)cyclopropanes represent bioisostereres of tert-butyl groups of improved metabolic stability; they are on high demand in medicinal chemistry but difficult to make in optically active form. A new approach, which engages a bench-stable carbene source in asymmetric cyclopropanation catalyzed by a [BiRh] paddlewheel complex, opens ready access to compounds of this type.image	[Peeters, Matthias; Decaens, Jonathan; Fuerstner, Alois] Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, Ruhr Mulheim Ruhr, D-45470 Mulheim, Ruhr, Germany	Max Planck Society	Fürstner, A (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Kohlenforsch, Ruhr Mulheim Ruhr, D-45470 Mulheim, Ruhr, Germany.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) poisoning: The early years	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						acetaminophen; glutathione; hepatotoxicity; N-acetylcysteine; nomogram; overdose; paracetamol	INDUCED HEPATIC-NECROSIS; INTRAVENOUS N-ACETYLCYSTEINE; LIVER-INJURY; HOSPITAL PRESENTATION; ADVERSE-REACTIONS; HALF-LIFE; OVERDOSE; METHIONINE; MANAGEMENT; FAILURE	Paracetamol (acetaminophen) was marketed in the 1950s as a nonprescription analgesic/antipyretic without any preclinical toxicity studies. It became used increasingly for self-poisoning, particularly in the UK and was belatedly found to cause acute liver damage, which could be fatal. Management of poisoned patients was difficult as maximum abnormalities of liver function were delayed for 3 days or more after an overdose. There was no treatment and the mechanism of hepatotoxicity was not known. The paracetamol half-life was prolonged with liver damage occurring when it exceeded 4 h and the Rumack-Matthew nomogram was an important advance that allowed stratification of patients into separate zones of risk. It is used to guide prognosis and treatment and its predictive value could be increased by combining it with the paracetamol half-life. The problems of a sheep farmer in Australia in the early 1970s led to the discovery of the mechanism of paracetamol hepatotoxicity, and the first effective treatment of overdosage with intravenous (IV) cysteamine. This had unpleasant side effects and administration was difficult. N-acetylcysteine soon became the treatment of choice for paracetamol overdose and given early it was very effective when administered either IV or orally. N-acetylcysteine could cause anaphylactoid reactions, particularly early during IV administration when the concentrations were highest. Simpler and shorter regimes with slower initial rates of infusion have now been introduced with a reduced incidence of these adverse effects. In addition, there has been a move to use larger doses of N-acetylcysteine given over longer periods for patients who are more severely poisoned and those with risk factors. There has been much interest recently in the search for novel biomarkers such as microRNAs, procalcitonin and cyclophilin that promise to have greater specificity and sensitivity than transaminases. Paracetamol-protein adducts predict hepatotoxicity and are specific biomarkers of toxic paracetamol metabolite exposure. Another approach would be measurement of the plasma levels of cysteine and inorganic sulfate. It is 50 years since the first effective treatment for paracetamol poisoning and, apart from liver transplantation, there is still no effective treatment for patients who present late.

Here we demonstrate a practical surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate using zirconium nitride (ZrN) thin films grown by reactive gas-timing (RGT) rf magnetron sputtering. The tailored properties of ZrN thin film exploited for SERS activity could be achieved to obtain a highly sensitive ZrN thin film SERS substrate with the enhancement factor (EF) of 1.24 x 106 and 4.8 %RSD at 1626 cm-1 toward methylene blue (MB) analyte which are comparable to the optimized Au sputtered thin films (EF=1.18 x 106 and with 5.1%RSD). We find that the spatial plasmonic hotspots on the surface of ZrN SERS substrate controlled by the turn-on timing of Ar:N2 sputtered gas sequence, leading to the discrete conductive surface profile, strongly relates to non-stoichiometric composition and the degree of (200)-oriented texture at the surface of ZrN thin film. Furthermore, ZrN thin film SERS substrates exhibit an excellent recyclability more than 30 cycles with simple cleaning process and a storage time longer than 6 months. The detection and reusability of ZrN SERS substrate on the low concentration of trinitrotoluene (TNT) for homeland security are also performed. Alternative plasmonic materials based on sputtered zirconium nitride (ZrN) thin films is exploited for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrate.

Photothermal methods have advantages in intracellular delivery, particularly in in vivo manipulation. However, the inability of directional transmission of exogenous molecules limits their delivery efficiency. Here, a photothermal pump (PTP) patch with numerous "exogenous molecular reservoirs" is reported. Under a laser, the cell membrane ruptures, while "exogenous molecular reservoirs" shrink, resulting in a directional exogenous molecule delivery into cells for a high-efficient intracellular delivery. The PTP patches are considered a universal structure for a highly efficient, nondestructive, and in-vitro/vivo-applicable intracellular macromolecule delivery. Under in vivo transdermal intracellular delivery conditions, the target genes are efficiently and noninvasively delivered into epidermal and dermal cells through the PTP patch and exosomes produced by the epidermal cells, respectively. The PTP patch provides a new strategy for a high-efficiency, nondestructive, and in-vitro/vivo-applicable macromolecule delivery. A photothermal pump patch is proposed as a universal structure for a highly efficient, non-destructive, and in-vitro/vivo-applicable intracellular macromolecule directional delivery. It is based on poly(dimethyl siloxane) photothermal expansion-driven pore shrinkage, which directionally delivers macromolecules into the cell to improve intracellular delivery efficiency. It is also suitable for transdermal intracellular delivery and has broad potential in the fields of cell/gene therapy.image	[Tang, Heming; Yang, He; Huang, Jialei; Wang, Lei; Chen, Hong] Soochow Univ, State & Local Joint Engn Lab Novel Funct Polymer M, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China; [Tang, Heming; Fei, Liyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Hangzhou Inst Med HIM, Zhejiang Canc Hosp, Canc Hosp,Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Hangzhou 310022, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Wenjun; Liu, Zhuang] Soochow Univ, Inst Funct Nano & Soft Mat Lab FUNSOM, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei] Jiangsu Biosurf Biotech Co Ltd, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China	Soochow University - China; Zhejiang Cancer Hospital; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Soochow University - China	Wang, L; Chen, H (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, State & Local Joint Engn Lab Novel Funct Polymer M, Coll Chem Chem Engn & Mat Sci, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.; Wang, L (corresponding author), Jiangsu Biosurf Biotech Co Ltd, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.	wangl@biosurf.cn; chenh@suda.edu.cn		yang, he/0000-0001-5514-2370	National Natural Science Foundation of China [21905190, 21935008]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21905190, 21935008).

The polytetrafluoroethylene-polyphenylene sulfide/silicon dioxide (PTFE-PPS/SiO2) lubricant coating is subsequently deposited on texture surfaces by electrohydrodynamic atomization. USRP texturing not only forms the texture shapes but also realizes the strengthening effects of increased hardness and residual stress. Synergistic effects of the PTFE-PPS/SiO2 coating and different USRP textures on dry friction and wear properties are investigated. The results show that the synergistic effect of the linear texture with two processing times and the PTFE-PPS/SiO2 coating achieves better dry friction and wear performance than the individual effect. The texture shape and the processing times both affect the synergistic effect. The increase in processing times has a positive effect on synergistic improvement. The linear texture plays a better synergistic effect compared with that of the wavy texture with the same processing times. The USRP textures affect the tribological properties of texture-coating samples by mainly influencing the coating-substrate adhesion. The texture with an appropriate shape and height can improve the adhesion with the coating, and thus synergistically improve the dry friction and wear properties of the substrate.

Thin-film filtration is a suitable method to avoid the limiting effect of the filter cakes. Gas-impermeable filter membranes prevent shrinkage cracking, which can occur during demoisturing of the filter cakes. Titanium dioxide and baker's yeast are used as model particle systems, which are present in different concentrations and are filtered with track-etched membranes in different particle-to-pore size ratios. The parameters determined during the investigation are the residual moisture, the specific solid mass, and the completeness of the discharge. Filtration causes progressive blocking of the membrane pores, resulting in filter medium resistances that are increased by up to a factor of 175. Metabolism of yeast can cause bubbles to accumulate on the membrane and decreasing the free filter area. Without regeneration the specific solid mass flow rate is reduced by 61 % for titanium dioxide and by 13 % for yeast under ideal conditions of this experimental study. The impact of a particle system on the roller discharge is investigated comparing the behavior of the inorganic white pigment titanium dioxide and the biological model organism yeast. The quality of the removal properties of the filter cakes on a laboratory drum filter is recorded. Five different track-etched membranes are used to assess the filter properties with varying particle-pore size ratios. image	[Baechle, Volker; Gleiss, Marco; Nirschl, Hermann] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Mech Proc Engn & Mech MVM, Str Forum 8, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany	Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology	Bächle, V (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Mech Proc Engn & Mech MVM, Str Forum 8, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.	volker.baechle@kit.edu			German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) [21039 N]	German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF)	The authors would like to thank the German Federation of Industrial Research Associations (AiF) for the financial support (IGF number 21039 N) and all colleagues and students, especially Simon Egner, for the support in writing this paper.		29	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	0930-7516	1521-4125		CHEM ENG TECHNOL	Chem.

High-Entropy Oxysulfide for High-Performance Oxygen Evolution Reactions Electrocatalyst	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						electrocatalysts; electrochemical stability; high-entropy oxysulfides; oxygen evolution reaction; water splitting	CATALYST; NANOSHEETS; BATTERY	Hydrogen energy is considered as a significant clean, green, and renewable energy technology. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays an important role in hydrogen production through overall electrochemical water splitting. Herein, novel transition- and rare-earth metal-based high-entropy oxysulfides (HEOS) are synthesized via low-temperature hydrothermal method to overcome the immiscibility issue of sulfur. HEOS with systematically varying sulfur content are investigated as electrocatalysts in the OER for the first time. To assess the contribution of sulfur toward OER, the electrocatalytic performance of oxysulfides is compared with high-entropy oxides (not containing sulfur). HEOS with higher sulfur content shows superior electrocatalytic activity and outperforms the high-entropy oxides. The considerable amount of sulfate left in the structure during electrolysis contributes to the catalytic activity. The HEOS exhibits a reasonable overpotential of 348 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and outstanding electrochemical stability of 100 h of testing. The extraordinary OER activity of complex HEOS demonstrates its viability in rational design of highly efficient oxysulfide catalyst for overall water-splitting. Novel transition- and rare-earth metal-based high-entropy oxysulfides are synthesized via low-temperature hydrothermal method to overcome the immiscibility issue of sulfur. The oxysulfide exhibits a reasonably low overpotential of 348 mV at 10 mA cm-2 during oxygen evolution reaction, along with excellent operational stability for over 100 h at 10 mA cm-2, without severe overpotential increase.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH	[Chatterjee, Arindam; Bhattacharya, Subramshu S.] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Nano Funct Mat Technol Ctr NFMTC, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ghosh, Anamika; Ganguly, Dipsikha; Sundara, Ramaprabhu] Indian Inst Technol Madras, Nano Funct Mat Technol Ctr NFMTC, Dept Phys, Alternat Energy & Nanotechnol Lab AENL, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India	Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Madras	Bhattacharya, SS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Nano Funct Mat Technol Ctr NFMTC, Dept Met & Mat Engn, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.; Sundara, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Madras, Nano Funct Mat Technol Ctr NFMTC, Dept Phys, Alternat Energy & Nanotechnol Lab AENL, Chennai 600036, Tamil Nadu, India.	ramp@iitm.ac.in; ssb@iitm.ac.in		Sundara, Ramaprabhu/0000-0002-7960-9470	This research was conducted at Nano Functional Materials Technology Centre (NFMTC) funded by DST, Government of India (Gol) and Alternative Energy and Nanotechnology laboratory (AENL), IIT Madras.; DST, Government of India; Alternative Energy and Nanotechnology laboratory (AENL), IIT Madras	This research was conducted at Nano Functional Materials Technology Centre (NFMTC) funded by DST, Government of India (Gol) and Alternative Energy and Nanotechnology laboratory (AENL), IIT Madras.; DST, Government of India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Alternative Energy and Nanotechnology laboratory (AENL), IIT Madras	This research was conducted at Nano Functional Materials Technology Centre (NFMTC) funded by DST, Government of India (Gol) and Alternative Energy and Nanotechnology laboratory (AENL), IIT Madras.		45	0	0	5	5	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	2194-4288	2194-4296		ENERGY TECHNOL-GER	Energy Technol.	2023 SEP 20	2023										10.1002/ente.202300490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ente.202300490		SEP 2023	8	Energy & Fuels	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Energy & Fuels	S2RB9					2023-10-18	WOS:001069683400001

Reaction Mechanism and Effect of Substituent in Direct Bromination of Indoles	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Ab initio calculations; Bromination of indoles; Molecular electrostatic potential; Reaction mechanism; Substituent effect		A reaction mechanism for the direct bromination of substituted indoles in dimethylformamide solution at 298.15 K and 1 atm is proposed and studied. It consists of two steps, the first one, in which the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Br2 overlaps with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the substituted indole, is the rate-determining step. A linear correlation is observed between the electron-withdrawing power of the substituent (expressed through the relative molecular electrostatic potential) and the Gibbs free energy barrier of the reaction's rate-determining step, & UDelta;GTS1 & NOTEQUAL; ${\Delta {G}_{TS1}<^>{{\ne}}}$. This correlation is suggested for estimating & UDelta;GTS1 & NOTEQUAL; ${\Delta {G}_{TS1}<^>{{\ne}}}$ in other unexplored cases. The variation of & UDelta;GTS1 & NOTEQUAL; ${\Delta {G}_{TS1}<^>{{\ne}}}$ with a change in substituents is primarily governed by electronic factors, but the presence of & UDelta;GTS1 & NOTEQUAL; ${\Delta {G}_{TS1}<^>{{\ne}}}$ itself is due to entropic factors. The rate of the bromination reaction under the studied conditions diminishes with a change in the substituent, R, following the order: R=-OCH3, -CH3, -H, -CCH3CH2, -C6H5, -CH2OH, -F, -SCH2CH3, -Cl, -Br, -COCH3, -COOH, -NC, -COH, and -CN. Indole bromination in depth. The direct bromination reaction of substituted indoles occurs in a two-step reaction mechanism, being the first one, in which the LUMO of Br2 reacts with the HOMO of the indole, the determinant of the reaction rate. The relative electrostatic molecular potential of the substituent and the Gibbs free energy barrier of the reaction rate-determining step follow a linear relationship.image	[Gil, A.

Computational modeling of low-density lipoprotein accumulation at the carotid artery bifurcation after stenting	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						carotid artery stenting; low-density lipoprotein; stent design	CLOSED-CELL STENTS; LDL ACCUMULATION; CORONARY-ARTERY; TRANSPORT; ENDARTERECTOMY; ANGIOPLASTY; SIMULATION; STENOSIS; DESIGN; IMPACT	Restenosis typically occurs in regions of low and oscillating wall shear stress, which also favor the accumulation of atherogenic macromolecules such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This study aims to evaluate LDL transport and accumulation at the carotid artery bifurcation following carotid artery stenting (CAS) by means of computational simulation. The computational model consists of coupled blood flow and LDL transport, with the latter being modeled as a dilute substance dissolved in the blood and transported by the flow through a convection-diffusion transport equation. The endothelial layer was assumed to be permeable to LDL, and the hydraulic conductivity of LDL was shear-dependent. Anatomically realistic geometric models of the carotid bifurcation were built based on pre- and post-stent computed tomography (CT) scans. The influence of stent design was investigated by virtually deploying two different types of stents (open- and closed-cell stents) into the same carotid bifurcation model. Predicted LDL concentrations were compared between the post-stent carotid models and the relatively normal contralateral model reconstructed from patient-specific CT images. Our results show elevated LDL concentration in the distal section of the stent in all post-stent models, where LDL concentration is 20 times higher than that in the contralateral carotid. Compared with the open-cell stents, the closed-cell stents have larger areas exposed to high LDL concentration, suggesting an increased risk of stent restenosis. This computational approach is readily applicable to multiple patient studies and, once fully validated against follow-up data, it can help elucidate the role of stent strut design in the development of in-stent restenosis after CAS. This paper presents a computational study that investigates the impact of stent strut design on LDL transport and accumulation at the stented carotid artery bifurcation, contributing to the prediction of the risk of in-stent restenosis. The wall-free model consists of transient CFD simulations coupled with advection-diffusion equations of LDL. A new approach is adopted to simulate the accumulation of LDL over time by artificially accelerating the wall transport process, allowing simulations of LDL accumulation over thousands of cardiac cycles.

Resident, but not migratory, songbird eye size varies with urban-associated light pollution levels	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						body size; demographics; eye size; phenotypic divergence; sensory pollution; songbirds; urbanization	BODY-SIZE; ISLAND RULE; BIRDS; BIODIVERSITY; NOISE; AGE; EVOLUTION; BEHAVIOR; CITY; COLORATION	Urbanization now exposes large portions of the earth to sources of anthropogenic disturbance, driving rapid environmental change and producing novel environments. Changes in selective pressures as a result of urbanization are often associated with phenotypic divergence; however, the generality of phenotypic change remains unclear. In this study, we examined whether morphological phenotypes in two residential species (Carolina Wren [Thryothorus ludovicianus] and Northern Cardinal [Cardinalis cardinalis]) and two migratory species (Painted Bunting [Passerina ciris], and White-eyed Vireo [Vireo griseus]), differed between urban core and edge habitats in San Antonio, Texas, USA. More specifically, we examined whether urbanization, associated sensory pollution (light and noise) and brightness (open, bright areas cause by anthropogenic land use) influenced measures of avian body (mass and frame size) and lateral eye size. We found no differences in body size between urban core and edge habitats for all species except the Painted Bunting, in which core-urban individuals were smaller. Rather than a direct effect of urbanization, this was due to differences in age structure between habitats, with urban-core areas consisting of higher proportions of younger buntings which are, on average, smaller than older birds. Residential birds inhabiting urban-core areas had smaller eyes compared to their urban-edge counterparts, resulting from a negative association between eye size and light pollution and brightness across study sites; notably, we found no such association in the two migratory species. Our findings demonstrate how urbanization may indirectly influence phenotypes by altering population demographics and highlight the importance of accounting for age when assessing factors driving phenotypic change. We also provide some of the first evidence that birds may adapt to urban environments through changes in their eye morphology, demonstrating the need for future research into relationships among eye size, ambient light microenvironment use, and disassembly of avian communities as a result of urbanization. We examined whether there was evidence for phenotypic divergence in body size and eye size within four species of songbirds breeding across the San Antonio metropolitan area. While we found no evidence of phenotypic divergence in body size, we found differences in eye size (smaller eyes in more urban populations) and a negative association between eye size and measures of light pollution (brightness and artificial light at night) in residential but not migratory songbird species. Our findings highlight the sensory environment as an important selective force driving avian responses to urbanization and avenues for future research.image	[Jones, Todd M.; Llamas, Alfredo P.; Phillips, Jennifer N.] Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, Dept Life Sci, San Antonio, TX 78224 USA; [Jones, Todd M.] Smithsonians Natl Zoo & Conservat Biol Inst, Migratory Bird Ctr, Washington, DC USA; [Jones, Todd M.] Univ Illinois Champaign Urbana, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Champaign, IL USA; [Phillips, Jennifer N.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA USA	Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University San Antonio; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Illinois Natural History Survey; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Washington State University	Jones, TM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ San Antonio, Dept Life Sci, San Antonio, TX 78224 USA.	jonestm@si.edu		Jones, Todd/0000-0002-1658-6531	This research was funded with support from the Life Sciences Department at Texas Aamp;amp;M University-San Antonio, the College of Arts and Sciences, Friends of Government Canyon, and Texas Eco-Lab.

However, the severity of both diseases and the relationship between ETW and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) is unclear.ObjectivesThe prevalence and severity of ETW were investigated in RO, NERD and healthy controls.Methods135 patients with RO, 65 with NERD and 40 healthy controls were recruited for this case-control study. A modified tooth wear index was used to evaluate the prevalence and severity of ETW. Salivary secretion and buffer capacity were assessed prior to endoscopy. The prevalence and severity of ETW, saliva properties among each group were analysed using Pearson's chi-squared test.ResultsA total of 135 cases (56.3%) were categorised as the patient with ETW (55 with mild RO, 49 with severe RO and 31 with NERD). There was a significant relationship between the prevalence of RO and ETW, while there was no significant correlation between the prevalence of NERD and ETW. There was a significant difference related to the severity between RO and ETW. For salivary secretion, there was a significant difference between with and without ETW in patients with mild RO, severe RO and NERD. There was a significant difference between with and without ETW for salivary buffer capacity in patients with mild and severe RO.ConclusionThere was a significant association of the prevalence and severity between RO and ETW. Clinical signs such as ETW and salivary buffer capacity depended on the severity of RO. This study evaluated the prevalence and severity of erosive tooth wear (ETW) in patients with reflux oesophagitis (RO) and non-erosive reflux disease. There was a significant association of the prevalence and severity between RO and ETW. Severe RO showed a higher prevalence of severe ETW than mild RO. The palatal surfaces of the maxillary anterior and occlusal surfaces of premolar and molars were affected by not only chemical factors but also mechanical factors, which may further influence ETW.image	[Kitasako, Yuichi; Tanabe, Tomohide; Koeda, Mai; Momma, Eri; Hoshikawa, Yoshimasa; Hoshino, Shintaro; Kawami, Noriyuki; Iwakiri, Katsuhiko] Nippon Med Sch, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kitasako, Yuichi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Restorat Sci, Cariol & Operat Dent, 5-45 Yushima 1 Chome,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Kitasako, Yuichi] Minist Foreign Affairs, Dent Clin, Tokyo, Japan; [Ikeda, Masaomi] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch, Oral Prosthet Engn, Tokyo, Japan	Nippon Medical School; Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU); Tokyo Medical & Dental University (TMDU)	Kitasako, Y (corresponding author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Restorat Sci, Cariol & Operat Dent, 5-45 Yushima 1 Chome,Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.	kitasako.ope@tmd.ac.jp		Hoshikawa, Yoshimasa/0000-0003-3031-0993; Kitasako, Yuichi/0000-0003-1393-0840	JSPS KAKENHI [JP20K082973, JP21K09889]	JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))	The authors would like to thank Prof. Michael F Burrow for his helpful support of this report.

By performing hydrogen gas permeation, a relationship for Sieverts' law was established, which was used in combination with electrochemical hydrogen permeation to determine the equivalent hydrogen pressure. The results revealed that cathodic protection simulated condition at -1050 mV(Ag/AgCl) was equivalent to a hydrogen pressure of 12.3 bar. The addition of thiourea, a hydrogen recombination poison, and changing the applied potential in the cathodic direction increased the equivalent hydrogen pressure. In this way, an electrochemical charging condition equivalent to a potential hydrogen gas pressure for hydrogen transportation (200 bar) was determined.

J	Li, GX; Li, JK				Li, Guangxu; Li, Junke			EWM: An entropy-based framework for estimating energy consumption of edge servers	ENGINEERING REPORTS			English	Article; Early Access						edge server; energy consumption model; EWM framework; green computing; PMC	POWER-CONSUMPTION; CLOUD; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; COST	In mobile edge computing (MEC), accurately predicting and monitoring the energy consumption of edge servers is a key challenge in achieving green computing. The importance of solving this problem is that it can help optimize the energy usage in data centers and thus reduce the carbon emission of MEC. To this end, we propose an innovative entropy-based power modeling framework called entropy weighted model (EWM). The EWM framework weights and combines classical prediction models by analyzing the major components of a server and selecting appropriate parameters. We validate the performance of EWM using real server power and performance counter data and compare it with other classical prediction models by Friedman test. The results show that EWM outperforms other classical prediction models in all test datasets. This result validates the significant advantages of ourEWMframework in solving the critical problem of edge server power prediction, and provides an effective tool for achieving data center energy optimization and promoting green computing, resulting in a highly general and accurate prediction model.

Anal cancer screening results from 18-to-34-year-old men who have sex with men living with HIV	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article; Early Access						anal cancer; anal intraepithelial neoplasia; human immunodeficiency virus; human papillomavirus; men who have sex with men	SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESIONS; HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; NATURAL-HISTORY; INFECTION; RECOMMENDATIONS; PREVALENCE; PREVENTION; MANAGEMENT; YOUNG	Men who have sex with men living with HIV (MSM LWH) are at highest risk for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anal cancer. There is no consensus on the optimal screening initiation age. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of anal HPV disease among MSM LWH under the age of 35, which is a currently proposed screening age threshold. Between 2014 and 2020, 1255 18-to-34-year-old MSM LWH underwent anal cytology screening. 916 were co-tested for high-risk HPV (HR-HPV). 467 underwent high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and biopsy. Cancer registry data were queried. Predictors of abnormal cytology (ie, & GE;ASCUS) and histological high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) were evaluated using unadjusted logistic regression models. Median age was 28 years (range, 18-34). 19% received at least one dose of HPV vaccine. Abnormal cytology rate was 65%. HR-HPV and HPV16 prevalence were 87% and 30%. Biopsy results were benign (10%), LSIL (43%) and HSIL (47%). No cases of prevalent or incident anal cancers were detected. Findings were similar between age subgroups (18-24, 25-29 and 30-34) except for a higher prevalence of AIN 3 in the 30-34 group (19%). Abnormal cytology was significantly associated with HR-HPV infection. Histological HSIL was associated with HR-HPV infection and cytological LSIL or worse. The absence of anal cancer in a large cohort of MSM LWH under the age of 35, despite high prevalence of anal HR-HPV infection and precancer, supports an age-based anal cancer screening strategy for MSM LWH. Screening for anal human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated precancer among men who have sex with men living with HIV (MSM LWH) can help prevent invasive anal cancer. Debate remains, however, about the optimal age at which screening should begin. This study investigated anal (pre) cancer prevalence in MSM LWH who received anal cytology screening before age 35, with cases of abnormal cytology referred for high resolution anoscopy. The data reveal a high prevalence of anal HPV infection and precancer but no case of invasive anal cancer, even when anal precancer was not treated, supporting the adoption of age-based anal cancer screening for MSM LWH starting at age 35 when anal cancer risk begins to increse.image	[Liu, Yuxin; Bhardwaj, Swati] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pathol, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sigel, Keith; Winters, John; Gaisa, Michael M.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Med, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Terlizzi, Joseph] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Surg, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Liu, Yuxin] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pathol, Mt Sinai Hlth Syst, 1468 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10029 USA	Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai	Liu, YX (corresponding author), Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Dept Pathol, Mt Sinai Hlth Syst, 1468 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10029 USA.	yuxin.liu@mountsinai.org			Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute [R01CA256660]	Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI))	Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Grant/Award Number: R01CA256660		31	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0020-7136	1097-0215		INT J CANCER	Int.

J	Minnerop, P				Minnerop, Petra			Intergenerational Preparedness: Climate Change, Community Interest Obligations and the Environmental Rule of Law	GLOBAL POLICY			English	Article; Early Access							FUTURE GENERATIONS; ATTRIBUTION; TRAGEDY; GOODS	This article argues that the protection of 'community interests' in international law includes intertemporal obligations of States, in cases where it is scientifically foreseeable that preserving the 'status quo' of a protected community interest is increasingly unlikely. The argument is developed for climate change as a 'common concern of humankind' and based on the premise that even if a temperature limitation of 1.5 & DEG;C would be achieved towards the end of this century, future generations will nevertheless live in a world that has fundamentally changed due to current policy and law choices. The article introduces the new concept of 'intergenerational preparedness' to operationalise and expand the normative scope of the principle of intergenerational equity. While some argumentative structures will be examined where intergenerational preparedness can be given effect through legal interpretation, the expectation that States must adopt preparatory measures to account for their community interest obligations deserves a more explicit recognition. It is a matter of the (environmental) rule of law to protect community interests on a time continuum, and this encompasses measures to prevent the deterioration of protected interests and to prepare communities for foreseeable detrimental changes.

However, the association between apathy and tumour removal of gliomas from the frontal lobe remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing post-operative apathy after tumour removal in patients with diffuse frontal gliomas. We compared the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with and without post-operative apathy in a cohort of 54 patients who underwent awake brain mapping for frontal gliomas. The frequency of clinical parameters such as left-sided involvement, high-grade tumour types (WHO grades III, IV), main tumour location in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) and/or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was significantly greater in the apathetic group compared to the non-apathetic group. The apathetic group scored significantly lower on neuropsychological assessments such as the Letter Fluency Test among the Word Fluency Tests than the non-pathetic group (p = .000). Moreover, the scores of Parts 3, and 3-1 of the Stroop test were significantly lower in the apathetic group than those in the non-apathetic group (p = .023, .027, respectively). Multivariate model analysis revealed that the appearance of post-operative apathy was significantly related to side of the of lesion [left vs. right, hazard ratio (HR) = 8.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.36-46.96, p = .021], location of the main tumour in the frontal lobe (ACC/DLPFC/OFC vs. others, HR = 7.99, 95% CI = 2.16-29.59, p = .002), and the Letter Fluency Test (HR = .37, 95% CI = .15-.90, p = .028). Post-operative apathy is significantly associated with ACC and/or DLPFC and OFC in the left hemisphere of diffuse frontal gliomas. Apathy in frontal gliomas is correlated with a decline in the Letter Fluency Test scores. Therefore, this instrument is a potential predictor of post-operative apathy in patients with diffuse frontal gliomas undergoing awake brain mapping.

J	Nieminen, K; Sarasoja, L				Nieminen, Kati; Sarasoja, Laura			Epistemic othering: the interplay of knowledges in legislative drafting	JOURNAL OF LAW AND SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access								In this article, we use the concept of epistemic othering to describe the subjectivation of people who experience debt problems in the legislative drafting process, and argue that the evidence-based policy paradigm, together with its participatory dimension, produce a potentially harmful subject position for people who are considered vulnerable and irrational. By analysing the preparatory material of Finnish interest rate cap laws, we explore what is constructed as rational and possible in the legislative process, and how these modalities frame the use of expert knowledge. We argue that what is considered rational is constructed in terms of market logic, and what is construed as possible is heavily framed by law-as-knowledge. Together, market logic and law-as-knowledge form the preconditions for the use of expert knowledge. Ultimately, the way in which these three types of knowledge interact contributes to the epistemic othering of people who experience debt problems.

Transcriptome analysis of six tissues obtained post-mortem from sepsis patients	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						cell response; immunity; sepsis; transcriptomics	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; CELL-DEATH; TRANSACTIVATION; COAGULATION; DYSFUNCTION; MECHANISMS; PATHWAYS	Septic shock is a life-threatening clinical condition characterized by a robust immune inflammatory response to disseminated infection. Little is known about its impact on the transcriptome of distinct human tissues. To address this, we performed RNA sequencing of samples from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, heart, lung, kidney and colon of seven individuals who succumbed to sepsis and seven uninfected controls. We identified that the lungs and colon were the most affected organs. While gene activation dominated, strong inhibitory signals were also detected, particularly in the lungs. We found that septic shock is an extremely heterogeneous disease, not only when different individuals are investigated, but also when comparing different tissues of the same patient. However, several pathways, such as respiratory electron transport and other metabolic functions, revealed distinctive alterations, providing evidence that tissue specificity is a hallmark of sepsis. Strikingly, we found evident signals of accelerated ageing in our sepsis population.

However, there remains a severe gap in college participation and employment in engineering fields for students with learning disabilities (SWLDs). One potential way to encourage SWLDs to consider engineering as a profession and promote the development of key science attitudes may be through engineering and technology career and technical education (E-CTE) coursework. In this study, we address the following research questions: Do SWLDs take E-CTE courses in the early years of high school at different rates compared to students without learning disabilities? What is the relationship between early E-CTE coursetaking and science attitudes (self-efficacy, utility, identity), and does this differ for students with and without learning disabilities? How do specific engineering career expectations change with respect to enrollment in early E-CTE coursework, and do these differ for students with and without learning disabilities? We utilize the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS) to respond to the research questions through moderation models and a student fixed effects methodology. Ultimately, we found no evidence of SWLD underrepresentation in E-CTE in high school. However, SWLDs were expected to benefit more than the general population from E-CTE participation with respect to higher levels of science self-efficacy and science identity. Implications from these findings include how to encourage persistence along the engineering pathway, the growth of career pathway policies at the state level, and how to incorporate E-CTE practices in academic courses.

Due to the accessibility of the Haspin crystal structure and its prevalence in various diseases; we sought exploring novel Haspin kinase inhibitors. We used the commercially available Chembridge library for virtual screening which had nearly 7,00,000 compounds. We employed variety of computational tools such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, in silico pharmacokinetics analysis to identify novel inhibitors targeting Haspin kinase. Based on chemical features, docking score, and MMGB/SA binding strength, 10 ligands were chosen. On in vitro determination, one chemical entity was found to inhibit Haspin's enzyme function at 72% at 10 mu M. Compound 16503395 had higher selectivity over Haspin kinase activity than the other kinases. The IC50 value for the compound 16503395 that inhibits Haspin kinase significantly was determined and was found to be 2.6 mu M. After subjecting to molecular dynamics simulation analysis for compound 16503395 Haspin protein complex, we found that the Haspin kinase binding site amino acid unique residues Gly608, Glu492, Lys511, Asn654, Asp687, Ala503, Leu656 and Phe605 play important role in binding kinetics. We claim 5-(hydroxymethyl)-N-[cis-3-(6-oxo-2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-4-yl)cyclobutyl]-2-furamide (16503395) as a selective and potential Haspin kinase inhibitor.

The clinical presentation is highly variable, with a spectrum ranging from recurrent bacterial and opportunistic infections to concomitant autoimmune diseases and, sometimes malignant pathologies. Due to heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and the lack of adequate diagnostic criteria, its recognition is often challenging, even delaying it by years. It is one of the most unusual, less studied form of the immune deficiency syndromes with a still unknown pathophysiology. It was initially considered a thymoma-associated variant of primary antibody deficiencies with a reduced or absent number of mature B cells, but it later emerged that significant defects of T cell-mediated immune functions are the underlying cause of opportunistic infections. On the basis of current evidence, Good's syndrome is evaluated as a distinct acquired form of combined immunodeficiency states and classified as a phenocopy of primary immunodeficiency diseases. Epigenetic and acquired genetic factors can play an ultimate role in its evolution.

Herein, we examine two decades of enforcement records pertaining to Atlantic salmon from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Illegal incidents were negatively correlated with the number of licensed anglers but not salmon abundance. Over two decades, illegal incidents declined by 66%, even after correcting for the positive relationship between enforcement effort and illegal incidents. This decline was primarily driven by a 67% reduction in netting and jigging-related violations, which were likely to impose the highest levels of mortality on adult salmon among violations examined. Additionally, illegal incidents and violation types did not increase as a result of management changes. While Newfoundland and Labrador remains one of the last strongholds for Atlantic salmon, we encourage other jurisdictions to monitor fisheries compliance to better understand the social-ecological landscape that is crucial to supporting healthy fisheries.

We investigated the spread of the invasive yellow monkeyflower, Erythranthe gutatta in New Zealand, where it is spreading from lowland agricultural land into high-elevation conservation areas. We investigated the extent of phenotypic variation among clones from across the South Island, looked for adaptation and compared degrees of plasticity among lowland core versus montane range-edge populations. We grew 34 clones and measured their vegetative and floral traits in two common gardens, one in the core range at 9 m a.s.l. and one near the range-edge at 560 m a.s.l. Observed trait variation was explained by a combination of genotypic diversity (as identified through common gardens) and high phenotypic plasticity. We found a subtle signature of local adaptation to lowland habitats but all clones were plastic and able to survive and reproduce in both gardens. In the range-edge garden, above-ground biomass was on average almost double and stolon length almost half that of the same clone in the core garden. Clones from low-elevation sites showed higher plasticity on average than those from higher elevation sites. The highest performing clones in the core garden were also top performers in the range-edge garden. These results suggest some highly fit general-purpose genotypes, possibly pre-adapted to New Zealand montane conditions, best explains the spread of E. gutatta from lowland to higher elevation areas.

Three groups of 25 interpreter trainees at Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran took part in the study, all groups receiving the same amount of instruction (10 h over 5 weeks). The control group listened to/viewed authentic audio recordings and movies in English, discussed their contents, and completed a variety of listening comprehension tasks but received no prosody instruction. The first experimental group spent part of the time on theoretical explanation of, and practical exercises with, English prosody by an instructor by providing FB when teaching prosody while the second experimental group was provided FF when teaching prosody. Versions of Longman's Test of English as a Foreign Language English proficiency test (paper-based) were used to assess listening comprehension at pretest, immediate posttest and delayed posttest. The findings revealed that the prosody instruction by providing FB enhanced the listening comprehension skills of the interpreter trainees more than by providing FF. The practical implications of the study would be that in the given circumstances where only limited curricular time is available for instruction and practice, a judicious choice can be made to lend priority to providing FB in prosody instruction for developing listening comprehension skills by interpreter trainees rather than to the providing FF. Few studies have examined the extent to which targeted instruction may help L2 students to take advantage of the subtle meanings communicated through prosodic features. The present study shows that prosody instruction by providing feedback enhances the listening comprehension skills of the interpreter trainees more than by providing feedforward.

As a result, despite high incidence of donor site complications, radial forearm flap is still commonly used for tongue, buccal mucosa and lip defects where a traditional ALT flap would be too bulky. The objective of this report was to evaluate the usefulness of super-thin ALT flap as an alternative to radial forearm flap for intra-oral reconstruction.Patients and methodsRetrospective evaluation was done of all head and neck reconstructions performed by a single surgeon between December 2021 and May 2022. Twenty-two patients who had undergone super-thin ALT flaps for intra-oral reconstruction of soft tissue defects were included in the report. These included buccal mucosa (n = 11), tongue (n = 8), and buccal mucosa with neck skin defects (n = 3). All patients had undergone wide excision of oral squamous cell carcinoma, and had history of chewing tobacco. Average age of patients was 54 years, 16 were males and 6 were females. Mean BMI of the patients was 25.2 kg/m2 (Range: 20.5-31.0 kg/m2). Super-thin ALT flap was elevated in the plane of superficial fascia of the thigh, thus leaving behind the deeper fat. The flaps were shaped as per the measurements obtained from the specimen as well as the defect and intra-oral inset was done prior to vascular anastomosis.ResultsMean flap dimension was 8.3 x 6.7 cm (range: 6 x 5 to 20 x 7 cm). Mean flap thickness was 9 mm (range: 4-20 mm). Mean flap elevation time was 70.9 min (Range: 48-105 min). None of the flaps needed a re-exploration. All flaps survived completely. One patient had surgical site infection at the flap donor site which was managed conservatively. Mean follow up was 5 months (range: 3-10 months). All patients were able to take soft oral diet at the last follow up.ConclusionsSuper-thin ALT flaps raised in superficial fascia plane are reliable and provide thin, pliable tissue for head and neck reconstruction. Unlike other thin flaps, these are not limited by donor site morbidity and flap dimension.

Approximately 50% of people with diabetes and a foot ulcer have peripheral artery disease (PAD) and the presence of PAD significantly increases the risk of adverse limb and cardiovascular events. The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence based guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetes related foot complications since 1999. This guideline is an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline on the diagnosis, prognosis and management of peripheral artery disease in people with diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer. For this guideline the IWGDF, the European Society for Vascular Surgery and the Society for Vascular Surgery decided to collaborate to develop a consistent suite of recommendations relevant to clinicians in all countries. This guideline is based on three new systematic reviews. Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework clinically relevant questions were formulated, and the literature was systematically reviewed. After assessing the certainty of the evidence, recommendations were formulated which were weighed against the balance of benefits and harms, patient values, feasibility, acceptability, equity, resources required, and when available, costs. Through this process five recommendations were developed for diagnosing PAD in a person with diabetes, with and without a foot ulcer or gangrene. Five recommendations were developed for prognosis relating to estimating likelihood of healing and amputation outcomes in a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene. Fifteen recommendations were developed related to PAD treatment encompassing prioritisation of people for revascularisation, the choice of a procedure and post-surgical care. In addition, the Writing Committee has highlighted key research questions where current evidence is lacking. The Writing Committee believes that following these recommendations will help healthcare professionals to provide better care and will reduce the burden of diabetes related foot complications.

Thus, the mechanical structure and motion control of the RCM manipulator play important roles.MethodsA multi-objective genetic algorithm was exploited to maximise the kinematic performance and obtain a compact structure of the RCM manipulator. An inverse kinematic solution method is proposed to meet task accuracy and kinematic singularity avoidance constraints for safety motion control.ResultsSimulation results demonstrate that there are significant improvements in the reachable workspace inside the abdominal cavity, the flexibility of the workspace, kinematic performance, and compactness of the RCM manipulator. Experiments verify the feasibility of the prototype and the validity of the proposed inverse kinematic solution method.ConclusionsThis enhances the adaptability and safety of the RCM manipulator and provides potential prospects for MIS application.

However, a subset of cases follow an aggressive disease course with progression to metastasis and death. Several histopathological parameters are associated with poor outcomes, but lymphovascular invasion (LVI) has not been well studied. Objective: To assess the prognostic significance of LVI in cSCC and determine associations between LVI and cSCC. Methods: A retrospective review of 486 consecutive cases of cSCC over a 5-year period from a single centre was stratified by the presence or absence of LVI. Logistic regression and multivariate survival analysis were used to determine associations of LVI and prognostic significance of LVI, respectively. Findings: LVI was present in 41 cases (9.2%). LVI was significantly associated with increasing depth of invasion, microanatomical tumour location (subcutis vs. dermis), and tumour dimensions (P < 0.05). Univariate survival analysis revealed significantly lower 2-year overall survival rates for patients with LVI (37.1%) compared with those without (66.6%) (95% CI = 60.6-73.3, P < 0.001). LVI was also found to be an independent marker of poor disease-specific survival (HR = 0.232 (95% CI = 0.090-0.600), P = 0.003), poor overall survival (HR 0.338 (95% CI = 0.184-0.623), P < 0.001) and poor disease-free survival (HR 0.461 (95% CI = 0.230-0.923), P = 0.029) through multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This study confirms that LVI is an independent poor prognosticator in cSCC, with significantly worse survival indices at 2 years. Future systems of risk stratification for cSCC should incorporate LVI.

While the extraction of DNA, RNA and proteins from a single sample allows for both determination of genetic type and analysis of gene expression, whole mount analysis is not possible. In this study, we explored the applicability of PCR using extraembryonic tissues, especially the decidual side tissue after isolating the embryos from implantation sites to establish a method for determining the genetic type of embryos. The implantation site was resected at each day from the date of vaginal plug confirmation, separated into embryos and deciduae. Genomic DNA were isolated separately from the embryos and the deciduae. PCR was performed using these genomic DNA, and the band patterns were compared after electrophoresis. As a result, we demonstrated that detecting embryo-derived cells in the decidua allows determination of the sex and presence of transgenes without harming the mouse embryos themselves, from 8.5 days of age. This method enables the determination of the genetic type of mouse embryos without damaging. This technique would expand the adaptations for analysis of mouse implanted embryos.

Objectives: The study was designed to determine the harmful effects of 4G mobile phone radiation on the expression of immunogenic and vascular genes and gross, microscopic and biochemical alterations in the development of chicken embryos. Methods: Sixty individuals in the exposure group were subjected to mobile phones with a specific absorption rate of 1.4W/kg and a frequency of 2100 MHz positioned at a distance of 12 cm in the incubator for 60 min/night for 14 days. The histopathological examination involved hematoxylin and eosin staining, whereas cresyl violet staining was used to evaluate the condition and number of neurons in the brain. The biochemical parameters of amniotic fluid were analysed using the photometry method, and the expression of VEGF-A and immunity genes (AvBD9, IL6) was measured using the real-time PCR (qPCR) technique. Results: Compared to the control, the exposure group's body weight and length significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Subcutaneous bleeding was seen in the exposure group. Urea, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were all significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). The exposed group showed pathological lesions in the liver and degenerated neurons with lightly stained nuclei in the cerebral cortex. Hyperchromatic neurons were significantly higher in the exposure group (58.8 +/- 2.28) compared to the control (6.6 +/- 0.44) (p < 0.05). 4G exposure reduced lymphocyte count in the caecal tonsil (86.8 +/- 5.38) compared to the control (147.2 +/- 9.06) (p < 0.05). Vascular gene mRNA expression was higher, but immune gene expression was lower in the exposed group. Conclusion: Exposure to mobile phone radiation may result in gross, microscopic and biochemical changes, as well as alterations in gene expression that could hinder embryonic development.	[Islam, Md.

Novel circular RNAs of the apoptosis-related <i>BAX</i> and <i>BCL2L12</i> genes identified in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell line using nanopore sequencing	FEBS OPEN BIO			English	Article; Early Access						BCL2 family; circRNA; pro-apoptotic; single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization; third generation (long-read) sequencing; transcriptomics	DATABASE; FAMILY	Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel RNA type generated by back-splicing, are key regulators of gene expression, with deregulated expression and established involvement in leukemia. The products of BCL2 and its homologs, including BAX and BCL2L12, are implicated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, to the best of our knowledge, nothing is known about circRNAs produced by these two genes and their role in CLL. We sought to further elucidate the contribution of BAX and BCL2L12 in CLL by unraveling the identity, localization, and potential role of their circRNAs. Therefore, total RNA from the EHEB cell line and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CLL patients and non-leukemic blood donors was extracted and reverse-transcribed using random hexamers. Next, nested PCRs with divergent primers were performed and the purified PCR products were subjected to 3rd generation nanopore sequencing. Nested PCRs were also applied to first-strand cDNAs synthesized from total RNA extracts of PBMCs from CLL patients and non-leukemic blood donors. Lastly, a single-molecule resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization method called circFISH was used to visualize the circRNA distribution in EHEB cells. We discovered several novel circRNAs produced by BAX and BCL2L12, which were characterized by great exon structure diversity. In addition, intriguing findings regarding their formation emerged. Interestingly, visualization of the most abundant circRNAs showed distinct intracellular localization. Moreover, a complex BAX and BCL2L12 circRNA expression pattern was revealed in CLL patients and non-leukemic blood donors. Our data suggest a multifaceted role of BAX and BCL2L12 circRNAs in B-cell CLL.

Life-stage specificity and cross-generational climate effects on the microbiome of a tropical sea urchin (Echinodermata: Echinoidea)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; coral reefs; development; microbe; sea urchin; transgenerational acclimatization	BACTERIAL COMMUNITY DYNAMICS; OCEAN; ACIDIFICATION	Microbes play a critical role in the development and health of marine invertebrates, though microbial dynamics across life stages and host generations remain poorly understood in most reef species, especially in the context of climate change. Here, we use a 4-year multigenerational experiment to explore microbe-host interactions under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-forecast climate scenarios in the rock-boring tropical urchin Echinometra sp. A. Adult urchins (F0) were exposed for 18 months to increased temperature and pCO2 levels predicted for years 2050 and 2100 under RCP 8.5, a period which encompassed spawning. After rearing F1 offspring for a further 2 years, spawning was induced, and F2 larvae were raised under current day and 2100 conditions. Cross-generational climate effects were also explored in the microbiome of F1 offspring through a transplant experiment. Using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we determined that each life stage and generation was associated with a distinct microbiome, with higher microbial diversity observed in juveniles compared to larval stages. Although life-stage specificity was conserved under climate conditions projected for 2050 and 2100, we observed changes in the urchin microbial community structure within life stages. Furthermore, we detected a climate-mediated parental effect when juveniles were transplanted among climate treatments, with the parental climate treatment influencing the offspring microbiome. Our findings reveal a potential for cross-generational impacts of climate change on the microbiome of a tropical invertebrate species.

However, the relationship between BPE levels and breast cancer risk stratification remains unclear.Purpose: To evaluate the clinical relationship between BPE levels and breast cancer risk with covariate adjustments for age, ethnicity, and hormonal status.Study TypeRetrospective.Population: 954 screening breast MRI datasets representing 721 women divided into four cohorts: women with pathogenic germline breast cancer (BRCA) mutations (Group 1, N = 211), women with non-BRCA germline mutations (Group 2, N = 60), women without high-risk germline mutations but with a lifetime breast cancer risk of & GE;20% using the Tyrer-Cuzick model (Group 3, N = 362), and women with <20% lifetime risk (Group 4, N = 88).Field Strength/Sequence3 T/axial non-fat-saturated T1, short tau inversion recovery, fat-saturated pre-contrast, and post-contrast T1-weighted images.Assessment: Data on age, body mass index, ethnicity, menopausal status, genetic predisposition, and hormonal therapy use were collected. BPE levels were evaluated by two breast fellowship-trained radiologists independently in accordance with BI-RADS, with a third breast fellowship-trained radiologist resolving any discordance.Statistical Tests: Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to adjust covariates, including age, ethnicity, menopausal status, hormonal treatments, and prior bilateral oophorectomy. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, and univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed, with an odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval. Weighted Kappa statistic was used to assess inter-reader variation. A P value <0.05 indicated a significant result.Results: In the assessment of BPE, there was substantial agreement between the two interpreting radiologists (? = 0.74). Patient demographics were not significantly different between patient groups after PSM. The BPE of Group 1 was significantly lower than that of Group 4 and Group 3 among premenopausal women. In estimating the BPE level, the OR of gene mutations was 0.35.Data Conclusion: Adjusting for potential confounders, the BPE level of premenopausal women with BRCA mutations was significantly lower than that of non-high-risk women.Level of Evidence3Technical EfficacyStage 3	[Murakami, Wakana] Showa Univ, Sch Med, 1-5-8 Hatanodai,Shinagawa Ku, Tokyo 1428555, Japan; [Murakami, Wakana; Mortazavi, Shabnam; Yu, Tiffany; Yan, Ran; Fischer, Cheryce; Lee-Felker, Stephanie] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Radiol Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Murakami, Wakana] Showa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kathuria-Prakash, Nikhita; McCann, Kelly E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, David Geffen Sch Med, Dept Med, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Yan, Ran] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Bioengn, Los Angeles, CA USA	Showa University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Showa University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California Los Angeles Medical Center; David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles	Murakami, W (corresponding author), Showa Univ, Sch Med, 1-5-8 Hatanodai,Shinagawa Ku, Tokyo 1428555, Japan.	wkn.murakami@gmail.com		Yan, Ran/0000-0001-8204-8654; Murakami, Wakana/0000-0002-7956-6052; Sung, KyungHyun/0000-0003-4175-5322	This work was supported in part by the Tanner Project Foundation.

Ten-year work burden after prostate cancer treatment	CANCER MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						disease management; prostate cancer; racial groups; work burden	FINANCIAL TOXICITY; HEALTH-CARE	IntroductionWe aim to characterize the magnitude of the work burden (weeks off from work) associated with prostate cancer (PCa) treatment over a 10-year period after PCa diagnosis and identify those at greatest risk.Materials and MethodsWe identified men diagnosed with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or active surveillance/watchful waiting within CaPSURE. Patients self-reported work burden and SF36 general health scores via surveys before and 1,3,5, and 10 years after treatment. Using multivariate repeated measures generalized estimating equation modeling we examined the association between primary treatment with risk of any work weeks lost due to care.ResultsIn total, 6693 men were included. The majority were White (81%, 5% Black, and 14% Other) with CAPRA low- (60%) or intermediate-risk (32%) disease and underwent surgery (62%) compared to 29% radiation and 9% active surveillance. Compared to other treatments, surgical patients were more likely to report greater than 7 days off work in the first year, with relatively less time off over time. Black men (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.77) and those undergoing radiation (vs. surgery, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.41-0.51) were less likely to report time off from work over time. Mean baseline GH score (73 [SD 18]) was similar between race and treatment groups, and stable over time.ConclusionsThe work burden of cancer care continued up to 10 years after treatment and varied across racial groups and primary treatment groups, highlighting the multifactorial nature of this issue and the call to leverage greater resources for those at greatest risk. Within this longitudinal study of 6693 men treated for prostate cancer, time take off from work due to PCa treatment persisted up to 10 years after primary treatment. The long-term impact of PCa treatment was not limited only to those with paid jobs and was found to also effect one's usual activities/responsibilities and general health of all men with PCa.image	[Washington III, Samuel L.; Cowan, Janet E.; Zhao, Shoujun; Palmer, Nynikka R.; Hicks, Cameron; Cooperberg, Matthew R.; Carroll, Peter R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Helen Diller Family Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Washington III, Samuel L.; Cooperberg, Matthew R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Lonergan, Peter E.] St James Hosp, Dept Urol, Dublin, Ireland; [Lonergan, Peter E.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Dublin, Ireland; [Broering, Jeanette M.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Surg, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Palmer, Nynikka R.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Palmer, Nynikka R.] Zuckerberg San Francisco Gen Hosp, Div Gen Internal Med, San Francisco, CA USA; [Washington III, Samuel L.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Urol, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA	University of California System; University of California San Francisco; UCSF Medical Center; UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of California System; University of California San Francisco	Washington, SL III (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Urol, 550 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.	samuel.washington@ucsf.edu	Washington, Samuel/X-7049-2019	Washington, Samuel/0000-0002-2467-6115	We would like to thank Scott Greenberg MD, Alexander Bell MD, and Robert Parker MD for their assistance with this project.

Even minor adjustments in the synthesis of Cu clusters can easily lead to great changes in their cluster nuclei. In this work, we have successfully utilized triple collaborative ligands to obtain a pair of infinitely extended Cu-12 cluster-based chains (Cu-12-1 and Cu-12-2). They have identical Cu-12 metal core structures but slightly different coordinated ligands. Both Cu-12-1 and Cu-12-2 show excellent thermal and ambient stability. However, they exhibit diverse room-temperature photoluminescence phenomena. Crystalline Cu-12-2 displays red-shifted photoluminescence (637 nm) compared with Cu-12-1 (624 nm) due to the relatively smaller LUMO-HOMO gap caused by the substituent effect of electro-withdrawing F atoms. Meanwhile, the substituent effect has influences on electronic structures and electrostatic potentials, thus leading to differences in photoluminescence intensity, PLQY, and lifetime. Crystalline Cu-12-1 displays more intense room-temperature photoluminescence, higher PLQY and longer lifetime. This work provides a valuable approach for how to prepare highly stable Cu clusters and precisely control their structures to regulate their properties.

Employing resource dependence theory as our frame and drawing on qualitative data from 41 interviews with board directors of publicly traded and privately held companies in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we identify three key mechanisms underpinning the achievement of ESG goals, namely, the leveraging of particular connections, the deployment of different resources, and the harnessing of a range of diversity types. We find that the use of social resources is often related to environmental concerns and occasionally social goals, but rarely governance issues. We also find that financial motivations often drive environmental issues, while many of the social resources that added value occurred in the public sector. Importantly, the combining of both skill and social resources, rather than relying on each alone, was seen to increase the likelihood of achieving ESG goals. Our findings also point to the importance of board diversity in accomplishing the board's ESG goals, most especially functional diversity. We propose that such functional diversity, along with resources in the form of social resources and skills, needs to feature more prominently in order to improve ESG performance and outcomes. We highlight the implications of our work, especially regarding the establishment of board diversity policies beyond gender alone.

In this work, we unravel computational indicators using density functional theory to screen and study the stability of P in experimentally-reported cases. These indicators are Gibbs energies, geometrical parameters such as distances and angles, independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) generated data, orbitals' overlap, and distortion-interaction (DI) energies. Our DFT computed Gibbs energies indicate that P is stable in case of PhCO2- and TsO-. CF3SO3- allows P and its isoelectronic species bis-mu-oxo-dicopper (O) to coexist. SbF6- shows that O is in excess. Our indicators reveal that the stability of P in case of PhCO2 and TsO is due to the better placing of P and its CA, thus leading to better interactions and overlap of orbitals. Other indicator displays that the plane of Cu2O2 core in P is more bend in PhCO2 and TsO cases as compared to the plane in the other two cases. In addition, the IGMH-based indicator displays higher values in the case of PhCO2 and TsO than the other CAs.

To date, we have limited understanding of how discrete SP characteristics (i.e., specificity, frequency, and intent to act) present among adolescents, and whether they relate to SB. In the current study, we investigated SP characteristics and their association with SB history among adolescents who had previously considered suicide.MethodsParticipants were 142 community-based adolescents (14-19 years; M = 17.6, SD = 1.4) who reported a history of suicidal ideation. Adolescents provided responses pertaining to their SP history, SP characteristics, and SB history, via the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview-Revised (SITBI-R).ResultsGreater specificity, frequency, and intent were each associated with modestly increased odds of reporting an SB history. The associations between plan specificity and SB history, as well as between frequency of thinking about one's SP and SB history, were mediated by adolescents' intent to act on their SP.ConclusionsIt may not only be whether, but how, adolescents plan for suicide that relates to their tendency to engage in SB.

Exploiting a natural experiment in the mid-20th century U.S. Upper Midwest, we find that social network expansions, in the form of mergers between congregations of the American Lutheran Church, led to increased rates of agricultural technology adoption among farmers. In counties that experienced a merger, the number of farms using chemical fertilizer increased by over 5%, and the total fertilized acreage increased by over 10% relative to counties without a merger. These effects are consistent with increased information sharing between farmers due to congregational mergers.

Do not be salty: an analysis of consumers&apos; salt reduction strategies investigated using word association tasks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							PROCESSED MEAT-PRODUCTS; FOOD-PRODUCTS; PERCEPTION; SODIUM; HEALTH; WILLINGNESS; INFORMATION; ACCEPTANCE; AWARENESS; RESPONSES	Obesity and obesity-related illness have become an increasingly prevalent problem in Canada and around the globe. Due to this situation, consumers' attitudes towards salt use have changed. The objective of this study was to investigate individuals' attitudes towards salt use and identify if they are choosing to reduce salt in their diet using unrestrictive questions. A convenience sample of 193 participants, residing in Atlantic Canada were recruited. Word association tasks were used to identify their attitudes towards salt-reduced foods and high-salt food products. Furthermore, an open-ended comment question was used to identify consumers' salt reduction strategies. Participants considered salt-reduced foods to be healthy and specifically indicated that they help to reduce blood pressure. However, they also considered them to be bland and lack flavour. The participants identified that they believed processed foods to be high in salt, especially processed meats. The majority of participants (70% of the overall population; 89% of older adults above 65 years of age) said they are trying to reduce their salt intake. The most frequently mentioned strategies for reducing salt and sodium intake were making homemade meals, purchasing low-salt and sodium-labelled foods, reading nutrition fact labels and removing saltshakers from their table at home. A sample of 193 participants in Atlantic Canada were asked about their attitudes towards salt in food products.image	[Dabas, Tanvi; Gorman, Mackenzie; Leblanc, Jeanne; Moss, Rachael; Mcsweeney, Matthew B.] Acadia Univ, Sch Nutr & Dietet, Wolfville, NS, Canada	Acadia University	Mcsweeney, MB (corresponding author), Acadia Univ, Sch Nutr & Dietet, Wolfville, NS, Canada.	matthew.mcsweeney@acadiau.ca			Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Development Grant [DDG-2021-00008]; Harrison McCain Foundation Emerging Scholar	Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Development Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Harrison McCain Foundation Emerging Scholar	This research was funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Development Grant (DDG-2021-00008) and Harrison McCain Foundation Emerging Scholar.

J	Darandari, E; Khayat, S				Darandari, Eqbal; Khayat, Shatha			Psychometric properties of the Cultural Intelligence Scale based on item response theory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SELECTION AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article; Early Access						CFA; Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS); EFA; GRM; IRT; PA; psychometric properties	4-FACTOR MODEL; FIT INDEXES; NUMBER; VERSION	The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS), based on item response theory (IRT) using the graded response model (GRM). The study calibration sample included 400, while the study sample included 1000, male and female Saudi participants, aged between 18 and 62 years. IRT-GRM results supported the quality of the psychometric properties of CQS, and its appropriateness to measure cultural intelligence (CQ) for the majority of individuals. CQS well-distinguished people at different ability levels along the CQ latent trait, particularly with middle and low abilities. However, CQS full scale and subscales had less accurate measurement precision at high levels of CQ, and some subscales had more precision at low level abilities. CQS items had medium ability to differentiate among subjects, and they provided more information in evaluating individuals with medium CQ. Therefore, CQS might be more suitable for identification and development purposes, where low to med-levels of CQ are expected. Additional assessment procedures need to be added, for selection or promotion purposes to increase the measurement precision. Confirmatory factor analysis results confirmed the multidimensional construct of CQS with four specific-related factors at the first level, and an aggregate factor at the second level. This model provided better model fit using IRT-GRM approach, and it was supported by classical test theory analysis results. Therefore, it is important to rely on subscale scores, besides the total score to interpret CQ for individuals. The study stressed the importance of examining CQS item parameters and information based on the country it is adapted for, to investigate how they interact with country culture; and to take into account ability level, when selecting optimal measures. The results of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and item response theory (IRT) graded response model (GRM) supported the multidimensional construct of Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS) with four specific-related factors at the first level, and an aggregate factor at the second level, that was proposed by the CQS theory, compared to other models.IRT-GRM analysis results in this study indicated that CQS has good psychometric properties and indicated that it appears to be a valid and moderately reliable instrument in detecting Cultural intelligence (CQ). These results were supported by CTT analysis results.IRT-GRM analysis results showed that CQS well-distinguished people at different ability levels along the CQ latent trait, particularly with middle and low abilities. However, CQS full scale and subscales had less accurate measurement precision at high levels of CQ, and some subscales had more precision at low level abilities.The study suggested that it is important to examine the CQS model fit, item parameters, information functions for the full scale and subscales based on the country it is adapted for, before considering it. It is important also to rely on the subscale scores to interpret CQ for individuals, and to identify their strengths, rather than relying on the total score alone.The study results suggested that CQS suites better CQ identification and development purposes. For selection or promotion purposes, it is suggested to add additional assessment procedures to increase the measurement precision.

Based on Constrained Clustering and corroborated by Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), four statistically significant intervals are identified. Interval 1 (lower-middle part of CF5 Zone) is marked by a warm, oligotrophic, stable, and well-stratified upper water column. Interval 2 (upper part of CF5 Zone), here designated as the pre-Mid-Maastrichtian Event (MME) event, is marked by stressed, warmer, moderately mesotrophic, and weakly stratified surface waters with an unstable upper water column. Interval 3 (CF4 Zone) encompasses the MME and is marked by warm, stable, mesotrophic surface waters with a moderately well-stratified upper water column. The upper part of Interval 3, designated as post-MME, is also marked by mesotrophic conditions, but with increased surface water warming, unstable and stressed conditions. Interval 4 (CF3-CF1 zones) shows the effects of the Indian Deccan volcanism, and is marked by warmer surface waters, mesotrophic, unstable, stressed environmental conditions, with a weakly-stratified upper water column.

Therefore, understanding factors associated with a GPP diagnosis is essential for early diagnosis of GPP in patients with PsV. This retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify associated factors for GPP diagnosis in patients with PsV. Eligible patients with two confirmed diagnoses of PsV with/without a confirmed GPP diagnosis (International Classification of Disease 10th revision codes L40.0 and L40.1, respectively) were identified from the Japanese Medical Data Center database (JMDC) (July 1, 2005-January 31, 2019). Weighted logistic regression was used to identify associated factors (based on recorded comorbidities) between the PsV only and PsV with GPP cohorts. Odds ratios (ORs) of =1.5, associated with a high probability of a GPP diagnosis, were reported for factors with =5 patients/cohort. The time from event to GPP diagnosis was evaluated. The highest associated factor for GPP diagnosis was psoriatic arthritis (OR 20.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.06-23.92, P < 0.0001), which also had the shortest time from event to GPP diagnosis (median 119 days). Other comorbidities associated with GPP diagnosis were other psoriasis, tonsillitis, and sinusitis. Treatments associated with GPP diagnosis included systemic corticosteroids (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.98-2.43, P < 0.0001; median time from treatment initiation to GPP diagnosis 180 days). Other associated treatments (other immunosuppressants, interleukin [IL]-17 or IL-23 inhibitors, and phototherapy) had a delay of =1 year from treatment initiation to GPP diagnosis. Back pain, headache, and fever were also identified as associated with a GPP diagnosis. Patients with PsV requiring systemic therapies are more likely to receive a GPP diagnosis than those not requiring systemic treatment. These data will help identify patients with PsV at high risk of developing GPP and potentially support early GPP diagnosis.

J	Li, FH; Ma, Z; Cai, YJ; Zhou, JW; Liu, RP				Li, Fanghong; Ma, Zhi; Cai, Yajie; Zhou, Jingwei; Liu, Runping			Optimizing diabetic kidney disease animal models: Insights from a meta-analytic approach	ANIMAL MODELS AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Review; Early Access						animal model; diabetic kidney diseases; meta-analysis	HIGH-FAT DIET; RAT MODEL; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PREVENTS NEPHROPATHY; PODOCYTE INJURY; MOUSE MODELS; ALBUMINURIA; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION; ATTENUATE	Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a prevalent complication of diabetes, often leading to end-stage renal disease. Animal models have been widely used to study the pathogenesis of DKD and evaluate potential therapies. However, current animal models often fail to fully capture the pathological characteristics of renal injury observed in clinical patients with DKD. Additionally, modeling DKD is often a time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive process. The current review aims to summarize modeling strategies in the establishment of DKD animal models by utilizing meta-analysis related methods and to aid in the optimization of these models for future research. A total of 1215 articles were retrieved with the keywords of "diabetic kidney disease" and "animal experiment" in the past 10 years. Following screening, 84 articles were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Review manager 5.4.1 was employed to analyze the changes in blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinary albumin excretion rate in each model. Renal lesions shown in different models that were not suitable to be included in the meta-analysis were also extensively discussed. The above analysis suggested that combining various stimuli or introducing additional renal injuries to current models would be a promising avenue to overcome existing challenges and limitations. In conclusion, our review article provides an in-depth analysis of the limitations in current DKD animal models and proposes strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of these models that will inspire future research efforts in the DKD research field. In this paper, 84 studies were found using the keywords "diabetic kidney disease" and "animal model" in the Pubmed database. Then the diabetic metabolic indicators and renal function indicators in the articles were collected for meta-analysis. Combined with the renal lesions and modeling information, the conclusion of optimizing animal models by integrating various stimuli was reached.image	[Li, Fanghong; Cai, Yajie; Liu, Runping] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Chinese Mat Med, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Zhi] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jingwei] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dongzhimen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jingwei] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongzhimen Hosp, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Nephrol, 5 Haiyuncang, Beijing 100007, Peoples R China; [Liu, Runping] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Chinese Mat Med, 11 Bei San Huan Dong Rd, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China	Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine	Zhou, JW (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongzhimen Hosp, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Nephrol, 5 Haiyuncang, Beijing 100007, Peoples R China.; Liu, RP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Chinese Mat Med, 11 Bei San Huan Dong Rd, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.	13910634708@163.com; liurunping@bucm.edu.cn			Beijing Natural Science Foundation [7232294]	Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation)	Beijing Natural Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: 7232294		105	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2096-5451	2576-2095		ANIM MODEL EXP MED	Anim.

However, patients with aseptic loosening often suffer severe bone loss, which poses a great challenge in following revision. Under this situation, a standard stemmed endoprosthesis is unavailable for revision limb salvage. Computer-aided design and 3D-printed personalized implants are an emerging solution for reconstructing complex bone defects.Case Presentation Here, we present a 67-year-old male who underwent PHER after tumor resection and developed aseptic loosening with severe periprosthetic osteolysis around the stem. Computer-aided design and 3D-printed personalized stem-plate composite was used for the precision revision of this patient. During the follow-up, encouraging results were observed, with good endoprosthetic stability and satisfactory limb function.Conclusion Computer-aid design and 3D-printed personalized stem-plate composite used in the present case could help to achieve good endoprosthetic stability and satisfactory limb function. This 3D-printed personalized stem-plate composite seems to be an effective method for the precise revision of PHER in patients with severe periprosthetic osteolysis. In addition, it also provides a novel method for similar revision surgery of other joints or primary endoprosthetic replacement with severe bone defects.

Characterization of the former by structural and computational methods reveals an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation by a formal chromium(II) center, suggesting that this complex is best described as a chromium(IV)-metallocyclopropene. Exposure of this compound to 4,4 & PRIME;-difluoroazobenzene results in the formation of a chromium(VI) diimido complex, which constitutes a rare 4-electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond. The isolation of a chromium(IV)-hydrazido intermediate enabled mechanistic investigations of this challenging bond cleavage process. This work substantiates the notion that terminal phosphinimide ligands can engender first-row transition metal ions with exceptional reactivity. This report describes the synthesis of a chromium alkyne complex supported by a bidentate phosphinimide ligand. This compound features an unprecedented extent of alkyne activation, exposure of which to an azobenzene derivative leads to a rare 4-electron oxidative addition of an N=N double bond across a single chromium center.**image	[Rathke, Paul; Rittle, Jonathan] Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA	University of California System; University of California Berkeley	Rittle, J (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Coll Chem, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.	rittle@berkeley.edu			University of California Berkeley; Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231]; NIH [S10OD024998]	University of California Berkeley(University of California System); Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)	This research was supported by the University of California Berkeley.

J	Rollo, F; Buscarnera, G				Rollo, Fabio; Buscarnera, Giuseppe			Modelling seasonal landslide motion: Does it only depend on fluctuations in normal effective stress?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS			English	Article; Early Access						constitutive modelling; hydro-mechanical coupling; rainfall-induced landslides; slope deformation	OVERCONSOLIDATED CLAYS; ATMOSPHERE INTERACTION; FLOW; MECHANISMS; INITIATION; RAINFALL; BEHAVIOR; SLOPE	Landslide motion is often simulated with interface-like laws able to capture changes in frictional strength caused by the growth of the pore water pressure and the consequent reduction of the effective stress normal to the plane of sliding. Here it is argued that, although often neglected, the evolution of all the 3D stress components within the basal shear zone of landslides also contributes to changes in frictional strength and must be accounted for to predict changes in seasonal velocity. For this purpose, an augmented sliding-consolidation model is proposed which allows for the computation of excess pore pressure development and downslope sliding with any constitutive law with 3D stress evolution. Simulations of idealised infinite slope models subjected to hydrologic forcing are used to study the role of in-situ stress conditions and stress rate multiaxiality. Specifically, a Drucker-Prager perfectly plastic model is used to replicate frictional failure and shear deformation at the base of landslides. The model reveals that conditions amenable to the shearing of a frictional interface are met only after numerous rainfall cycles, that is, when multiaxial stress rates are suppressed. In this case, the landslide is predicted to move through a seasonal ratcheting controlled only by the effective stress component normal to the plane of sliding. By contrast, in newly formed landslides, the multiaxial stress evolution is found to produce further regimes of motion, from plastic shakedown to cyclic failure, neither of which can be captured by interface-like frictional laws. Notably, the model suggests that a transition across these regimes can emerge in response to an aggravation of the magnitude of forcing, implying that (i) fluctuations in climate may alter the seasonal trends of motion observed today; (ii) our ability to quantify landslide-induced risks is impaired unless proper geomechanical models are used to examine their long-term dynamics.

J	Sciacca, G				Sciacca, Giulio			Grounding and boundaries	ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY			English	Article; Early Access								This paper discusses a recent puzzle concerning the notions of boundary parthood and dependence, and offers a new solution. The puzzle was originally presented by Jeroen Smid and successively elaborated upon by Claudio Calosi. I first reformulate some of the troublesome premises. Particularly, whereas Smid and Calosi discuss the puzzle in terms of an underspecified notion of dependence, I propose to construe it in terms of the notion of grounding. In this manner, the dependence relation inherently carries an asymmetry, and we can effectively utilize its four places. The solution I advance precisely takes advantage of this feature of dependence. My proposal avoids the contradiction while still respecting the intuitions driving the original premises. It is also fully compatible with boundaries being only generically dependent on their wholes.				giulio.sciacca@gmail.com			The author thanks Roberto Loss, who has been providing invaluable help and support on the present issues.

Both compositions were prepared through auto gel-combustion followed by sintering under the identical conditions. Systematic analysis of the compositions before and after irradiation was performed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and plane-view high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. Irradiation caused pyrochlore to amorphous phase transformation was observed in both compositions except the slower rate of amorphization in Nd1.8Zr2.2O7.1. The amorphization was achieved as a consequence of isolated disordered track overlapping at higher ion fluence with the estimated track diameter 2.73 +/- 0.05 and 3.46 +/- 0.30 nm for Nd1.8Zr2.2O7.1 and Nd2Zr2O7, respectively, employing the framework of single-ion impact model to XRD results. HRTEM micrographs also revealed the less prevalence of irradiation-induced amorphization in Nd1.8Zr2.2O7.1 with the observed irradiation-induced modified track region composed of defect-rich pyrochlore structure, anion-deficient fluorite structure, and amorphous domains; with the diameter of 3.0 +/- 1.0 nm and 5.0 +/- 1.0 nm in Nd1.8Zr2.2O7.1 and Nd2Zr2O7, respectively. The preexisting anion-deficient fluorite structure in Nd1.8Zr2.2O7.1 helps in its epitaxial growth as recovered structure from melted ion track during irradiation-induced rapid cooling.

Pupillary dilation velocity is reduced in intensive care unit patients with septic shock	ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article; Early Access						autonomic dysfunction; intensive care unit; pupillary light response; septic shock	INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS DEFINITIONS; SEPSIS	BackgroundSeptic shock is common in the intensive care unit (ICU). The pathophysiology is poorly understood but prolonged sympathetic activation leading to autonomic dysfunction may be involved. Pupillary light response (PLR) is a fast, inexpensive, noninvasive way to measure autonomic nervous system function. The aim of the study was to observe dilation velocity of the PLR (PLRdil.vel .) in patients with and without septic shock and explore whether other factors influenced the possible association. We hypothesized that the presence of septic shock in intensive care patients is associated with changes in sympathetic autonomic tone, which can be observed as changes in PLRdil.vel .MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort study, we included 91 adult patients acutely admitted to a mixed ICU. The patients were followed for the development of septic shock until ICU discharge. PLRdil.vel . was measured with a portable pupillometer two times a day. We used linear mixed models to analyze for an association between PLR(dil.vel )and septic shock along with several covariables.ResultsNinety-one patients were enrolled and of these, 35 were in septic shock. Septic shock was associated with a slowed PLR(dil.vel )of 0.3 mm/s (95% confidence intervals [CI -0.4; -0.2]).ConclusionsSeptic shock may be associated with changes in sympathetic autonomic tone which is supported by the findings from this study that septic shock was associated with a slower dilation velocity in the pupillary light reflex. Further studies should examine if the pupillary dilation velocity may serve as surrogate marker for changes in sympathetic autonomic nervous system activity in intensive care patients in septic shock. If so, future interventional studies should test if use of the pupillary dilation velocity may be used for earlier detection of septic shock, which could mean earlier institution of treatment measures for this condition.

Using a community-based participatory approach to intervention design, we conducted four dyadic focus groups, including African American community members with hypertension (n = 23) and their family members (n = 23), recruited from African American-serving Christian churches in a large, southern metropolitan area. We used open-ended questions to elicit participants' perspectives regarding program features they would recommend, intervention delivery, and barriers necessary to address. Our grounded theory analysis identified themes reflecting participants' recommendations for hypertension self-management interventions to enhance health literacy and provide communication training via an accessible, population-tailored, family-based approach, which they believed has the potential to create family-level impact on health across generations. Participants also recommended intervention researchers engage in advocacy (i.e., via physician education and policy change) as part of a broader impact on structural inequities driving worse hypertension and health outcomes for African Americans. The perceptions and recommendations of African Americans with a lived experience of hypertension, as well as their family members, aid in shaping acceptable and efficacious behavioral interventions aiming to promote hypertension self-management behavior while leveraging the unique power of family relationships to create sustained behavior change.

The formation of a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution-processed heterostructures at the buried interface faces solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying-layer disruption, and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, a hybrid two-step deposition method is used to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross-linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits by way of preferred crystal growth of strain-free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect-induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge-carrier extraction with ideal energy-level alignment. The broad applicability of the bottom-contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion are demonstrated. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells, based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon, achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1000 h operation. Using a hybrid two-step deposition method, prepared robust 2D perovskites with cross-linkable ligands underneath 3D perovskite enable the formation of a conformal 2D/3D heterostructure at the buried interface. Owing to the influence of the heterojunction on crystallization and interfacial modulation, perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells based on industrially fully textured silicon achieve an efficiency of 29.8% (certified 28.4%).image	[Zhang, Fu; Tu, Binbin; Liu, Zhiliang; Xiong, Zhijun; Yao, Kai] Nanchang Univ, Inst Photovolta, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China; [Yang, Shaofei; Liu, Zhiliang; Yu, Cao] Suzhou Maxwell Technol Co Ltd, Suzhou 215200, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ke; Huang, Haitao] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie; Jen, Alex K. -y] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei] Wuhan Univ Technol, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synth & Proc, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China	Nanchang University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS; Wuhan University of Technology	Yao, K (corresponding author), Nanchang Univ, Inst Photovolta, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Nanchang 330031, Peoples R China.	yaokai@ncu.edu.cn		Yu, Cao/0000-0001-6307-2245	National Natural Science Foundation of China [62274080, 61874052]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, China [20224ACB214003]; Thousand Talents Plan of Jiangxi Province [jxsq2019201109]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province, China(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); Thousand Talents Plan of Jiangxi Province	F.Z., B.T., and S.Y. contributed equally to this work.

Currently developed and reported sorbents in (TcO4-)-Tc-99 sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post-synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole-based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF-polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (<5 min) and good sorption capacity (388 mg g(-1)) for ReO4- (a nonradioactive surrogate of (TcO4-)-Tc-99). Outstandingly, COF-polyILs composite shows superior ReO4- removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low-level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.

Development and validation of an automated microfluidic perfusion platform for parallelized screening of compounds in vitro	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						automated screening; microfluidics; neurotransmitter; release assay; serotonin	CARRIER-MEDIATED RELEASE; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; PSYCHOACTIVE-DRUGS; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; MONOAMINE; AMPHETAMINE; INHIBITION; MEPHEDRONE; COCAINE	Monoamine transporters are of great interest for their role in the physiological activity of the body and their link to mental and behavioural disorders. Currently, static well-plate assays or manual perfusion systems are used to characterize the interaction of psychostimulants, antidepressants and drugs of abuse with the transporters but still suffer from significant drawbacks caused by lack of automation, for example, low reproducibility, non-comparability of results. An automated microfluidic platform was developed to address the need for more standardized procedures for cell-based assays. An automated system was used to control and drive the simultaneous perfusion of 12 channels on a microfluidic chip, establishing a more standardized protocol to perform release assays to study monoamine transporter-mediated substrate efflux. D-Amphetamine, GBR12909 (norepinephrine transporter) and p-chloroamphetamine, paroxetine (serotonin transporter) were used as control compounds to validate the system. The platform was able to produce the expected releasing (D-Amphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine) or inhibiting (GBR12909, paroxetine) profiles for the two transporters. The reduction of manual operation and introduction of automated flow control enabled the implementation of stronger standardized protocols and the possibility of obtaining higher throughput by increasing parallelization.

Factors associated with daily use of benzodiazepines/tranquilizers and opioids among people who use drugs	AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS			English	Article; Early Access							NONMEDICAL BENZODIAZEPINE USE; RISK-FACTORS; INJECT DRUGS; PRESCRIPTION; PATTERNS; PREVALENCE; DISCHARGE; OVERDOSE; ADULTS; TRENDS	Background: Co-use of benzodiazepines and opioids significantly increases fatal overdose risk, yet few studies have examined co-use of these drugs when obtained both with and without a prescription. We examined associations of daily co-use of prescribed benzodiazepines/tranquilizers (BZD/TRQ) and prescribed and nonprescribed opioids among people who use street opioids (PWUO).Methods: PWUO (N = 417) were recruited from Baltimore City and neighboring Anne Arundel County, Maryland, and surveyed on sociodemographic characteristics, structural vulnerabilities, healthcare access and utilization, substance use, and overdose experiences. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with self-reported co-use.Results: Participants were 46 years old on average, and predominantly Black (74%) males (62%). Daily co-use was reported by 22%. In multivariable analyses, odds of co-use were significantly higher among participants who did not have a high school degree/GED (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.88), endorsed receiving mental health treatment in the past 6 months (aOR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.28-3.56), reported daily use of powdered cocaine (aOR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.98-6.45), and synthetic cannabinoids (aOR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.40-6.93). Odds of co-use were significantly lower among Black participants compared to white participants (aOR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.19-0.82).Conclusions and Scientific Significance: Clinicians working with PWUO or who prescribe BZDs or opioids should screen patients who use cocaine or synthetic cannabinoids, have low level of educational attainment, or recently accessed mental health services, as these patients may be at higher risk for daily co-use of BZD/TRQ and opioids, and therefore lethal overdose.

The study involved, study for glucose uptake, fluorescence-activated cell sorting for glucose transporter, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide for cell survival, Picto-micrography for clonogenic assay, glutamine uptake assay, extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption rate, carbon dioxide release assay and lactate assay were also done. In addition to this, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for expression of genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, western blot for protein expression, and immunohistochemical analysis in tumor sections, the tumors were studied by imaging for hypoxia and localization of TKT and CTPS-2. Also, patient-derived xenograft tumors were engrafted in nude mice, followed by a glucose uptake assay. We reported that elevated glycolytic flux causes dependence on glucose in cancer cells and, at the same time, increases pyrimidine biosynthesis. It was also found that stem cell factor-mediated stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) modulates the resistance in PC. Targeting HIF-1a in combination with 5-FU, strongly reduced the tumor burden. The study concludes that stem cell factor modulates HIF-1a and decreases the sensitivity in 5-FU resistant pancreatic cancer cells by targeting glucose metabolism. Deceased expression levels of CTPS-2 and TKT, which are regulators of pyrimidine biosynthesis could better the chance of survival in patients of pancreatic cancer receiving treatment of 5-FU.

J	Borghi, M; Mariani, MM; Vega, RP; Wirtz, J				Borghi, Matteo; Mariani, Marcello M.; Vega, Rodrigo P.; Wirtz, Jochen			The impact of service robots on customer satisfaction online ratings: The moderating effects of rapport and contextual review factors	PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING			English	Review; Early Access						customer satisfaction; eWOM; mobile; online reviews; rapport; service robot	WORD-OF-MOUTH; SELF-SERVICE; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; TECHNOLOGY	Recent research has established a positive relationship between the use of service robots powered by artificial intelligence in hospitality firms and customer satisfaction online ratings, a particularly important form of electronic word of mouth. However, it is not clear if and how this relationship is augmented or diminished by moderating factors. In this study, we examined four potential moderators by using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to analyze 20,166 online reviews of hotels that had implemented service robots. We had four key findings. First, a positive service robot-satisfaction rating relationship was further enhanced by improved customer-service robot rapport during the service encounter. Second, higher customer effort focused on service robots in a review reduced the service robot-satisfaction rating relationship. Third, posting reviews using a mobile device (vs. other devices) showed higher satisfaction ratings. Finally, customers' prior experience in writing online reviews was unrelated to the service robot-satisfaction rating relationship. Taken together, these results suggest that service robots should be designed to be interactive and encourage customers to build rapport, for example, by service robots engaging in conversational flows. Moreover, customers should be nudged to use their mobile devices to post timely reviews on their positive human-robot interactions.

J	Chen, LY; Zhang, ZJ				Chen, Liuyin; Zhang, Zijun			The self-distillation trained multitask dense-attention network for diagnosing lung cancers based on CT scans	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						deep neural networks; lung adenocarcinoma; multitask modeling	ADENOCARCINOMA; CLASSIFICATION	Background: The latest international multidisciplinary histopathological classification of lung cancer indicates that a deeper study of the lung adenocarcinoma requires a comprehensive multidisciplinary platform. However, in the traditional pathological examination or previous computer-vision-based research, the entire lung is not considered in a comprehensive manner. Purpose: The study aims to develop a deep learning model proposed for diagnosing the lung adenocarcinoma histopathologically based on CT scans. Instead of just classifying the lung adenocarcinoma, the pathological report should be inferred based on both the invasiveness and growth pattern of the tumors. Methods: A self -distillation trained multitask dense-attention network (SD-MdaNet) is proposed and validated based on 2412 labeled CT scans from 476 patients and 845 unlabeled scans. Inferring the pathological report is divided into two tasks, predicting the invasiveness of the lung tumor and inferring growth patterns of tumor cells in a comprehensive histopathological subtyping manner with excellent accuracy. In the proposed method, the dense-attention module is introduced to better extract features from a small dataset in the main branch of the MdaNet. Next, task-specific attention modules are utilized in different branches and finally integrated as a multitask model. The second task is a blend of classification and regression tasks. Thus, a specialized loss function is developed. In the proposed knowledge distillation (KD) process, the MdaNet as well as its main branch trained for solving two single tasks, respectively, are treated as multiple teachers to produce a student model. A novel KD loss function is developed to take the advantage of all the models as well as data with labels and without labels. Results: SD-MdaNet achieves an AUC of 98.7 +/- 0.4% on invasiveness prediction, and 91.6 +/- 1.0% on predominant growth pattern prediction on our dataset. Moreover, the averagemean squared error in inferring growth pattern proportion reaches 0.0217 +/- 0.0019, and the AUC for predominant growth pattern proportion reaches 91.6 +/- 1.0%. The proposed SD-MdaNet is significantly better than all other benchmarking methods (FDR < 0.05). Conclusions: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SD-MdaNet can significantly improve the performance of the lung adenocarcinoma pathological diagnosis using only CT scans. Analyses and discussions are conducted to interpret the advantages of the SD-MdaNet.

This Part 3 Review focuses on the molecular diagnostics and imaging findings of glioneuronal and neuronal tumors. Histological and molecular features in glioneuronal and neuronal tumors often overlap with pediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas and circumscribed astrocytic gliomas (discussed in the Part 2 Review). Due to this overlap, in several tumor types of glioneuronal and neuronal tumors the diagnosis may be inconclusive with histopathology and genetic alterations, and imaging features may be helpful to distinguish difficult cases. Thus, it is crucial for radiologists to understand the underlying molecular diagnostics as well as imaging findings for application on clinical practice.

Primary outcome measure was adequacy of uterine tone at 4 min after initiating oxytocin infusion. Oxytocin associated side effects were also observed.ResultsSignificantly less oxytocin was used with the weight-based versus fixed-dose regimen (16.3 [11.2-22.4] IU vs 20.4 [15.8-26.9] IU; P = 0.036). Incidence of adequate uterine tone was clinically greater but not significantly different with the weight-based versus fixed-dose regimen (81.3% vs 71.9%; P = 0.376). The weight-based regimen was associated with clinically lesser, although not statistically significant need for rescue oxytocin (25% vs 46.9%; P = 0.068) and additional uterotonic (9.4% vs 15.6%; P = 0.708); as well as oxytocin associated side effects (hypotension [34.4% vs 46.9%; P = 0.309], nausea/vomiting [18.8% vs 40.6%; P = 0.055], and ST-T changes [0% vs 3.1%; P = 1.000]).ConclusionWeight-based oxytocin was not significantly different from the fixed-dose regimen in terms of uterotonic efficacy or associated side-effects, despite significantly lower doses being used. Use of weight-based oxytocin infusion (0.4 IU/kg/h) can be considered in clinical practice.Trial RegistrationClinical Trial Registry of India (, number. CTRI/2021/01/030642). Using weight-based oxytocin infusion results in significant reduction in dose (P = 0.036), while achieving a similar incidence of adequate uterine tone during cesarean section.

J	Zheng, YP; Yang, BW; Sarem, M				Zheng, Yunping; Yang, Bowen; Sarem, Mudar			FNRegion: A fast NAM-based region extraction algorithm	IET IMAGE PROCESSING			English	Article; Early Access						image processing; image representation		Region extraction is usually used by many computer vision tasks as a pre-processing step to extract image features. However, how to efficiently extract effective regions remains a challenging problem. In this paper, inspired by the non-symmetry and anti-packing pattern representation model (NAM) and the FatRegion algorithm, a fast NAM-based region extraction algorithm which is called FNRegion is proposed. A NAM-based homogeneous block generation algorithm is first presented to represent an image as a combination of multiple homogeneous blocks, each of which is a square region with visually indistinguishable intra-region colour difference. Then, these homogeneous blocks are merged into larger regions according to their colour and shape information. To group these regions into larger ones in order to progressively build a region tree, a distance function is defined using variety of regional information to measure the distance between adjacent regions. Also, a multi-feature region merging algorithm with linear complexity both in time and space is presented.The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on multiple public datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art region extraction algorithms. The experimental results show that in the case of almost the same or even less running time as other fast region extraction algorithms, the proposed algorithm is able to extract higher-quality regions.

In this study, we identified novel compound heterozygous MEIOB variants (c.814C > T: p.R272X and c.976G > A: p.A326T) and a previously undescribed homozygous non-canonical splicing variant of MEIOB (c.528 + 3A > C) in two NOA-affected individuals from two irrelevant Chinese families. MEIOB missense variant (p.A326T) significantly reduced protein abundance and nonsense variant (p.R272X) produced a truncated protein. Both of two variants impaired the MEIOB-SPATA22 interaction. The MEIOB non-canonical splicing variant resulted in whole Exon 6 skipping by minigene assay, which was predicted to produce a frameshift truncated protein (p.S111Rfs*32). Histological and immunostaining analysis indicated that both patients exhibited a similar phenotype as we previously reported in Meiob mutant mice, that is, absence of spermatids in seminiferous tubules and meiotic arrest. Our study identified three novel pathogenic variants of MEIOB in NOA patients, extending the mutation spectrum of the MEIOB and highlighting the contribution of meiotic recombination related genes in human fertility.

They were equally divided into three groups, assigned to treatment with tadalafil 5 mg/day (Group 1), tadalafil 5 mg/day plus dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (Group 2) and dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (Group 3) for 3 months. The presence and the severity of ED were evaluated at enrolment and after treatment, by the International Index of Erectile Function 5-item (IIEF-5) questionnaire and the dynamic penile echo colour Doppler ultrasound (PCDU) examination.Results: At the end of treatment, the three groups showed a significant improvement in IIEF-5 score, by 294%, 375% and 197%, in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. PCDU evaluation showed a significant increase in peak systolic velocity by 178.9%, 339% and 153%; acceleration time was significantly shortened in Group 2 (-26.2%) and was significantly lower than in Group 1 and 3 (-7.2% and -6.6%), while no significant difference was found in end-diastolic velocity after treatment. The greatest rates of improvement were observed in Group 2 for all the end points.Conclusions: Dapagliflozin improves ED in patients with T2DM and enhances the efficacy of tadalafil. Further studies are needed to confirm our results explain the mechanism(s) by which dapagliflozin exerts its effects on ED.

Herein, based on a model electrocatalyst of single-iridium-atom-doped iron (Fe)-based layered double hydroxides (LDH) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we reveal the first completed origin of the catalytic performance of such supported nanocatalysts. Specially, besides the activity enhancement of Ir sites by LDH support, the stability of surface Fe sites is enhanced by doped Ir sites: DFT calculation shows that the Ir sites can reduce the activity and enhance the stability of the nearby Fe sites; while further finite element simulations indicate, the stability enhancement of distant Fe sites could be attributed to the much low concentration of OER reactant (hydroxyl ions, OH-) around them induced by the much fast consumption of OH- on highly active Ir sites. These new findings about the interaction between the main active components and supports are applicable in principle to other heterogeneous nanocatalysts and provide a completed understanding to the catalytic performance of heterogeneous nanocatalysts. The completed origin of the catalytic performance of Ir/CoFe-LDH for OER from the points of view of both the active center and the support.image	[Cao, Jing; Yao, Pengfei; Han, Ce; Gong, Xue; Song, Ping; Xu, Weilin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Electroanalyt Chem, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jing; Yao, Pengfei; Han, Ce; Gong, Xue; Song, Ping; Xu, Weilin] Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, Jilin Prov Key Lab Low Carbon Chem Power, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jing; Yao, Pengfei; Han, Ce; Gong, Xue; Song, Ping; Xu, Weilin] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Mou, Tong; Xiao, Jianping] Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Catalysis, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China; [Mei, Bingbao] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Shanghai 201800, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zheng] Univ Sci & Technol China, Natl Synchrotron Radiat Lab, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Frauenheim, Thomas] Shenzhen JL Computat & Appl Res Inst, Shenzhen 518131, Peoples R China; [Frauenheim, Thomas] Univ Bremen, Bremen Ctr Computat Mat Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Mou, Tong; Frauenheim, Thomas; Xiao, Jianping] Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China	Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS; State Key Laboratory of Catalysis, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; University of Bremen; Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics; Beijing Computational Science Research Center (CSRC)	Xu, WL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Electroanalyt Chem, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China.; Xu, WL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Changchun Inst Appl Chem, Jilin Prov Key Lab Low Carbon Chem Power, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China.; Xu, WL (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.; Xiao, JP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Inst Chem Phys, State Key Lab Catalysis, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian 116023, Peoples R China.; Frauenheim, T (corresponding author), Shenzhen JL Computat & Appl Res Inst, Shenzhen 518131, Peoples R China.; Frauenheim, T (corresponding author), Univ Bremen, Bremen Ctr Computat Mat Sci, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.; Frauenheim, T; Xiao, JP (corresponding author), Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.	thomas.frauenheim@bccms.unibremen.de; xiao@dicp.ac.cn; weilinxu@ciac.ac.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [21925205, 22072145, 22102172, 22005294, 21721003, 22172156, 91945302]; Key Research and Development Program - Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [2022YFA1203400, 2018YFB1502302]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFA1500702]; DNL Cooperation Fund, CAS [DNL202003]; Liao Ning Revitalization Talents program [XLYC1907099]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB36030200]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program - Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST); National Key Research and Development Program of China; DNL Cooperation Fund, CAS; Liao Ning Revitalization Talents program; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)	We acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21925205, 22072145,22102172, 22005294, 21721003), and the Key Research and Development Program sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) (No.2022YFA1203400, 2018YFB1502302); J.X. acknowledges the support of the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFA1500702), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 22172156, 91945302), the DNL Cooperation Fund, CAS (DNL202003), Liao Ning Revitalization Talents program (No. XLYC1907099), and Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDB36030200).		48	0	0	25	25	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1433-7851	1521-3773		ANGEW CHEM INT EDIT	Angew.

Gamification&apos;s role in fostering user engagement with healthy food-based digital content	PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING			English	Article; Early Access						challenge; engagement; experience; gamification; healthy food; mobile apps; state of change	CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT; CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT; FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS; BRAND ENGAGEMENT; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; EXPERIENCE; SCALE; MOOD; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES	Though digital platforms (e.g., social media) are often used to promote unhealthy, calorie-dense foods, the dynamics characterizing consumers' engagement with healthy nutrition-based content (e.g., as stimulated trough gamification) on these platforms remains tenuous, warranting further exploration. Addressing this gap, we deploy a qualitative field study and two experiments to show that challenge, a gamification mechanic that relies on rewarding incremental behavioral (e.g., food choice) improvements, shapes consumers' enjoyment of, and engagement with, digital healthy food-based content. Study 1 (n = 95) shows that challenge induces consumer enjoyment, boosting their engagement with healthy food-related digital content. Study 2 (n = 94) corroborates these findings by revealing a serial mediation effect of gamification-based challenge on consumers' enjoyment of, and engagement with, healthy food-based content. Extending Study 1, we also identify engagement's positive effect on consumers' app reuse intent. Moreover, we identify a moderating role of consumers' stage of change-based action (i.e., readiness to act on their health), which strengthens the association of gamification-based challenge/enjoyment. Overall, the findings substantiate gamification's role in boosting consumers' engagement with digital healthy food-based content. We conclude by deriving pertinent implications from our analyses.

These complexes are screened as catalysts for acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) of primary alcohols and aromatic diamines for the synthesis of benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives with the release of H2 and H2O as byproducts. The protic complex Mn(L1)(CO)3Br shows the highest catalytic activity for the synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazole derivatives with broad substrate scope, whereas a related complex [Mn(L3)(CO)3Br], which is devoid of the proton responsive & beta;-NH unit, shows significantly reduced catalytic efficiency validating the crucial role of the & beta;-NH functionality for the alcohol dehydrogenation reactions. Control experiments, kinetic and deuterated studies, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a synchronous hydride-proton transfer by the metal-ligand construct in the alcohol dehydrogenation step. A protic Mn(I) complex featuring pyrazole functionality was evaluated for dehydrogenative coupling reactions to access benzimidazole and quinoline derivatives. Kinetic experiments and DFT calculations reveal that the initial alcohol dehydrogenation step proceeds through a concerted proton and hydride transfers to pyrazolato N and Mn, respectively, on the metal-ligand construct.image	[De, Subhabrata; Ranjan, Prabodh; Chaurasia, Vishal; Pal, Sourav; Pal, Saikat; Pandey, Pragati; Bera, Jitendra K.] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Chem, Kanpur 208016, India; [De, Subhabrata; Ranjan, Prabodh; Chaurasia, Vishal; Pal, Sourav; Pal, Saikat; Pandey, Pragati; Bera, Jitendra K.] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Kanpur 208016, India	Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Kanpur	Bera, JK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Chem, Kanpur 208016, India.; Bera, JK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Kanpur 208016, India.	jbera@iitk.ac.in		DE, SUBHABRATA/0000-0003-3916-6377	Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), India, is gratefully acknowledged for financial support.

The significance of this study lies in the development of a rapid, sensitive, and alternative method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the accurate quantification and identification of RA and A1 in vivo. MethodsLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was employed to analyze RA and A1 in rat plasma. A C18 column (1.9 & mu;m, 2.1 x 100 mm) with a C18 guard column (5 & mu;m, 2.1 x 10 mm) and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer combined with an electrospray ionization source were utilized. Sample pretreatment involved a one-step protein precipitation using isopropanol:ethyl acetate (20:80, v/v) as the solvent. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride served as a standard. ResultsThe developed method exhibited a linear relationship within the concentration ranges of 5-750 ng/ml for both RA and A1. Relative standard deviations in daily courses were less than 15%, and the relative errors recorded were within 15%. This is the first study to concentrate on determining A1 and RA in rat plasma through oral administration. ConclusionsThe liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method developed in this study offers a rapid, sensitive, and alternative approach for the accurate quantification and identification of RA and A1 in vivo. The findings serve as a significant foundation for evaluating the clinical applications of the medicine.

This work, following the same team's most recent identification of the potential-limiting step of Li-S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions, seeks to advance the understanding by extending it to a new catalyst and into the high-sulfur-mass-loading region. CeOx nanostructures are integrated into cotton-derived carbon to develop a multifunctional 3D network that can host a large amount of active material, facilitate electron transport, and catalyze the sulfur lithiation reaction. The resulting S/CeOx/C electrode can deliver a stable areal capacity of 9 mAh cm-2 with a high sulfur loading of 14 mg cm-2 at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5 & mu;L mg-1. This study discovers that Li||S/CeOx/C cells usually fail during charging at high current density, as a consequence of local short circuiting caused by electrochemically deposited Li dendrites penetrating through the separator, a previously overlooked failure pattern distinctive to cells operating under lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the importance of developing new material structures and analyzing failure mechanisms in the advancement of Li-S batteries. A 3D sulfur electrode with cotton-derived carbon as the substrate and CeOx as the catalyst is developed to achieve high sulfur mass loading and fast reaction kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The resulting Li-S cell is found to fail after 100-200 cycles during charging due to local short circuiting caused by Li dendrites penetrating the separator.image	[Fu, Shuting; Wang, Hongmin; Zhong, Yiren; Schaefer, Samuel; Wang, Hailiang] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Fu, Shuting; Wang, Hongmin; Zhong, Yiren; Schaefer, Samuel; Wang, Hailiang] Yale Univ, Energy Sci Inst, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Fu, Shuting; Wu, Mingmei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Chem, MOE Key Lab Bioinorgan & Synthet Chem, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Fu, Shuting; Wu, Mingmei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Li, Min] Yale Univ, Mat Characterizat Core, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA	Yale University; Yale University; Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University; Yale University	Wang, HM; Wang, HL (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.; Wang, HM; Wang, HL (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Energy Sci Inst, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.; Wu, MM (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Chem, MOE Key Lab Bioinorgan & Synthet Chem, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Wu, MM (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.	hongmin.wang@yale.edu; ceswmm@mail.sysu.edu.cn; hailiang.wang@yale.edu	Wang, Hongmin/HMV-9249-2023; Wang, Hailiang/O-6364-2017	Wang, Hongmin/0000-0003-2714-4250; Wang, Hailiang/0000-0003-4409-2034	U.S. National Science Foundation [CBET-1903342]; Guangzhou Elite Project	U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Guangzhou Elite Project	This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (CBET-1903342).

We investigated fisheries of the Lower Amazon in Brazil using a wavelet analysis of a 13-year data series of fishery catches, environmental variables, and climatic indices, to determine how these variables affected catches of different species. The catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of gillnet and line fisheries increased over time. Relative humidity, latent heat, and sea surface temperatures influenced productivity of both fisheries. El Nino had a negative and immediate effect on gillnet CPUE, while its effect on line fishing was positive, with an eight month lag. Our findings indicate that fishery productivity was modulated by climate events, which influenced ecosystems and modified habitats and ecological niches, and thereby impacted fishery productivity.

Heavy-metal tolerant bacterial strains isolated from industrial sites and scrap yards in Kashmir, India	JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						bioremediation; heavy metal; iron and copper metal contamination; metal tolerance; minimum inhibitory concentration	CR VI; BIOSORPTION; IRON; BIOREMEDIATION; DETOXIFICATION; WATER	Heavy metal pollution has posed a severe danger to environmental stability due to its high toxicity and lack of biodegradability. The present study deals with the appraisement of tolerance shown by various bacteria in varied copper and iron concentrations. Among the 20 isolates, four isolates, GN2, SC5, SC8, and SC10, exhibiting more significant iron and copper tolerance, were selected and identified by 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequence analysis as Pantoea agglomerans strain GN2, Pantoea sp. strain SC5, Bacillus sp. strain SC8 and Priestia aryabhattaistrain SC10. The minimum inhibitory concentration of molecularly identified strains revealed that P. agglomerans strain GN2 showed tolerance to iron sulfate and copper sulfate upto 600 and 400 mu g/mL, whereas Bacillus sp. SC8 (OQ202165) showed tolerance of 700 and 250 mu g/mL were tolerant to iron sulfate and copper sulfate up to 700 and 150 mu g/mL, respectively. Pantoea sp. strain SC5 showed significant tolerance to both heavy metals. The isolates were further studied for their ability to grow at varying temperatures and pH ranges. Most of the isolates showed optimal growth at 37 degrees C and pH 7. However, Pantoea sp. SC5 was competent to have prominent growth at 45 degrees C and pH 8.0. Microbial remediation, which is ecofriendly, has proven the most effective method for bioremediation of heavy metal-contaminated environments. Using heavy metal-resistant bacteria for microbial remediation of iron and copper-contaminated environments could be a viable and valuable strategy. These isolates could also be used to decontaminate heavy metal-polluted agricultural soils.

The garnet-type material Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) is recognized as a highly promising active filler for enhancing the performance of PEO-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, its performance is still limited by its high interfacial resistance. In this study, a novel hybrid filler-designed SPE is employed to achieve excellent electrochemical performance for both the lithium metal anode and the LiFePO4 cathode. The solid composite membrane containing hybrid fillers achieves a maximum ionic conductivity of 1.9 x 10-4 S cm-1 and a Li+ transference number of 0.67 at 40 & DEG;C, respectively. Additionally, the Li/Li symmetric cells demonstrate a smooth and stable process for 2000 h at a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery delivers a high-rate capacity of 159.2 mAh g-1 at 1 C, along with a capacity retention of 95.2% after 400 cycles. These results validate that employing a composite of both active and inactive fillers is an effective strategy for achieving superior performance in all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) provide safety benefits for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs), yet hurdles such as restricted ion conductivity and electrochemical stability remain. The innovation in this work introduces a groundbreaking solid composite polymer electrolyte, delivering exceptional ionic conductivity, an extended electrochemical window, and stable cycling performance.image	[Khan, Kashif; Xu, Ziqiang; Wu, Mengqiang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Yangtze Delta Reg Inst Huzhou, Huzhou 313001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Khan, Kashif; Xin, Hu; Fu, Bowen; Fang, Zixuan; Xu, Ziqiang; Wu, Mengqiang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Mat & Energy, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Hanif, Muhammad Bilal; Motola, Martin] Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Inorgan Chem, Bratislava SK-84215, Slovakia; [Hussain, Arshad] Shenzhen Univ, Inst Adv Study, Guangdong 518060, Peoples R China; [Ali, Hina Ghulam] Helmholtz Inst Ulm Electrochem Energy Storage HIU, Helmholtzstr 11, D-89081 Ulm, Germany	University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Comenius University Bratislava; Shenzhen University; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology	Khan, K; Wu, MQ (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Yangtze Delta Reg Inst Huzhou, Huzhou 313001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.	kashif0101@yahoo.com; mwu@uestc.edu.cn	khan, kashif/HNI-7100-2023	khan, kashif/0000-0003-2115-9240	Key R D program [2019ZDZX0029, 2020YFG0339]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M710619]	Key R D program; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)	This work was supported by the Key R & D program (#2019ZDZX0029 and #2020YFG0339) of Sichuan Province, and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (#2022M710619).		57	0	0	20	20	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1613-6810	1613-6829		SMALL	Small	2023 SEP 15	2023										10.1002/smll.202305772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202305772		SEP 2023	9	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics	R6PG2	37712152				2023-10-18	WOS:001065549700001

It is unknown if immunosuppressed patients with cancer, who may be at higher risk for complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are disproportionately impacted. Thus, we aimed to compare delays in cancer treatment initiation between people living with HIV (PLWH) and cancer, the general cancer population (GCP), and patients with cancer and a history of solid organ transplant (SOT). Comparisons were made across the period 2 years preceding the pandemic versus the first year of the pandemic.Methods: We used data from a real-world electronic health record-derived de-identified database (2018-2021) comprised of US patients with cancer from 800 sites of care across the country. We included patients with 19 different cancer types. We calculated time to cancer treatment initiation (TTI) as the difference between the date of cancer diagnosis and the earliest date that cancer treatment was recorded.Results: The sample included 181 PLWH, 65,073 GCP patients, and 195 patients with a SOT. Difference-in-difference regression models adjusted for age, sex, and presence of metastatic disease at cancer diagnosis revealed a significant increase in delayed TTI among PLWH compared to the GCP during COVID-19 versus prior to COVID-19, with delays increasing by approximately 1 month during the pandemic (DID: 32.6 days [8.9-56.3]; p = 0.007). The increase in TTI for PLWH was observed across treatment modalities, including surgery (DID: 55.1 [28.8-81.3], p < 0.001) and systemic therapy (DID: 30.4 [4.6-56.3], p = 0.021).Conclusions/Relevance: PLWH experienced significant delays in cancer treatment initiation after diagnosis during the first year of COVID-19, delays that may negatively impact cancer outcomes. These data warrant patient and provider attention as the pandemic continues to impact the US healthcare system.

J	Liu, AX; Yang, YB				Liu, Angxin; Yang, Yongbiao			A multilevel segmentation method of asymmetric semantics based on deep learning	IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						big data; computer network security		An asymmetric semantic multi-level segmentation method based on depth learning is proposed in order to improve the precision and effect of semantic segmentation. A 'content tree' structure and an adjacency matrix are constructed to represent the parent-child relationship between each image sub region in a complete image. Through multiple combinations of spatial attention mechanism and channel attention mechanism, the similarity semantic features of the target object can be selectively aggregated, so as to enhance its feature expression and avoid the impact of significant objects. The asymmetric semantic segmentation model asymmetric pyramid feature convolutional network (APFCN) is constructed, and the path feature extraction and parameter adjustment are realised through APFCN. On the basis of APFCN network, a full convolution network is introduced for end-to-end image semantic segmentation. Combining the advantages of convolution network in extracting image features and the advantages of short-term and short-term memory network in solving long-term dependence, an end-to-end hybrid depth network is constructed for image semantic multi-level segmentation. The experimental results show that the mean intersection over Union value and mean pixel accuracy value are higher than that of the literature method, both of which are increased by more than 3%, and the segmentation effect is good. The experimental results show that the mIoU value and MPA value of this method are high, and the segmentation effect is good.image	[Liu, Angxin] Jiangsu Univ, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yongbiao] Southeast Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China	Jiangsu University; Southeast University - China	Liu, AX (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Wuxi, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.	angwo55124@163.com							19	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA		2398-3396		IET CYBER PHYS SYST	IET Cyber Phys.

J	Martello, MV; Whittle, AJ; Oddo, PC; de Neufville, R				Martello, Michael V.; Whittle, Andrew J.; Oddo, Perry C.; de Neufville, Richard			Real options analysis for valuation of climate adaptation pathways with application to transit infrastructure	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						adaptation valuation; climate adaptation; coastal flood risk; infrastructure planning; real options analysis	SEA-LEVEL	Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of coastal flood events, posing risks to coastal communities and infrastructure. While regional climate adaptation investments can provide substantive flood protection, existing plans often neglect uncertainty in future climate conditions and adaptation performance, consequently neglecting the option value of flexibly implementing proposed projects. Addressing this gap, we develop and employ a generalizable real options analysis (ROA) valuation framework that considers how uncertainty in adaptation project costs, SLR, flood severity, and flood losses inform the full range of adaptation performance outcomes. We further propose and apply a novel, computationally efficient flood loss sampling algorithm to estimate the consequences of randomly arriving coastal flood events. We apply this ROA framework to assess the option value of flexibly timing adaptation investments over time, investigating an adaptation pathway proposed by the City of Boston from the perspective of the regional transit system manager. Our results suggest that flexible implementation can provide significant option value in the near- to mid-term (>30 years), with the highest option values under low-probability, high-consequence scenarios. Our results also suggest adaptation pathway performance in the latter half of the 21st century is most sensitive to uncertainty in SLR, flood loss estimates, and flood frequency, underscoring the importance of uncertainty quantification in the long-term valuation of adaptation investments.

Here, this work presents a plasmonic vesicle-mediated fusogenic immunoassay (PVFIA) comprising gold nanoparticle (GNP) encapsulating fusogenic polymeric vesicles (plasmonic vesicles; PVs) for the label-free and colorimetric detection of influenza A virus (IAV). The PVFIA combines two sequential assays: a biochip-based immunoassay for target-specific capture and a PV-induced fusion assay for color change upon the IAV-PV fusion complex formation. The PVFIA demonstrates excellent specificity in capturing the target IAV, while the fusion conditions and GNP induce a significant color change, enabling visual detection. The integration of two consecutive assays results in a low detection limit (100.7919 EID50 mL-1) and good reliability (0.9901), indicating sensitivity that is 104.208 times higher than conventional immunoassay. Leveraging the PV viral membrane fusion activity renders the PVFIA promising for point-of-care diagnostics through colorimetric detection. The innovative approach addresses the critical need for detecting active and intact virions with infectivity, providing a valuable tool with which to combat the spread of the virus.

However, the mechanisms behind the development of cachexia and its prognostic impact on immunotherapy efficacy are not fully understood.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively screened patients with advanced or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy. Among 183 patients, pre-treatment plasma samples were available from 100 patients. We defined cancer cachexia as weight loss of at least 5% during the past 6 months or weight loss of at least 2% and BMI <20. We analyzed 75 soluble immune mediators in pre-treatment plasma samples to explore the possible mechanisms behind the development of cancer cachexia. We also investigated whether cancer cachexia affects prognosis.Results: Among 100 patients, 35 had cancer cachexia. Logistic regression analysis identified ghrelin, c-reactive protein (CRP), pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), and osteopontin (OPN) as factors associated with cachexia. Patients with cachexia had worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), although we did not detect statistically significant differences. Analyzing the soluble immune mediators associated with cachexia, the combination of cachexia and PTX-3 or OPN expression levels was predictive for PFS and the combination of cachexia and CRP or OPN expression levels was predictive for OS.Conclusions: Pre-treatment ghrelin, CRP, PTX-3, and OPN may be associated with cachexia. Among patients with NSCLC who received PD-1/L1 inhibitor monotherapy, those with cachexia had worse survival than those without cachexia. Larger studies will be required to confirm our data and better understand the mechanisms behind the development of cachexia.

Current cancer imaging methods and treatment approaches in clinics frequently fall short of entirely curing cancer and can have severe side effects. Theranostic nanoparticles, however, have the potential to revolutionize effective cancer treatment and early cancer detection. The objective of this study is to show how magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and photoluminescent gold nanoclusters (MN-AuNCs) may be combined effectively to produce bimodal imaging nanoparticles that possess magnetic and optical properties and can be used for both magnetic resonance imaging and optical biopsy. These findings demonstrate that MN-AuNCs, when exposed to visible light, also have the capability to produce singlet oxygen, which is necessary for photodynamic therapy of cancer. In addition, it shows that they are non-toxic, accumulate inside the cells, and cause cell death during exposure to visible light. The creation of these MN-AuNCs offers a novel remedy for the current shortcomings in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Since they have both therapeutic and imaging capabilities, MN-AuNCs have the potential to improve patient outcomes while lowering the risk of negative side effects. Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles decorated with photoluminescent gold nanoclusters exhibit optical and magnetic properties that enable bimodal imaging (optical biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging). These nanoparticles can also generate singlet oxygen and be used as therapeutic agents in photodynamic cancer therapy. Thus, possession of diagnostic and therapeutic properties makes magnetic nanoparticles decorated with gold nanoclusters as potential theranostic nanoplatform.image	[Pleckaitis, Marijus; Butkiene, Greta; Venius, Jonas; Rotomskis, Ricardas] Natl Canc Inst, Biomed Phys Lab, P Baublio Str 3b, LT-08406 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Pleckaitis, Marijus] Vilnius Univ, Life Sci Ctr, Sauletekio Ave 7, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Karabanovas, Vitalijus] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Chem & Bioengn, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Venius, Jonas; Burkanas, Marius] Natl Canc Inst, Med Phys Dept, Santariskiu Str 1, LT-08660 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Grinciene, Giedre; Jagminas, Arunas] Ctr Phys Sci & Technol, State Res Inst, Sauletekio Ave 3, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rotomskis, Ricardas] Vilnius Univ, Phys Fac, Laser Res Ctr, Biophoton Grp, Sauletekio Ave 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania	National Cancer Institute - Lithuania; Vilnius University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; National Cancer Institute - Lithuania; Center for Physical Sciences & Technology - Lithuania; Vilnius University	Pleckaitis, M; Rotomskis, R (corresponding author), Natl Canc Inst, Biomed Phys Lab, P Baublio Str 3b, LT-08406 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Pleckaitis, M (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ, Life Sci Ctr, Sauletekio Ave 7, LT-10257 Vilnius, Lithuania.; Rotomskis, R (corresponding author), Vilnius Univ, Phys Fac, Laser Res Ctr, Biophoton Grp, Sauletekio Ave 9, LT-10222 Vilnius, Lithuania.	marijus.pleckaitis@nvi.lt; ricardas.rotomskis@nvi.lt	Butkiene, Greta/I-8886-2017	Butkiene, Greta/0000-0003-3244-4979; Jagminas, Arunas/0000-0003-0191-8588					65	0	0	4	4	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	2196-7350			ADV MATER INTERFACES	Adv.

This picture is unsettled by offering a more tenuous account of the state of siege, showing that normal laws and processes can be a constitutive dimension of modern exceptional regimes. Through an ethnography of a permanent space of exception in India, I argue that emergency regimes as forms of structural injustice are marked by affective intensities and anger directed against state power. Irom Sharmila's 16-year hunger strike in the state of Manipur was one such affective act that challenged state authority. The police mitigated this challenge through the minutia of rules and processes targeting the protester's body. The state's legal response to the hunger strike showed that emergency powers are better understood not by the sovereign's fantasy of absolutism but as the messy affective mediation of the normal and exceptional.

Vitiligo poses significant challenges for healthcare professionals in terms of treatment selection. Autologous cell transplant has emerged as a promising modality for managing vitiligo, with cultured and noncultured transplants being considered when determining the patient's treatment approach. There is little knowledge and literature on the subject, so we analyze the different studies.MethodUsing online medical literature databases and the PRISMA guidelines, six out of 60 articles met the acceptance criteria to be analyzed, emphasizing the lack of current literature on this subject.ResultsAutologous cell transplant achieves excellent pigmentation rates for many body parts. We found that cultivated cells had better results than noncultivated ones. Both types of treatments could pigment 80% or more where needed.ConclusionThis review highlights the importance of autologous cell transplant as a new and reliable tool for the treatment of stable segmental vitiligo, cultured transplants being the most effective. By employing autologous cell transplant, the repigmentation rate is notably high and consistently achievable. Although its cost and logistical complexities hinder the current accessibility to this therapy, efforts are being made to enhance its availability, and its scope is expected to expand further.

Short-term function and immune-protection of microencapsulated adult porcine islets with alginate incorporating CXCL12 in healthy and diabetic non-human primates without systemic immune suppression: A pilot study	XENOTRANSPLANTATION			English	Article; Early Access						alginate; chemokine CXCL12; immunosuppression; microencapsulated; porcine islets	OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION RATE; BETA-CELL REPLACEMENT; PANCREATIC-ISLETS; IN-VITRO; TRANSPLANTATION; SURVIVAL; MODEL; BIOCOMPATIBILITY; MECHANISMS; PERIFUSION	Replacement of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells by islet transplantation offers a functional cure for type-1 diabetes (T1D). We recently demonstrated that a clinical grade alginate micro-encapsulant incorporating the immune-repellent chemokine and pro-survival factor CXCL12 could protect and sustain the integrity and function of autologous islets in healthy non-human primates (NHPs) without systemic immune suppression. In this pilot study, we examined the impact of the CXCL12 micro encapsulant on the function and inflammatory and immune responses of xenogeneic islets transplanted into the omental tissue bilayer sac (OB; n = 4) and diabetic (n = 1) NHPs. Changes in the expression of cytokines after implantation were limited to 2-6-fold changes in blood, most of which did not persist over the first 4 weeks after implantation. Flow cytometry of PBMCs following transplantation showed minimal changes in IFN & gamma; or TNF & alpha; expression on xenoantigen-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells compared to unstimulated cells, and these occurred mainly in the first 4 weeks. Microbeads were readily retrievable for assessment at day 90 and day 180 and at retrieval were without microscopic signs of degradation or foreign body responses (FBR). In vitro and immunohistochemistry studies of explanted microbeads indicated the presence of functional xenogeneic islets at day 30 post transplantation in all biopsied NHPs. These results from a small pilot study revealed that CXCL12-microencapsulated xenogeneic islets abrogate inflammatory and adaptive immune responses to the xenograft. This work paves the way toward future larger scale studies of the transplantation of alginate microbeads with CXCL12 and porcine or human stem cell-derived beta cells or allogeneic islets into diabetic NHPs without systemic immunosuppression.

J	Wang, Q; Wang, Z				Wang, Qi; Wang, Zhe			Serpin family H member 1 and its related collagen gene network are the potential prognostic biomarkers and anticancer targets for glioma	JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR TOXICOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						glioma; immune checkpoints; immune infiltration; immunotherapy; prognosis	HSP47; CANCER; CELLS; MACROPHAGES; SURVIVAL; GROWTH	Serpin family H member 1 (SERPINH1) is responsible for encoding the protein known as heat shock protein 47, which functions as a molecular chaperone specific to collagen (COL). This protein has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for COL-related disorders. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of SERPINH1 in the tumorigenicity of gliomas. To achieve this, we utilized various bioinformatics tools to analyze gene expression, overall survival, protein-protein interactions, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database revealed that SERPINH1 and four COL family members (COL1A1, COL3A1, COL4A1, and COL4A2) expression are significantly upregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal nontumor tissues. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses exhibited that SERPINH1 is implicated in the establishment and degradation of COL-containing extracellular matrix (ECM), focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction in glioma. SERPINH1 is an independent prognostic factor, exhibiting a positive association with the augmentation of neutrophils and macrophages, as well as the manifestation of immune checkpoint molecules within glioma. Experimental assessments conducted both in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that the suppression of SERPINH1 impeded the migratory, invasive, and proliferative capacities of glioma cells, while concurrently fostering cellular apoptosis. Consequently, SERPINH1 emerges as an oncogenic gene and an independent prognostic marker for glioma, potentially facilitating the advancement of immunotherapeutic interventions for the treatment of glioma.

In the present work, a dual junction heterostructure (FePc/L-R/CN) is designed by anchoring iron phthalocyanine (FePc)/MXene (L-Ti3C2-R, R -OH or F) heterojunction on g-C3N4 nanosheet substrates for electrocatalysis. The unidirectional cascade electron transfer (g-C3N4 -> L-Ti3C2-R. FePc) induced by the dual junction of FePc/L-Ti3C2-R and L-Ti3C2-R/g-C3N4 makes the Fe center electron-rich and therefore facilitates the adsorption of O-2 in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, the electron transfer between FePc and MXene is facilitated by the axial Fe -O coordination interaction of Fe with the OH in alkalized MXene nanosheets (L-Ti3C2-OH). As a result, FePc/L-OH/CN exhibits an impressive ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.92 V, which is superior over the catalysts with a single junction and the state-of-the-art Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.85 V). This work provides a broad idea for deep regulation of electronic state by the unidirectional cascade multi-step charge transfer and can be extended to other proton-coupled electron transfer processes.

Data were collected from 520 Chinese adolescents (M-age = 12.75 years, SDage = 1.48 years) and their mothers during the COVID-19 school closure and one year after return-to-school. Results indicated that maternal involvement in both education and leisure activities predicted more consistent adolescents' daily routines during the school closure period and then contributed to their more consistent daily routines after return-to-school, resulting in less psychological maladjustment and better academic outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of maternal involvement and daily routines in the context of COVID-19.

Here, self-hybridized BiOBr0.5I0.5 with a flower-like structure composed of 2D nanosheets is assembled and used as PIBs anode. According to the systematic theoretical calculations, the unbalanced charge distribution between Br and I atoms induces an intensified internal electric field and a wide van der Waals gap; while the decreasing of electron polarons caused by the hybridized structure improves the stability and electronic conductivity of the system. Moreover, the K+ ion uptake induces an energetic evolution in polaronic states in the BiOBr0.5I0.5 crystal skeleton, whereby the dynamic K+ ion-halogen atoms correlation in situ forms hole-like polarons, which substantially promotes K+ ion diffusion kinetics and the corresponding reaction kinetics during charge/discharge processes, imparting significant implications for the design of high-performance energy storage electrode materials by engineering the interface interaction and electronic structure. Therefore, with this atomic orbital self-hybridized structure, the K+ ion diffusion kinetics and the corresponding reaction kinetics during the charge/discharge process are both enhanced remarkably, thus enabling a high electrochemical performance of 155 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 over 4000 cycles in PIBs with the BiOBr0.5I0.5 as the anode. The self-hybridization of BiOBr0.5I0.5 induces the intensified internal electric field and wider van der Waals gap, providing a fast diffusion path for K+ ion. Combining the decreasing of electron polarons induced by the hybridized structure and the in-situ formation of hole-like polarons caused by the dynamic K+ ion-halogen atoms correlation, the BiOBr0.5I0.5 exhibits a high electrochemical performance in potassium-ion batteries.image	[Zhou, Xiaoyun; Qi, Jing; Zhou, Dan; Wu, Tianli] Henan Univ, Sch Future Technol, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China; [Li, Tao; Xu, Ying] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Mat & Energy, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenlong] Shandong Univ, Inst Frontier & Interdisciplinary Sci, Sci Ctr Mat Creat & Energy Convers, Shandong Prov Key Lab Sci Mat Creat & Energy Conve, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China	Henan University; Lanzhou University; Shandong University	Wu, TL (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Sch Future Technol, Kaifeng 475004, Peoples R China.; Xu, Y (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Mat & Energy, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.; Yang, WL (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Inst Frontier & Interdisciplinary Sci, Sci Ctr Mat Creat & Energy Convers, Shandong Prov Key Lab Sci Mat Creat & Energy Conve, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.	tianliwu@henu.edu.cn; wlyang@sdu.edu.cn; xuying@lzu.edu.cn	Wu, Tianli/H-7269-2016	Wu, Tianli/0000-0002-1226-9088	National Natural Science Foundation of China [52001151]; Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province of China [62460082161012]; Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province [202300410068]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2022J05104]; Postdoctoral Foundation of Henan Province [201902029]; Science and Technology Foundation for Youths of Gansu Province [21JR7RA518]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province of China; Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Postdoctoral Foundation of Henan Province; Science and Technology Foundation for Youths of Gansu Province	This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52001151), the Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province of China (62460082161012), Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (202300410068) and Fujian Province (2022J05104), Postdoctoral Foundation of Henan Province (201902029), and the Science and Technology Foundation for Youths of Gansu Province (21JR7RA518).		45	0	0	4	4	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1616-301X	1616-3028		ADV FUNCT MATER	Adv.

In general, hybrid algorithms involve low-cost high-order accurate schemes in smooth regions and non-oscillatory shock-capturing schemes in the vicinity of discontinuities. Troubled-cell indicators which measure the smoothness of the solution play a significant role in the efficiency of hybrid algorithms. This article proposes a new troubled-cell indicator utilising the smoothness indicators of WENO schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The proposed troubled-cell indicators are simple, efficient, effective, and are used to construct three new adaptive WENO algorithms of high-order accuracy. The hybrid algorithms developed are independent of the order and type of the WENO reconstruction. For demonstration, we have considered the fifth and seventh order WENO-Z reconstruction. The first two algorithms have comparable accuracy and resolution of the solution across discontinuities to that of the WENO-Z scheme but at a less computational cost. The third algorithm ensures the convergence of the proposed scheme to the correct entropy solution when applied to a hyperbolic conservation law with non-convex flux for which the WENO schemes fail. We have performed several 1D and 2D numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and their performance compared with the WENO-Z schemes. The proposed algorithms are efficient and take 30%-75% less computational time than the WENO-Z schemes while retaining the advantages of WENO-Z schemes. 1. Simple, efficient and effective troubled-cell indicators are developed. 2. Three new adaptive WENO algorithms are proposed. 3. First two algorithms maintain the WENO scheme's accuracy while being less costly. 4. Third algorithm ensures the convergence to entropy solution of the WENO scheme.image	[Arun, K.

A deeper knowledge of such states is mandatory for modeling the charge migration dynamics. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TD-DFT) electronic dynamics simulations are employed to explicitly observe the electronic density time-evolution upon photo-excitation. Asymmetrically substituted indenotetracene molecules, given their potential application as n-type semiconductors in organic photovoltaic materials, are here investigated. Effects of substituents with different electron-donating characters are analyzed in terms of the overall electronic energy spacing and resulting ultrafast CT dynamics through linear response (LR-)TD-DFT and RT-TD-DFT based approaches. The combination of the computational techniques here employed provided direct access to the electronic density reorganization in time and to its spatial and rational representation in terms of molecular orbital occupation time evolution. Such results can be exploited to design peculiar directional charge dynamics, crucial when photoactive materials are used for light-harvesting applications.

Still, their exact modes of action and dependencies on other regulatory aspects remain elusive. Since TFs act cell type-specific and each TF has its own characteristics, untangling their regulatory interactions from an experimental point of view is laborious and convoluted. Thus, there is an ongoing development of computational tools that estimate transcription factor activity (TFA) from a variety of data modalities, either based on a mapping of TFs to their putative target genes or in a genome-wide, gene-unspecific fashion. These tools can help to gain insights into TF regulation and to prioritize candidates for experimental validation. We want to give an overview of available computational tools that estimate TFA, illustrate examples of their application, debate common result validation strategies, and discuss assumptions and concomitant limitations.

By virtue of a differential inequality technique, an upper bound of the blow-up time is obtained with a bounded initial energy if m < p and some additional conditions are satisfied. For m = 1, in particular, the blow-up result with high initial energy also is showed by constructing a new control functional and combining energy inequalities with the concavity argument. Moreover, an estimate for the lower bound of the blow-up time is investigated. Finally, the energy decay estimate is proved as well. These results improve and complement some recent works.

This is the basis for the ecological "compatibility hypothesis" for host choice. The inability of mistletoes to penetrate a host and connect to its vascular system is the competing "immunity hypothesis". Epi-parasites would have to transpire faster than their host mistletoe, which must transpire faster than its host. Therefore, epi-parasites should be able to parasitise their host's host. I surveyed epi-parasite host choice at a site and found this did not happen. Globally about a quarter of all epi-parasites are obligate. This supports the immunity hypothesis.

Hermetic grain storage bags offer an effective pesticide-free way to protect stored grain against fungal and insect infestation. We evaluated articles indexed in the Web of Science that included experiments comparing the storage efficacy of conventional and hermetic storage bags based on grain germination rate, insect infestation, physical damage, mycotoxin contamination, and changes in weight and moisture content. Compared with grain stored in hermetic bags, grain stored in conventional bags lost 3.6-fold more seed viability, contained 42-fold more insects, had 11-fold more physical damage, and lost 23-fold more grain weight, while grain moisture levels were similar for both hermetic and conventional storage bags. Mycotoxin contamination levels were not as frequently assessed. Levels could be low in grain stored in both types of bags, or levels could be low in hermetic bags and significantly higher in conventional bags. The improved properties of grain stored in hermetic bags can increase food security and household income by providing safe storage options for maintaining seed germinability, and for consumption and/or sale when food supplies are high, or when prices are low. Hermetic bags are economically feasible for use by subsistence farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa for grain for household consumption and for carrying-over seed for planting in the next season. Additional studies are needed to verify the mycotoxin contamination results and to determine if there are differences in functional food characteristics, e.g. flavor and cooking properties, that have not been as comprehensively studied. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

'Evolutionary poker': an agent-based model of interactome emergence and epistasis tested against Lenski's long-term <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> experiments	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Review; Early Access						adaptation; Dacque's principle of Zeitsignaturen; Dollo's law; epistasis; historical contingency; interactome; long-term evolution experiments; model; punctuated equilibrium	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; MOLECULAR EVOLUTION; KEY INNOVATION; BREAST-CANCER; ADAPTATION; SELECTION; NETWORKS; COMPLEMENTARITY; POPULATION; PENETRANCE	A simple agent-based model is presented that produces results matching the experimental data found by Lenski's group for <= 50,000 generations of Escherichia coli bacteria under continuous selective pressure. Although various mathematical models have been devised previously to model the Lenski data, the present model has advantages in terms of overall simplicity and conceptual accessibility. The model also clearly illustrates a number of features of the evolutionary process that are otherwise not obvious, such as the roles of epistasis and historical contingency in adaptation and why evolution is time irreversible ('Dollo's law'). The reason for this irreversibility is that genomes become increasingly integrated or organized, and this organization becomes a novel selective factor itself, against which future generations must compete. Selection for integrated or synergistic networks, systems or sets of mutations or traits, not for individual mutations, confers themain adaptive advantage. The result is a punctuated form of evolution that follows a logarithmic occurrence probability, in which evolution proceeds very quickly when interactomes begin to form but which slows as interactomes become more robust and the difficulty of integrating new mutations increases. Sufficient parameters exist in the game to suggest not only how equilibrium or stasis is reached but also the conditions in which it will be punctuated, the factors governing the rate at which genomic organization occurs and novel traits appear, and how population size, genome size and gene variability affect these.

In nature, it is required for the biosynthesis of teichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria, which is an appealing target epitope for the development of new vaccines. Here, a cell-free multi-enzyme cascade was developed to synthetize nucleotide-activated glycerol from the inexpensive and readily available substrates cytidine and glycerol. The cascade comprises five recombinant enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli that were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. As part of the cascade, ATP is regenerated in situ from polyphosphate to reduce synthesis costs. The enzymatic cascade was characterized at the laboratory scale, and the products were analyzed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC)-UV and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). After the successful synthesis had been confirmed, a design-of-experiments approach was used to screen for optimal operation conditions (temperature, pH value and MgCl2 concentration). Overall, a substrate conversion of 89 % was achieved with respect to the substrate cytidine. A multi-enzyme cascade for the cell-free, one-pot synthesis of CDP-glycerol has been developed. Through a design-of-experiments approach, the yield of the cascade was increased from 10 to 89 % with respect to cytidine as a substrate. The final product titer after a batch time of 24 h was 31.2 mM CDP-glycerol.image	[Alcala-Orozco, E.

Here, ultrafast photoinduced dynamics in a DA-type layered MOF that exhibits a charge-transfer (CT)-type phase transition are reported: (NPr4)(2)[Fe-2(Cl(2)An)(3)], where NPr4+ = tetra-n-propylammonium and Cl(2)An(2-) = 2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxo-1,4-benzoquinonate. At room temperature (300 K: RT), ultrafast photoinduced CT between the Fe and Cl(2)An ions induces a sensitive change in the state associated with the valence instability from a single-chain, electron-correlated state to a new photoinduced, structurally modulated state. In the photoinduced state, two absorption bands are observed, one on the higher-energy side of the CT band and the other in the mid-IR range. This strongly implies that the local inversion center on the Cl(2)An ion that exists in the initial state disappears instantly upon photoexcitation, causing an ultrafast change in the lattice structure due to the softening of rigid bonds. This has never been realized in thermal excitation. These findings demonstrate that a new electronic state with a unique lattice structure-i.e., a photoinduced hidden state-appears in this MOF system at ultra-high speed (within 110 fs) upon photoexcitation at RT.

Besides, the oligonucleotides can adopt various non-canonical secondary structures. These are hairpins, cruciforms, triplexes, quadruplexes (G4), i-motifs etc. G4s are usually formed by the guanine rich oligonucleotides and are found in both DNA and RNA. G4s are more frequently distributed in telomeres, promoter oncogenes, immunoglobulin switch regions, ribosomal DNA etc. Recently, it has been established that G4s are intriguingly connected with different human diseases including cancer. Stabilization of G4s by designed molecules or drugs impedes the transcription of several oncogenes and also creates encumbrance to the telomere biogenesis which is very important in impediment of cancer. G4 is treated as an important molecular target in the discovery of anti-cancer drugs. Among the G4 targeting molecules, peptides draw sincere attention due to its small size, simple synthetic methodology, low cytotoxicity and cellular permeability. In this review, our main discussion revolves around the formation of G4, distribution of G4 in genome, structurally diverse peptides (linear, cyclic, branch, conjugated) having potential to target G4 structures and its future perspectives. In this review, our discussion mainly focused on structurally diverse peptides (linear, cyclic, branch, conjugated) reported in literature between the years 2000 to 2022 having potential to target non-canonical G-quadruplex (G4) nucleic acid structures and its biomedical applications.image	[Basak, Shubhanwita; Biswas, Soumi; Naskar, Jishu] Univ Kalyani, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Nadia 741235, West Bengal, India	Kalyani University	Naskar, J (corresponding author), Univ Kalyani, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Nadia 741235, West Bengal, India.	jishunaskar@gmail.com			University of Kalyani for URS fellowship; Department of Science and Technology (DST) [EEQ/2022/000738]; UGC-DAE [CRS/2021-22/04/634]	University of Kalyani for URS fellowship; Department of Science and Technology (DST)(Department of Science & Technology (India)); UGC-DAE	Shubhanwita Basak acknowledges University of Kalyani for URS fellowship.

This study examined the impact of demographic, clinical, and technology-related factors on long-term NIV adverse events in a large cohort of children using long-term NIV.Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective review of all children who initiated long-term NIV in the province of Alberta, Canada, from January 2005 to September 2014, and followed until December 2015. Inclusion criteria were children who had used NIV for 3 months or more and had at least one follow-up visit with the NIV programs.Results: We identified 507 children who initiated NIV at a median age of 7.5 (interquartile range: 8.6) years and 93% of them reported at least one NIV-related adverse event during the initial follow-up visit. Skin injury (20%) and unintentional air leaks (19%) were reported more frequently at the initial visit. Gastrointestinal symptoms, midface hypoplasia, increased drooling, aspiration and pneumothorax were rarely reported (<5%). Younger age and underlying conditions such as Down syndrome, achondroplasia, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy were early predictors of unintentional air leak. Younger age also predicted child sleep disruption in the short term and ongoing parental sleep disruption. Obesity was a risk factor for persistent nasal symptoms. Mask type was not a significant predictor for NIV-related short- or long-term complications.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that NIV-related complications are frequent. Appropriate mask-fitting and headgear adaptation, and a proactive approach to early detection may help to reduce adverse events.

Trichosanthin (TCS) as a class of ribosome-inactivating proteins is widely studied in tumor treatment. However, the immunogenicity can induce the formation of ADA, which can cause hypersensitivity reactions and neutralize the efficacy of TCS, thus limiting its clinical application in cancer therapy. Here, a promising solution to this issue is presented by co-administration of the rapamycin nanoparticles and TCS. PEGylated rapamycin amphiphilic molecule is designed and synthesized as a prodrug and a delivery carrier, which can self-assemble into a nanoparticle system with encapsulation of free rapamycin, a hydrophobic drug. It is found that co-injection of the PEGylated rapamycin nanoparticles and TCS could mitigate the formation of anti-TCS antibody via inducing durable immunological tolerance. Importantly, the combination of TCS and the rapamycin nanoparticles has an enhanced effect on inhibit the growth of breast cancer. This work provides a promising approach for protein toxin-based anticancer therapy and for promoting the clinical translation. Co-injection of the PEGylated rapamycin nanoparticles and a protein toxin (trichosanthin) can mitigate the formation of anti-drug antibody via inducing durable antigen-specific tolerance. The combination of trichosanthin and the rapamycin nanoparticles yields an enhanced effect to inhibit the growth of breast tumor.image	[Chang, Ya; Zou, Chenming; Zeng, Ping; Shen, Yuanyuan; Guo, Shengrong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Pharm, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Chang, Ya; Xiong, Wei; Hou, Jiazhen; Muhitdinov, Bahtiyor; Huang, Yongzhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, State Key Lab Drug Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wei] Guangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Artemisinin Res Ctr, Guangzhou 510450, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Wei; Huang, Yongzhuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Zhongshan Inst Drug Discovery, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, Zhongshan 528437, Peoples R China; [Hou, Jiazhen] Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Chinese Mat Med, 138 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Muhitdinov, Bahtiyor] Uzbek Acad Sci, Inst Bioorgan Chem, Tashkent 100125, Uzbekistan; [Huang, Yongzhuo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China	Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, CAS; Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, CAS; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine; Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan; Sadykov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS	Guo, SR (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Pharm, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.; Huang, YZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Mat Med, State Key Lab Drug Res, Shanghai 201203, Peoples R China.	yzhuang@simm.ac.cn; srguo@sjtu.edu.cn	Huang, Yongzhuo/A-4688-2013	Huang, Yongzhuo/0000-0001-7067-8915	National Key Research and Development Program of China (China) [2021YFE0103100, 2021YFC2400600]; NFSC (China) [81925035, 82073776, 82050410361]; Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (Highlevel new RD institute) [2019B090904008]; Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (High-level Innovative Research Institute) [2021B0909050003]; Zhongshan Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology [LJ2021001, CXTD2022011]; Chinese Pharmaceutical Association-Yiling Pharm Joint Grants (China) [CPAYLJ201901]	National Key Research and Development Program of China (China); NFSC (China)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (Highlevel new RD institute); Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (High-level Innovative Research Institute); Zhongshan Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology; Chinese Pharmaceutical Association-Yiling Pharm Joint Grants (China)	This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFE0103100 and 2021YFC2400600, China), the NFSC (81925035, 82073776, and 82050410361, China), the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association-Yiling Pharm Joint Grants (CPAYLJ201901, China), the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (Highlevel new R&D institute 2019B090904008, High-level Innovative Research Institute 2021B0909050003), and the Zhongshan Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology (LJ2021001 and CXTD2022011).		31	0	0	3	3	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1613-6810	1613-6829		SMALL	Small	2023 SEP 13	2023										10.1002/smll.202303916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202303916		SEP 2023	12	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics	R5OO0	37705134				2023-10-18	WOS:001064846100001

Patients and Methods A prospective multi-institutional study was conducted, with ethics board approval; February 2022-March 2023. Recruitment was of 120 consecutive consenting adult patients undergoing semi-rigid URS and/or flexible ureterorenoscopy (FURS) for urolithiasis or diagnostic purposes. Retrograde, fluoroscopy-guided insertion of a 0.036-cm (0.014 '') pressure guidewire (COMET (TM) II, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) to the renal pelvis was performed. Baseline and continuous ureteroscopic IRP was recorded, alongside relevant operative variables. A 30-day follow-up was completed. Descriptive statistics were applied to IRP traces, with mean (SD) and maximum values and variance reported. Relationships between IRP and technical variables, and IRP and clinical outcome were interrogated using the chi-square test and independent samples t-test. Results A total of 430 pressure traces were analysed from 120 patient episodes. The mean (SD) baseline IRP was 16.45 (5.99) mmHg and the intraoperative IRP varied by technique. The mean (SD) IRP during semi-rigid URS with gravity irrigation was 34.93 (11.66) mmHg. FURS resulted in variable IRP values: from a mean (SD) of 26.78 (5.84) mmHg (gravity irrigation; 12/14-F ureteric access sheath [UAS]) to 87.27 (66.85) mmHg (200 mmHg pressurised-bag irrigation; 11/13-F UAS). The highest single pressure peak was 334.2 mmHg, during retrograde pyelography. Six patients (5%) developed postoperative urosepsis; these patients had significantly higher IRPs during FURS (mean [SD] 81.7 [49.52] mmHg) than controls (38.53 [22.6] mmHg; P < 0.001).

The redox unbalance of RXS is firmly implicated in an assortment of physiological and pathological disorders, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the intricate nature and multifactorial dependence of RXS pose challenges in comprehending and precisely modulating their biological behavior. Nanomaterials with distinct characteristics and biofunctions offer promising avenues for generating or scavenging RXS to maintain redox homeostasis and advance disease therapy. This minireview provides a tutorial summary of the relevant chemistry and specific mechanisms governing different RXS, focusing on cellular metabolic regulation, stress responses, and the role of nanomedicine in RXS generation and elimination. The challenges associated with chemically regulating RXS for diverse disease treatments are further discussed along with the future prospects, aiming to facilitate the clinical translation of RXS-based nanomedicine and open new avenues for improved therapeutic interventions.

However, intracellular copper, when improperly buffered, can also lead to cell death. Given the growing interest in the use of copper in the presence of the ionophore elesclomol (CuES) for the treatment of gliomas, we investigated the effect of this compound on the surround parenchyma-namely neurons and astrocytes in vitro. Here, we show that astrocytes were highly sensitive to CuES toxicity while neurons were surprisingly resistant, a vulnerability profile that is opposite of what has been described for zinc and other toxins. Bolstering these findings, a human astrocytic cell line was similarly sensitive to CuES. Modifications of cellular metabolic pathways implicated in cuproptosis, a form of copper-regulated cell death, such as inhibition of mitochondrial respiration or knock-down of ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), did not block CuES toxicity to astrocytes. CuES toxicity was also unaffected by inhibitors of apoptosis, necrosis or ferroptosis. However, we did detect the presence of lipid peroxidation products in CuES-treated astrocytes, indicating that oxidative stress is a mediator of CuES-induced glial toxicity. Indeed, treatment with anti-oxidants mitigated CuES-induced cell death in astrocytes indicating that oxidative stress is a mediator of CuES-induced glial toxicity. Lastly, prior induction of metallothioneins 1 and 2 in astrocytes with zinc plus pyrithione was strikingly protective against CuES toxicity. As neurons express high levels of metallothioneins basally, these results may partially account for their resistance to CuES toxicity. These results demonstrate a unique toxic response to copper in glial cells which contrasts with the cell selectivity profile of zinc, another biologically relevant metal.

To improve the encryption level, the exploration of organic materials with tunable phosphorescence and afterglow features is in urgent need. Hereby, a series of long-lived organic systems with RTP is developed by incorporating benzocarbazole derivatives into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix (BCz@PVA). Notably, the BCz@PVA film exhibits outstanding RTP behavior with an ultralong phosphorescence lifetime (& tau;p) of 2.09 s, high phosphorescence quantum yield (& phi;p) of 46.335%, and an ultra-long afterglow duration of 15 s. Moreover, the BCz@PVA film maintains excellent RTP performance even after being placed in ambient conditions for 60 days. Theoretical calculations reveal that the excellent RTP performance of BCz@PVA film is attributed to the stronger intermolecular interactions, the smaller energy gap (& UDelta;Est) between the singlet and triplet states, and stable molecular stacking mode. Furthermore, color-tunable photoluminescence (PL), distinct & tau;p, and afterglow duration are successfully achieved by adjusting the position of the Br substituent on the benzene ring. Based on their diverse RTP performances and excellent stability, the corresponding BCz@PVA film provides successful application for multi-level high-security anti-counterfeiting and information protection. The benzocarbazole derivative is embedded in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix, and the doped film exhibits ultra-long phosphorescence lifetime (2.03 s) and afterglow duration (15 s). Furthermore, the controllable phosphorescence characteristics are achieved by adjusting the position of the bromine substituent on the benzene ring, and the significant controllable afterglow duration characteristics pave the way for multiple dynamic anti-counterfeiting applications.image	[Hou, Lihui; Wang, Guohao; Huang, Wenlong; Zhu, Xuanyu; Liu, Haozhe; Nie, Lin; Wang, Ting] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Mat & Chem & Chem Engn, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xue] Chengdu Univ, Inst Adv Mat Deformat & Damage Multiscale, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu 610106, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenfei] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Phys & Optoelect Engn, Shenzhen Key Lab Laser Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jianbei; Xu, Xuhui] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Mat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Adv Mat Yunnan Prov, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China	Chengdu University of Technology; Chengdu University; Shenzhen University; Kunming University of Science & Technology	Wang, T (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Mat & Chem & Chem Engn, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.; Yu, X (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ, Inst Adv Mat Deformat & Damage Multiscale, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu 610106, Peoples R China.	yuyu6593@126.com; wangtkm@foxmail.com			National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U2241236, 1220041913]; Sichuan Natural Science Foundation [2022YFH0108, 2022JDJQ0030]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2022QNRC001]; Project of Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation [202101AT070126]	National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Natural Science Foundation; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST; Project of Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation	This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (U2241236, 1220041913), Sichuan Natural Science Foundation (2022YFH0108, 2022JDJQ0030), Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2022QNRC001), and the Project of Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (202101AT070126).		38	0	0	11	11	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	2195-1071			ADV OPT MATER	Adv.

The effective use of high-volume image data can significantly improve the monitoring of production and service systems in terms of speed, accuracy, and cost. Adopting an image-based approach is better than relying on operator-based solutions, and it offers new perspectives for process monitoring. Image processing can involve extracting features to identify, classify, detect, and cluster. Although there are several transformations to extract features from images, the Fourier method cannot consider the concurrency of frequency and time data, and the wavelet method only considers two specific directions. In multidimensional transforms, the optimal method can provide more information using fewer coefficients. The contourlet transform has advantages such as multiresolution, localization, critical sampling, directionality, and anisotropy. This research investigates the advantages of applying the contourlet transform to images and using data in a generalized likelihood ratio control chart. The results show that this method is more accurate than others because it can examine various directions in images. The proposed methodology algorithm is also presented in this study.

The catalytic platform (Fe3O4@PDA@Cu) was fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared, Energy-dispersive X-ray, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Thermogravimetric Analysis. The catalytic activity of the Fe3O4@PDA@Cu nanocatalyst was investigated in a green and effective synthesis of click reaction by applying three-component reactions of azide, alkyne, and benzyl surrogates in water, providing the corresponding 1,2,3-triazoles in high yield. Furthermore, the present nanocatalyst could be easily separated by an external magnet and reused several times without considerable reduction of its catalytic efficiency. Operational simplicity, environmental friendliness, economical processing, and easy workup are the features of the present protocol. A highly efficient and reusable nanocatalyst for click reactions has been developed by immobilizing Cu(OAc)2 salt to polydopamine-coated magnetite. The catalyst was characterized using various techniques and found to be effective for synthesizing 1,2,3-triazoles in high yield under green conditions in water. The process is simple, environmentally friendly, and economical, and the nanocatalyst can be easily separated and reused without significant loss of efficiency.image	[Kwak, Soo-Jung; Oh, Sang-Sun; Ahn, Yong-Hyun; Kim, Seung-Hoi] Dankook Univ, Dept Chem, 119 Dandaero, Cheonan 31116, South Korea	Dankook University	Ahn, YH; Kim, SH (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Chem, 119 Dandaero, Cheonan 31116, South Korea.	yhahn@dankook.ac.kr; kimsemail@dankook.ac.kr			Not applicable	Not applicable	Not applicable		66	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	2365-6549			CHEMISTRYSELECT	ChemistrySelect	SEP 13	2023	8	34							e202302515	10.1002/slct.202302515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/slct.202302515			9	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry	Q9QL3					2023-10-18	WOS:001060789000001

Our objective was to determine the frequency of undeclared ARV drug use by blood donors with altered HIV markers.Study Design and Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of donations that were tested for HIV antibody (ab), antigen (ag), and RNA by chemiluminescent immunoassay and nucleic acid screening tests. Positive samples were retested and were subjected to ARV drug testing by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results Of 345,252 blood donations, 361 (0.1%) were positive on initial testing. Samples from 296 (81.9%) of these donations were available for further analysis. The presence of HIV ab/ag and/or RNA was confirmed in 83 (28.0%) of these samples. All 296 bloods were subjected to ARV testing. The ARV drug lamivudine, at 11.3 and 6.7 ng/mL, was detected in 2 of 83 (2.4%) donations that were HIV positive. Other drugs were not detected.Conclusion Unreported ARV usage was identified in two candidates for blood donation. More intensive efforts to educate donors about disclosure and to investigate the extent of this phenomenon in Brazil are needed.

We confirm previous findings of convergence in pre-transfer income during the 1970s and 1980s but present new evidence of rising inequality since the early 1990s, which is characterized by bipolarization. Cross-county differences in education and industry composition explain much of this recent trend, which almost disappears in post-transfer incomes. Among the various government transfer programs, medical benefits play the greatest role in making the distribution less unequal.

By using a one-step gamma irradiation, the amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites were prepared from zinc acetate dihydrate, ethylenediamine, and carbon dots. The impacts of ethylenediamine and carbon dots on the performance of the supercapacitor were examined. The highest specific capacitance obtained in this work was 179.9 F g-1 along with an excellent 91 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. To clarify the mechanistic insights on the improved supercapacitor performance, an electrochemical analysis was performed, and it was found that amine incorporation improved the diffusion process of charge transfer, which led to better charge storage and higher capacitance. We have demonstrated that gamma irradiation is a simple and efficient method for creating electro-active materials based on amine-incorporated zinc complex/carbon dots composites for supercapacitors with improved performance and electrochemical properties. Novel zinc complex/carbon dots composites were prepared using gamma irradiation. Addition of ethylenediamine improved the specific capacitance by 290.6 %. A specific capacitance of 179.9 F g-1 was obtained and a capacitance retention of 91 % was obtained after 10,000 cycles. Gamma irradiation produced unique composite materials for supercapacitor electrode.+image	[Phetcharee, Kulpriya; Jorn-am, Thanapat; Pholauyphon, Wasinee; Sirisit, Natee; Paoprasert, Peerasak] Thammasat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Kwamman, Tanagorn] Thailand Inst Nucl Technol, Ongkharak 26120, Nakhon Nayok, Thailand; [Manyam, Jedsada; Chanthad, Chalathorn] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Nanotechnol Ctr NANOTEC, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Paoprasert, Peerasak] Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Petrochem & Mat Technol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand	Thammasat University; Asian Institute of Technology; National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Nanotechnology Center (NANOTEC); Chulalongkorn University	Paoprasert, P (corresponding author), Thammasat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Chem, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.; Paoprasert, P (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Petrochem & Mat Technol, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.	peerasak@tu.ac.th			Thammasat University Research Unit in Carbon Materials; Green Chemistry Innovations; Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology (TINT); Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI), Thailand; Hub of Talent: Sustainable Materials for Circular Economy, National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT); Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (TGIST) [SCA-CO-2559-2322-TH]; National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA); Science Achievement Scholarship of Thailand; Commission of Higher Education; Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation; TU-NSTDA Excellent Research Graduate Scholarship [T1-64-01]	Thammasat University Research Unit in Carbon Materials; Green Chemistry Innovations; Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology (TINT); Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI), Thailand; Hub of Talent: Sustainable Materials for Circular Economy, National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT); Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology (TGIST); National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA); Science Achievement Scholarship of Thailand; Commission of Higher Education; Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation; TU-NSTDA Excellent Research Graduate Scholarship	This work is supported by the funding under Thammasat University Research Unit in Carbon Materials and Green Chemistry Innovations and TINT to University project, the Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology (TINT), Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation (MHESI), Thailand.

The CuO NPs showed variable fungitoxic effects against A. flavus and A. niger. At higher doses (1 mg/mL), 83.51% of mycelial inhibition was found against A. flavus, but 43.51% was found against A. niger. The percentage inhibition of mycelial growth was found to be dose dependent. The cell viability analysis was carried out to reveal the mechanism of the fungitoxic effect of synthesized NPs and it was revealed that the CuO NPs caused oxidative stress associated with increased ROS production, leading to fungal cell death. The synthesized CuO NPs showed single phase cupric oxide with a monoclinic structure and highly uniform in size (3-5 nm). As the synthesized CuO NPs showed good stability under open atmospheric conditions and a fungitoxicity effect against A. flavus, they may be used to control fungal diseases in an eco-friendly manner.

J	Samahita, M; Devereux, K				Samahita, Margaret; Devereux, Kevin			Are Economics Conferences Gender-Neutral? Evidence from Ireland	OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS			English	Article; Early Access							BLIND; PROFESSION; DIVERSITY; WOMEN	We study gender inequality in conference acceptance using data from the Irish Economic Association annual conference from 2016 to 2022, exploiting the introduction of anonymized submission in 2021 to study the effect of blinding. While no gender gap is observed in organizers' acceptance decisions, there is an indication of gender difference favouring the in-group at the reviewer stage. In particular, male reviewers persistently give higher scores to papers with an increasing share of male authors. Evidence suggests that the difference stems from unconscious stereotyping against lesser known female authors. Anonymization eliminates the gender gap of male reviewers, but introduces a gender gap in favour of male authors for female reviewers. We explore differential selection as an alternative explanation, finding that reviewer experience postblinding could potentially account for our results.

In the initial stage of this study, it was observed from the data analysis and it was evident that women are particularly a soft target of many cybercriminals and cyber fraudsters. Women feel insecure in cyberspace, hence there is a need to dive deeper into our understanding and statistics of cybercrimes against women in India. It becomes necessary to determine the factors that have led to the clear surge of such crimes in recent years. In recent studies no such analysis is done focusing on geographical factors and top most cybercrime types committed against women. Therefore, in this article, prediction for cybercrime trends against women was performed using statistical tools and techniques to provide a better insight into the current scenario revolving around cybercrimes and women. A regressive statistical analysis of cybercrime data of all states of India to understand the current trend of cybercrimes, identification of the most vulnerable states of India and specific cybercrime with their percentage in whole, also where cybercrime afflicted women stand in those numbers. Further, for preventive measures a robust guidelines is proposed to combat cybercrimes for a better future.

J	Santori, P				Santori, Paolo			Augustinian Roots of Rawls&apos;s Second Principle of Justice: Grace and Fair Equality of Opportunity	MODERN THEOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							RAWLS	The debate over John Rawls's two principles of justice is ongoing. Among the many controversies, there is a hierarchal relationship within the second principle of justice. Scholars have long discussed the meaning and desirability of the lexical priority of the principle of fair equality of opportunity over the difference principle. The present article explores this topic from an unusual and underdeveloped angle. The controversy will be analyzed through the theological categories developed by the young Rawls in his work A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith. There, Rawls rejected the Pelagian heresy, according to which human beings can merit their salvation in a contractual relationship with God. Conversely, they can perform actions and deeds with implications for their eternal life by virtue of the gratuitous and undeserved intervention of God. I will show how this theological understanding became a political idea expressed precisely in the content and structure of the second principle of justice. As final remarks, I will argue that the appeal to the young Rawls's idea can be a suitable, yet unexpected, way in which the comprehensive doctrine of Christianity can support the political conception of justice expressed in Rawls's second major work, Political Liberalism.

Aims: This study aimed to investigate the influence of organic matter (OM), the content of pedogenic iron (Fe) (oxyhydr)oxides, and aggregate size on the stability of aggregates in arable soil. Methods: To this end, the Ap and Bt horizons of a Luvisol were sampled after 14 years of bare fallow, and the results were compared with a control field that had been permanently cropped. Results: In the Ap horizon, bare fallow decreased the median diameter of the 53-250 mu m size fraction by 26%. Simultaneously, the mass of the 20-53 mu m size fraction increased by 65%, indicating reduced stability-particularly of larger soil microaggregates-due to the lack of input of fresh OM. The range of (14)carbon (C-14) fraction of modern C ((FC)-C-14) under bare fallow was between 0.50 and 0.90, and thus lower than the cropped site ((FC)-C-14 between 0.75 and 1.01), which is particularly pronounced in the smallest size fraction, indicating the presence of older C. This higher stability and the reduced C turnover in <20 mu m aggregates is probably also due to having the highest content of poorly crystalline Fe (oxy)hydroxides, compared to the other size fractions, which act as a cementing agent. Colloid transport from the Ap to the Bt horizon was observed under bare fallow treatment. Conclusions: The lack of input of OM decreased the stability of microaggregates and led to a release of mobile colloids, the transport of which can initiate elemental fluxes with as-yet unknown environmental consequences.

To investigate the plasma membrane repair mechanism, a method for causing controllable plasma membrane injury on single cells and the visualization of the plasma membrane repair process are proposed. A microregion with harmful chemicals is created by open microfluidic probe, which is applied to target single cells for injury. The injury time is precisely controlled by simply moving the target cells in and out of the microregion. Wound-repair process caused by injury is analyzed by fluorescence imaging in real time, revealing the repair kinetics at the single cell level. Using this method, the effect of external conditions (Ca2+, Mg2+, glucose) on plasma membrane repair in single cells is studied and the dynamics of intracellular species (Ca2+) is monitored. Meanwhile, cellular heterogeneity of plasma membrane repair is revealed. This method provides a precise way to induce chemical plasma membrane injury at the single-cell level, which is a promising tool to study the mechanism of plasma membrane repair. A method for plasma membrane repair studies by using microfluidic probes is constructed. The repair process of single cells in different conditions is investigated by this method. This method can cause time-controlled chemical injury to single cells, which is a promising tool for studying plasma membrane repair mechanisms and self-repair capacity of single cells.image	[Song, Yang; Zhang, Qiang; Li, Yuxuan; Lin, Jiaxu; Lin, Jin-Ming] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Key Lab Microanalyt Methods & Instrumentat, Key Lab Bioorgan Phosphorus Chem & Chem Biol, Dept Chem,Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China	Tsinghua University	Zhang, Q; Lin, JM (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Key Lab Microanalyt Methods & Instrumentat, Key Lab Bioorgan Phosphorus Chem & Chem Biol, Dept Chem,Minist Educ, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.	zhangq2022@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn; jmlin@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn			National Key Research and Development Program of China [2022YFC3400700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [22034005, 81973569]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2022M721805]	National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)	This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2022YFC3400700), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 22034005 and 81973569) and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M721805).		48	0	0	2	2	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA	2365-709X			ADV MATER TECHNOL-US	Adv.

Seniha			Development of Procaine Loaded Transdermal Patches Based on Biopolymer Pectin, Castor Oil, and Polyethylene Glycol for Controllable Drug Release Studies and Their Characterizations	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Biopolymer; castor oil; drug delivery; pectin; transdermal patch	HYDROGEN-BONDING INTERACTION; SKIN-PENETRATION ENHANCERS; POLY(ETHYLENE GLYCOL); METHOXYL PECTIN; DELIVERY; ALCOHOL; PERMEATION; FTIR	Transdermal drug delivery systems have considerable attention in clinical and point-of-care applications due to their superior advantages such as non-invasive properties and keeping drug efficiency. To overcome the skin barrier, penetration enhancers are employed in the patch design. Chemical penetration enhancers are the most frequently applied way to improve drug diffusion through the barrier. Transdermal patches are designed as a drug-loaded thin-film hydrogel. Since the patch material must be biocompatible and eco-friendly, in this study, pectin-based transdermal patches are designed, and procaine, a painkiller drug is chosen as a model drug. Benzyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and castor oil are selected as chemical penetration enhancers. Drug diffusion experiments are carried out by using Franz diffusion cells at 37 & DEG;C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are used to characterize the chemical structure and thermal properties of the patches. The patches are evaluated by the contact angle measurement and the swelling test in terms of their hydrophilicity and water uptake. Regarding in vitro drug release experiments by Franz diffusion cells, drug-loaded patches were examined (CxPy-PC; C-castor oil, P-PEG, x-y amounts (mg)). It is found that the most promising results come from C10-P5-PC (12.7 mg drug/g film) and C30-P5-PC (11.4 mg drug/ g film) which can be attributed to the synergetic and optimum amount of polyethylene glycol and castor oil. Transdermal drug delivery is a new-generation drug delivery method. In this study, drug molecules are released through a biocompatible hydrogel patch with the help of pectin-based hydrogel structure, chemical penetration enhancers castor oil (CO), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The hydrophilic structure of PEG and pectin hydrogel and the hydrogel's porosity structure are crucial elements for transdermal drug delivery. Franz diffusion cell experiments are carried out at 37 & DEG;C to examine drug delivery through a synthetic membrane which is aimed to mimic the skin. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are used to characterize the patches & PRIME; chemical structure and thermal properties. The patches are evaluated by the contact angle measurement and the swelling test. Results from the Franz diffusion cells show that the most promising results come from C10-P5-PC (12.7 mg drug/g film) and C30-P5-PC (11.4 mg drug/g film) which can be attributed to the synergetic and optimum amount of PEG and CO.image	[Tavasli, Aybuke] Istanbul Tech Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, TR-34469 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Kocaaga, Banu; Guner, F.

The Intersection Between Meritocracy and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion	OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY			English	Editorial Material; Early Access						diversity; equity; inclusion; meritocracy		Embracing meritocracy and diversity, equity, and inclusion is critical to the future of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Understanding the intersection of these two concepts is particularly important. Meritocracy, a key principle utilized in academic medicine and surgery, rewards individual achievement. However, it can inadvertently result in a widening disparity between individuals who have access to environments promoting and facilitating meritocracy and those facing systemic structural barriers. Navigating the intersection of meritocracy and diversity, equity, and inclusion is a complex endeavor. However, it is crucial to understand that these concepts can coexist. With a balanced approach, we can appreciate individual merit while fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. It requires a commitment to systemic change, ongoing evaluation, and collaboration to create environments where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and contribute unique talents and perspectives. Through these efforts, our specialty of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery will be stronger.

In this study, we explored the functions of Class II KNOTTED-like homeobox (KNOXII) genes in the model leguminous plant Medicago truncatula. Phenotypic and genetic analyses suggest that MtKNOX4, 5 are able to repress leaflet formation, while MtKNOX3, 9, 10 are not involved in this developmental process. Further investigations have shown that MtKNOX4 represses the CK signal transduction, which is downstream of MtKNOXI-mediated CK biosynthesis. Additionally, two boundary genes, FUSED COMPOUND LEAF1 (orthologue of Arabidopsis Class M KNOX) and NO APICAL MERISTEM (orthologue of Arabidopsis CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON), are necessary for MtKNOX4-mediated compound leaf formation. These findings suggest, that among the members of MtKNOXII, MtKNOX4 plays a crucial role in integrating the CK pathway and boundary regulators, providing new insights into the roles of MtKNOXII in regulating the elaboration of compound leaves in M. truncatula.

Therefore, detecting the relation between EMF and biodiversity under human intervention would provide guidance on the optimization of sustainable grassland management. However, little is known about how grazing effects grassland EMF by mediating biodiversity under different grazing intensities. Here, species and functional diversity were investigated along a longitudinal gradient in Inner Mongolia grassland, and its EMF was quantified comprehensively on six ecosystem functions by an averaging approach, threshold approach and multiple threshold approach to assess the impact of grazing intensity on EMF. There was a significantly lower average EMF index and above-ground biomass under heavy grazing (HG) than under light grazing (LG). The threshold approach-based EMF and average EMF index were positively related to species diversity and functional diversity, and species diversity was a stronger driver of EMF than functional diversity. Compared with LG, the slope of the positive relation between EMF and species diversity significantly weakened by 40%-86% under moderate grazing (MG) and decreased by 30%-100% under HG, and reversed to a negative relation between functional diversity and EMF under HG. Additionally, species diversity was more negatively influenced by soil pH and sand content, while functional diversity was more negatively influenced by grazing intensity, indicating that functional diversity was more sensitive to intensive grazing. This study highlights the role of grazing intensity for driving multiple ecosystem functions, and reinforces the significance of managing both species diversity and functional diversity for sustaining productive functional grasslands.

However, with advances in materials chemistry and characterization tools, new emerging areas are arising with a focus on "smart droplets". The versatility of emulsion droplets across is based on their ability to partition and create isolated systems with properties defined by the liquid-liquid interface, while preparative routes allow manipulation of droplet size, stability, and encapsulated contents. As described in this article, significant efforts are being devoted to creating new types of droplets by "activating" this interface through the incorporation of reactive structures that trigger droplet response to applied or environmental stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, salt, or external fields). Moreover, parallels between droplets and live cells inspire efforts to conceive systems that resemble biological motifs or that can produce cellular behaviors that imitate biology (e.g., swarming, communication, or motion). The authors highlight recent advances in smart droplets, with emphasis on organic, polymer, and/or particle surfactants that give rise to inter-droplet communication (via aggregation, fusion, division, or mass transfer), droplet vehicles for controlled delivery, autonomous droplet motion, and tunable emulsion inversion. Especially emphasized is the macromolecular design to produce reactive and functional surfactants, which are crucial to responsive droplet behavior and their underlying mechanisms. More generally, the exquisite interplay between materials science and biology inspires the review of this research area that provides unique opportunities for insight and inspiration into the capabilities of new droplet designs. The ability to stabilize droplets with reactive, functional surfactants opens a wealth of opportunities to create "smart" fluidic structures that exhibit autonomous or responsive properties. This review highlights the impact of advances at the interface of surfactant design and droplet science, including inter-droplet communication (i.e., aggregation, fusion, division, etc.), droplet vehicles for controlled delivery, autonomous motion, and tunable inversion.image	[Yang, Zhefei; Snyder, Deborah; Sathyan, Ashlin; Emrick, Todd] Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Balazs, Anna] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA	University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh	Emrick, T (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Conte Ctr Polymer Res, Polymer Sci & Engn Dept, 120 Governors Dr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.	tsemrick@mail.pse.umass.edu			The authors appreciate the support of their work on biomolecular materials and smart, responsive interfaces from the Department of Energy Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Science and Engineering (DE-SC0008876).

However, achieving high power conversion efficiencies in real-world applications remains a significant challenge for power supply textiles. Here a unique hybrid counter electrode made from metal current collector fiber with high electrical conductivity, aligned carbon nanotube sheet with high electrocatalytic property, and porous titanium dioxide/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) film with high light reflectance is designed. For the resulting fiber dye-sensitized solar cell, a rapid charge collection and transport are achieved, and the unique advantage of absorbing light from all directions is effectively realized, producing a record power conversion efficiency of 12.52%. The power conversion efficiency varies below 10% after bending, twisting, or pressing for 1000 cycles. These fiber dye-sensitized solar cells are further integrated with fiber batteries as power systems for a smart bracelet, demonstrating the effective power solution for wearables. With the design of hybrid counter electrode composed of reflective layer to absorb light from 360 & DEG; directions for more light harvesting, the resulting fiber dye-sensitized solar cell produces a record power conversion efficiency of 12.52%.

This study aimed to apply a combined serological-molecular testing protocol under field conditions for diagnosing BGL in cows with gestational losses. Methods: Three beef herds with reproductive failures were studied, and 60 cows with gestational losses (20 from each herd) were randomly selected for laboratory diagnosis of BGL. In addition, 40 cows with normal pregnancy were included as a control. Blood samples were collected from all 100 cows formicroscopic agglutination testing, and cervicovaginalmucus (CVM) samples were collected from 28 cows with gestational losses and 20 control cows for lipL32-PCR. Results: All herds had high Leptospira seroreactivity (>65%), mainly against serogroup Sejroe. Ten of the 28 CVM samples from cows with gestational losses were PCR-positive, while all samples from the control group were negative (p < 0.05). Limitations: Unfortunately, the positive samples did not amplify in secY-PCR for nucleotide sequencing, whichwould allowthe identification of leptospiral strains. Conclusion: Serology was sufficient to indicate leptospirosis at the herd level, but the definitive diagnosis of BGL was only possible using CVM PCR. Although seroreactivity against serogroup Sejroe has been associated with gestational losses, this is the first study to conductCVMPCR as a confirmatory test for BGL diagnosis in extensive beef herds under field conditions.

The most common in industry is the gamma sterilization; however, the radiation used in this method can induce modifications in the material properties. This study investigates the impact of such radiations on the physicochemical properties and biological toxicity of a new biomaterial based on a poly-l-co-d,l-lactide polymer honeycomb membrane and bioactive glass (BG), combined, to form an assembly (membrane/BG assembly). The investigated BGs are the S53P4, which is FDA approved and clinically used, and 13-93B20, a BG containing boron promising for bone regeneration. Infrared and photoluminescence measurements revealed that, upon irradiation, defects are created in the BGs molecular matrix. Defects were identified to be mainly non-bridging oxygen hole center and occur in higher proportion in the 13-93B20 making it more sensitive to irradiation compared to the S53P4. However, the irradiation does not significantly impact the structure of the BGs. On the membrane side, the molecular weight is divided by two resulting in a lower shear stress resistance. However, the membrane honeycomb topography does not seem to be impacted by the irradiation. In contact with cells, no toxicity effect was observed, and BGs keep their bioactive properties by releasing ions beneficial to the cell fate and with no influence on apatite precipitation speed. Overall, this study showed that, despite some impact on the physicochemical properties, the irradiation does not induce deleterious effect on the membrane/BG assemblies and is therefore a suitable method for the sterilization of this novel biomaterial. Non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) and oxygen-deficient centers (ODC) appear in the membrane/BaG assemblies after irradiation. The honeycomb membrane keeps its structure but the polymer undergoes chain scission. Overall, the properties' modifications of the membrane/BaG assemblies do not have a toxicity effect on the cells. image	[Coquen, Audrey Deraine; Pauthe, Emmanuel; Boissiere, Michel] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Equipe Rech Relat Matrice Extracellulaire Cellules, ERRMECe, Maison Internatl Rech MIR, Rue Descartes, Neuville Sur Oise, France; [Coquen, Audrey Deraine; Petit, Laeticia; Kellomaki, Minna; Massera, Jonathan] Tampere Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Technol, Lab Biomat & Tissue Engn, Tampere, Finland; [Bondzior, Bartosz] Tampere Univ, Photon Lab, Tampere, Finland; [Bondzior, Bartosz] Inst Low Temp & Struct Res PAS, Wroclaw, Poland; [Coquen, Audrey Deraine; Massera, Jonathan] Tampere Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Technol, Bioceram Bioglasses & Biocomposites Grp, Korkeakoulunkatu 3, Tampere SM424, Tampere 33720, Finland	CY Cergy Paris Universite; Tampere University; Tampere University; Polish Academy of Sciences; Institute of Low Temperature & Structure Research; Tampere University	Coquen, AD; Massera, J (corresponding author), Tampere Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Technol, Bioceram Bioglasses & Biocomposites Grp, Korkeakoulunkatu 3, Tampere SM424, Tampere 33720, Finland.	audrey.deraine@tuni.fi; jonathan.massera@tuni.fi			The authors would like to acknowledge the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation and the ReTis Chair for financial support, the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAE) for enabling researcher mobility, and the i-Mat platform for technical support.

In patient-specific clinical contexts, transparent recommendations that allow for contraindications and other conflicts arising from co-morbidity are a requirement. In this work, we develop and evaluate a non-proprietary, standards-based approach to the deployment of computable guidelines with explainable argumentation, integrated with a commercial electronic health record (EHR) system in Serbia, a middle-income country in West Balkans.Methods: We used an ontological framework, the Transition-based Medical Recommendation (TMR) model, to represent, and reason about, guideline concepts, and chose the 2017 International global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) guideline and a Serbian hospital as the deployment and evaluation site, respectively. To mitigate potential guideline conflicts, we used a TMR-based implementation of the Assumptions-Based Argumentation framework extended with preferences and Goals (ABA+G). Remote EHR integration of computable guidelines was via a microservice architecture based on HL7 FHIR and CDS Hooks. A prototype integration was developed to manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with comorbid cardiovascular or chronic kidney diseases, and a mixed-methods evaluation was conducted with 20 simulated cases and five pulmonologists.Results: Pulmonologists agreed 97% of the time with the GOLD-based COPD symptom severity assessment assigned to each patient by the CDSS, and 98% of the time with one of the proposed COPD care plans. Comments were favourable on the principles of explainable argumentation; inclusion of additional co-morbidities was suggested in the future along with customisation of the level of explanation with expertise.Conclusion: An ontological model provided a flexible means of providing argumentation and explainable artificial intelligence for a long-term condition. Extension to other guidelines and multiple co-morbidities is needed to test the approach further.

The leaky-wave radiation from a high-permittivity dielectric waveguide is utilised here to support the operation of the proposed antenna. A non-closed dielectric loop covering a three-quarter circle is adopted to generate CP radiation and it is connected with the dielectric ground via one of bending ends to form an all-in-one structure of the antenna. The other end is also bent and vertical to the ground, but hanging in the air for probe feed. As two kinds of typical high-permittivity dielectric materials, zirconia ceramic and pure water are used to implement the proposed design respectively. On one hand, an all-ceramic CP loop antenna made of zirconia is proposed. And benefiting from the low loss and high melting point of zirconia, the proposed ceramic antenna has superiority in radiation efficiency and could adapt to a harsh environment. On the other hand, by using pure water and transparent container, a fully-transparent CP water loop antenna can be obtained. Finally, a 3-D printing technology is adopted in the manufacturing of ceramic structure and resin container. Measured results of both antennas demonstrate the validity of the proposed design. A class of all-dielectric CP loop antenna made of high-permittivity ceramic/water is proposed to take full advantages of dielectric characteristics. 3-D printing technology is here utilised to form the all-in-one structure of the proposed antenna. This work provides a methodology for the implementation of all-dielectric CP antennas with all-in-one structures.image	[Fan, Fei; Zheng, Wen; Zhang, Feng; Guo, Zai-Cheng; Wang, Shiyan] Nanjing Normal Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab 3D Printing Equipment & Mfg, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Hua, Changzhou] Ningbo Univ, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ningbo, Peoples R China; [Li, Yin] Peng Cheng Lab, Dept Broadband Commun, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China	Nanjing Normal University; Ningbo University; Peng Cheng Laboratory	Wang, SY (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab 3D Printing Equipment & Mfg, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Hua, CZ (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ningbo, Peoples R China.	huachangzhou@126.com; nustwang@163.com			National Natural Science Foundation of China [62101271, 62271273]; Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo [2022J097]; Postgraduate Research Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province [SJCX22_0555]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20200726, BK20210557]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo; Postgraduate Research Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province)	National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 62101271, 62271273; Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, Grant/ Award Number: 2022J097; Postgraduate Research Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province, Grant/ Award Number: SJCX22_0555; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, Grant/Award Numbers: BK20200726, BK20210557		34	0	0	3	3	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1751-8725	1751-8733		IET MICROW ANTENNA P	IET Microw.

Juvenile systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an orphan disease, associated with high morbidity and mortality. New treatment strategies are much needed, but clearly defining appropriate outcomes is necessary if successful therapies are to be developed. Our objective here was to propose such outcomes.Methods. This proposal is the result of 4 face-to-face consensus meetings with a 27-member multidisciplinary team of pediatric rheumatologists, adult rheumatologists, dermatologists, pediatric cardiologists, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, a statistician, and patients. Throughout the process, we reviewed the existing adult data in this field, the more limited pediatric literature for juvenile SSc outcomes, and data from 2 juvenile SSc patient cohorts to assist in making informed, data-driven decisions. The use of items for each domain as an outcome measure in an open label 12-month clinical trial of juvenile SSc was voted and agreed upon using a nominal group technique.Results. After voting, the domains agreed on were global disease activity, skin, Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, musculoskeletal, cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and gastrointestinal involvement, and quality of life. Fourteen outcome measures had 100% agreement, 1 item had 91% agreement, and 1 item had 86% agreement. The domains of biomarkers and growth/development were moved to the research agenda.Conclusion. We reached consensus on multiple domains and items that should be assessed in an open label, 12-month clinical juvenile SSc trial as well as a research agenda for future development.

Other endpoints measured persistence with treatment, clinical outcomes (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and weight) and treatment patterns. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first significant treatment change and persistence with treatment were generated. Propensity-score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for baseline imbalances in the comparison between cohorts.Results: The 286 of 1014 patients (28.2%) in the dulaglutide cohort and 448 of 991 patients (45.2%) in the liraglutide cohort had a significant treatment change over 24 months. By IPTW analysis, dulaglutide-initiating patients were less likely to have a significant treatment change (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.63) and more likely to be persistent with treatment (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.86) over 24 months than liraglutide-initiating patients. Dulaglutide and liraglutide yielded similar HbA1c (-11.80 mmol/mol [1.08%] and -11.91 mmol/mol [1.09%]) and weight (-3.5 kg and -3.3 kg) reductions from baseline to 24 months. Few changes in patterns of treatment with other GLMs were observed in the two cohorts.Conclusions: Dulaglutide-initiating patients had a longer time spent without any significant treatment change and higher persistence than those initiating liraglutide. Treatment with either glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist yielded similar and clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and body weight.

Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies in the Midwest from 2016 to 2019, the results show that the greater the importance of officials' poverty alleviation assessment, the higher the participation of firms in precise poverty alleviation. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) contribute more to the reduction of destitution than private enterprises. We further find that local SOEs' participation in precision poverty alleviation enhances the likelihood of executive promotion, while private enterprises' participation in precision poverty alleviation increases government subsidies and reduces the cost of debt financing. These findings imply that the evaluation mechanisms of Chinese officials can effectively promote enterprises fulfilling social responsibilities.

This study evaluated the effect of Furcraea foetida fiber content on the tribological behavior of composites. A water-retting method was employed to extract the fibers, and resin transfer molding was used to fabricate the composites. The frictional force, coefficient of friction (COF), and wear rate were measured under dry test conditions and various applied loads (80, 100, 120, and 140 N). Microstructural analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy to investigate the surface morphology and wear mechanisms of the composites. The results revealed that the composite with 50 vol% of fibers exhibits the lowest frictional force and COF in both normal and parallel orientations with overall average COF of 0.43 in normal orientation and 0.42 in parallel orientation. Moreover, the composite with 60 vol% demonstrates the best wear resistance with an overall average specific wear rate of 2.1982 x (10(-5)) mm(3)/Nm in normal orientation and 4.3478 x (10(-5)) mm(3)/Nm in parallel orientation. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the tribological behavior of Furcraea foetida fiber-reinforced epoxy composites and identifies the optimal volume fractions for improved friction and wear performance.

Here, we have focused on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as an effective therapeutic target in CRC and studied the effects of polyphenols known to modulate several key signalling mechanisms including EGFR signalling, associated with anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic properties.Experimental ApproachUsing ligand- and structure-based cheminformatics, we developed three potent, selective alkylaminophenols, 2-[(3,4-dihydroquinolin-1(2H)-yl)(p-tolyl)methyl]phenol (THTMP), 2-[(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-1-yl)(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl]phenol (THMPP) and N-[2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl(4 & PRIME;-methylphenyl)methyl]indoline (HNPMI). These alkylaminophenols were assessed for EGFR interaction, EGFR-pathway modulation, cytotoxic and apoptosis induction, caspase activation and transcriptional and translational regulation. The lead compound HNPMI was evaluated in mice bearing xenografts of CRC cells.Key ResultsOf the three alkylaminophenols tested, HNPMI exhibited the lowest IC50 in CRC cells and potential cytotoxic effects on other tumour cells. Modulation of EGFR pathway down-regulated protein levels of osteopontin, survivin and cathepsin S, leading to apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that HNPMI induced G0/G1 phase arrest in CRC cells. HNPMI altered the mRNA for and protein levels of several apoptosis-related proteins including caspase 3, BCL-2 and p53. HNPMI down-regulated the proteins crucial to oncogenesis in CRC cells. Assays in mice bearing CRC xenografts showed that HNPMI reduced the relative tumour volume.Conclusions and ImplicationsHNPMI is a promising EGFR inhibitor for clinical translation. HNPMI regulated apoptosis and oncogenesis by modulating BCL-2/BAX and p53 in CRC cell lines, showing potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of CRC.

No known studies have normalized quantitative measures of DD severity relative to multiple variables such as age, height, and disc level. This study developed normalized quantitative measures (z-scores) of disc signal intensity (DSI) and disc height (DH) to rate relative severity of DD. Methods: Raw (unnormalized) quantitative measures of DSI and DH alongside potential normalization variables were acquired from MRI scans and clinical data of 76 patients. The associations between the raw quantitative measures and potential normalization variables were investigated to develop the normalized quantitative measures (z-scores) of DSI and DH. Construct validity was assessed by comparing the normalized measures to an experienced radiologist's subjective measures of relative severity of DSI and DH loss. Results: CSF signal intensity, age, and disc level were significantly associated with raw DSI (R-2 = 0.06, 0.25, and 0.09, respectively). Lumbar height and disc level were significantly associated with raw DH (R-2 = 0.13 and 0.31). Normalizing DSI and DH by these variables resulted in stronger relationships (R-2 = 0.39 and 0.37) than raw DSI and DH (R-2 = 0.24 and 0.31) with the radiologist's subjective measures. Normalized DSI and DH were both normally distributed (p = 0.32 and 0.12). Conclusions: Construct validity and the distributions suggested that normalized quantitative measures of DSI and DH are better than existing measures of DSI and DH at rating relative DD severity. Determining whether normalized quantitative measures are more predictive of clinical outcomes is important future research.

However, the inter-relationships between the two domains over development and emerging autistic traits are not fully established. We studied language and motor development using standardized observational and parent-report measures in infants with (n = 271) and without (n = 137) a family history of autism across four waves of data collection from 10 to 36 months. We used Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models to examine contemporaneous and longitudinal associations between language and motor developments in both elevated and typical likelihood groups. We estimated paths between language and motor abilities at 10, 14, 24, and 36 months and autism trait scores at 36 months, to test whether the domains were interrelated and how they related to emerging autism traits. Results revealed consistent bidirectional Expressive Language (EL) and Fine Motor (FM) cross-lagged effects from 10 to 24 and a unidirectional EL to FM effect from 24 to 36 months as well as significantly correlated random intercepts between Gross motor (GM) and Receptive language (RL), indicating stable concurrent associations over time. However, only the associations between GM and RL were associated with later autism traits. Early motor and language are linked, but only gross motor and receptive language are jointly associated with autistic traits in infants with an autism family history.

The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three-electron transfer lithium-halogen battery based on I-/I+ and Cl-/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl- anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85 V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631 mAh g-1I (265 mAh g-1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record-high energy density of up to 2013 Wh kg-1I (845 Wh kg-1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high-energy-density pursuit. The static organic lithium-iodine (chlorine) batteries fueled by brand-new three-electron redox chemistry (redox couples: I-/I+ and Cl-/Cl0) with electrochemically active tetrabutylammonium triiodide cathode exhibit the excellent specific energy density, representing a significant advancement in the field of halogen battery.+image	[Li, Xinliang] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Phys & Microelect, Key Lab Mat Phys, Minist Educ, Zhengzhou 450052, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinliang; Li, Shimei; Li, Pei; Huang, Zhaodong; Liang, Guojin; Zhi, Chunyi] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanlei; Lu, Junfeng; He, Hongyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Li, Shimei; Huang, Zhaodong; Zhi, Chunyi] Hong Kong Ctr Cerebro Cardiovasc Hlth Engn COCHE, Shatin, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China	Zhengzhou University; City University of Hong Kong; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Process Engineering, CAS	Zhi, CY (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Kowloon, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.; He, HY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.; Zhi, CY (corresponding author), Hong Kong Ctr Cerebro Cardiovasc Hlth Engn COCHE, Shatin, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.	hyhe@ipe.ac.cn; cy.zhi@cityu.edu.hk	He, Hongyan/V-5942-2017	He, Hongyan/0000-0003-1291-2771; ZHI, Chunyi/0000-0001-6766-5953	National Key R&D Program of China [2019YFA0705104]; Overseas Excellent Young Scholars of the National, Natural Science Foundation of China; GRF [CityU 11304921]	National Key R&D Program of China; Overseas Excellent Young Scholars of the National, Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); GRF	This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Project 2019YFA0705104, Overseas Excellent Young Scholars of the National, Natural Science Foundation of China, and GRF under Project CityU 11304921.		54	0	0	24	24	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1433-7851	1521-3773		ANGEW CHEM INT EDIT	Angew.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway is an essential pathway involved in regulating various physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and more. This pathway also contributes to several important physiological processes in silkworms, including protein synthesis, reproduction, and immune defense against pathogens. Organizing related studies on the ERK signaling pathway in silkworms can provide a better understanding of its mechanism in Lepidopterans and develop a theoretical foundation for improving cocoon production and new strategies for pest biological control.

Univariate and multivariate models evaluated the direct and indirect impact of ST on CD severity and treatment, while controlling for confounds.ResultsComplete ST was associated with a 10% lower mean onabotA dose. Absence of complete ST was associated with a higher onabotA dose after controlling for dystonia severity (OR = 1.37, P = 0.04). ST moderated the relationship between dystonia severity and toxin dose (& beta; = -0.16, P = 0.02).ConclusionsST is related to lower CD severity and toxin dose. It may have a direct effect on lowering toxin dose, independent of CD severity.

Alternatively, the "shift current mechanism" has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation-less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism. So far, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has been discussed based on the classical explanation that photocurrent originates from macroscopic polarization. Herein, we report the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs. The light polarization dependence is consistent with the shift current mechanism, which possesses effective features, such as ultrafast response and dissipation-less nature.image	[Noma, Taishi; Chen, Hsiao-Yi; Dhara, Barun; Arita, Ryotaro] RIKEN, Ctr Emergent Matter Sci CEMS, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Sotome, Masato] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Mat Engn, 7-3-1 Hongo,Bunkyo ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Sotome, Masato; Nomoto, Takuya; Arita, Ryotaro] Univ Tokyo, Res Ctr Adv Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba,Meguro ku, Tokyo 1538904, Japan; [Miyajima, Daigo] Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan; [Miyajima, Daigo] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Miyajima, Daigo] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, 2001 Longxiang Blvd, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China	RIKEN; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; University of Tokyo; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen	Noma, T (corresponding author), RIKEN, Ctr Emergent Matter Sci CEMS, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.; Miyajima, D (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Solid State Phys, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778581, Japan.; Miyajima, D (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan.; Miyajima, D (corresponding author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, 2001 Longxiang Blvd, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China.	taishi.noma@riken.jp; dmiyajima@cuhk.edu.cn	Nakamura, Masao/IXE-0113-2023; Arita, Ryotaro/D-5965-2012; Miyajima, Daigo/B-5623-2013	Nakamura, Masao/0000-0002-6812-6334; Arita, Ryotaro/0000-0001-5725-072X; Miyajima, Daigo/0000-0002-9578-7349; Dhara, Barun/0000-0003-1648-8824; Nomoto, Takuya/0000-0002-4333-6773; Noma, Taishi/0009-0007-7260-6449; Sotome, Masato/0000-0003-1929-8161	JSPS KAKENHI [JP21K14531, JP23H04863, JP20K15198, JP21H04679, JP22H01969]; Mitsubishi Foundation [202011014]; Incentive Research Projects in RIKEN; JST, PRESTO (Japan) [JP1159382]; RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researchers Program	JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Mitsubishi Foundation; Incentive Research Projects in RIKEN; JST, PRESTO (Japan); RIKEN Special Postdoctoral Researchers Program	We thank Dr. F.

Therefore, we conducted a HLA association study to identify HLA alleles or haplotypes predisposing or protective against Japanese AHUO. The HLA 5 locus (HLA-A, HLA-B, C, DRB1, and DQB1) 4-digit genotyping results of 72 AHUO patients who underwent liver transplantation at our institution between 2000 and 2021 were compared to those of 873 healthy Japanese controls. Protective associations of HLA-B*52:01 (p-corrected (pc) = 3.15 x 10(-3)), HLA-C*12:02 (pc = 1.66 x10(-3)), HLA-DQB1*06:01 (pc = 1.42 x 10(-2)), and HLA-DRB1*15:02 (pc = 1.36 x 10(-2)) with severe AHUO in Japanese patients were observed. The amino acid residues of tryptophan at position 156, which are located in the antigen-binding grooves of the HLA-C protein, showed a protective association with AHUO, showing a significant difference from other amino acid variations (pc = 9.0 x 10(-4)). Furthermore, 5 amino acid residues of the HLA-DQB1 protein were also protectively associated with AHUO with a significant difference from other amino acid variations (pc = 1.42 x 10(-2) to 2.89 x 10(-2)). These alleles have a protective association with the aggravation of AHUO in the Japanese population.

Our findings confirm that public health spending has a positive effect on health capital formation. Dissecting social expenditure according to other nine social spending categories reveals a positive influence for old age pensions and unemployment benefits. The results for the remaining social programs vary with the health capital proxy and estimation method used. It thus appears that more comprehensive and universal social programs, possibly by guaranteeing the necessary income, do a better job in improving health human capital.

This study empirically examines the association between the foreign-background characteristics of executives and firm GI risk using data from 2008 to 2020 for A-share listed firms in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. The results show that there is a positive relationship between the foreign background of executives and the risk of GI of firms. Further results show that executives with foreign working backgrounds have a more significant positive impact on GI risk than executives with foreign study backgrounds. In addition, the positive effect of the foreign background of executives of non-state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on GI risk is more profound than that of SOEs. However, internal controls and institutional investors' shareholdings weaken the positive association between executives' foreign backgrounds and GI risk. This study provides evidence of the determinants of GI in firms and the economic consequences of the foreign-background characteristics of executives.

J	Watt, L				Watt, Lucas			Relational resource geographies of beche-de-mer under moratorium	ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT			English	Article; Early Access						beche-de-mer; Fiji; moratoria; Pacific; relational approach; sea cucumber	FISHERIES; PERSPECTIVES; TRADE	Moratorium is a common marine resource management strategy used by nation-states that abruptly reclassifies the harvesting and trade of designated resources as 'illegal' for a defined period. Nation-states use moratoria to help ecological stocks of overharvested marine species to recover. The Fijian state instituted a moratorium on the harvest and trade of beche-de-mer between 2017 and 2022 due to evidence of overfishing. Through ethnographic fieldwork with Fijian beche-de-mer fishers, traders and exporters, I examine how the moratorium affected relational trade flows of beche-de-mer. In precolonial Fiji, marine resources flowed through historically established regional socio-cultural pathways. During the colonial period, Chinese migrants in Fiji occupied a unique relational positionality to indigenous (itaukei) communities, which allowed them bridge domestic and international resource markets. Through my ethnographic fieldwork, I detail how beche-de-mer continued to be traded during and post moratorium within such a relational resource geography. I argue that the relational ties between itaukei communities and Chinese-Fijian buyers that subsequently connect to international markets undermined the moratorium restrictions, as well as the new conditionalities of trade after the moratorium was lifted. Such relationality in the marine resource trade renders moratoria an ineffective marine resource management strategy as it is inattentive to Pacific context.

In this study, the aim was to investigate the function and potential mechanism of Fto in dentine formation. Methodology: In vivo model, postnatal 12-day (PN12), 4-week- old (4 wk), 6-week- old (6 wk) healthy male C57BL/6J were randomly divided into Fto knockout (Fto(-/-)) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates according to their genotypes, with 3-5 mice in each group. The mandibles of Fto(-/-) mice and WT control littermates were isolated for analysis by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), 3-dimensional reconstruction and Haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. In vitro, mouse dental papilla cells (mDPCs) and human dental stem pulp cells (hDPSCs) were cultured with odontogenetic medium to evaluate differentiation capacity; expression levels of odontoblastic related genes were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The inclusion levels of Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) exon 5 in mDPCs and hDPSCs were detected by semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The RNA binding motif protein 4 (RBM4) m6A site was verified through m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and the stability of RBM4 mRNA influenced by FTO knockdown was measured by mRNA stability assay. Differences with p values <.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Results: We discovered that Fto(-/-) mice showed significant dentine formation defects characterized by widened pulp cavity, enlarged pulp-tooth volume ratio, thinned dentine and pre-dentine layer of root (p <.05). Fto(-/-) mDPCs and FTO-silencing hDPSCs not only exhibited insufficient mineralization ability and decreased expression levels of odontoblastic mineralization related genes (p <.05), but showed significantly reduced Runx2 exon 5 inclusion level (p <.05). FTO knockdown increased the m6A level of RBM4 and destabilized the mRNA of RBM4, thus contributing to the reduced RBM4 expression level. Moreover, Rbm4 overexpression in Fto(-/-) mDPCs can partly restore Runx2 exon 5 inclusion level and the differentiation ability disrupted by Fto knockout.

The quality of mushroom crisps varies with storage time of fresh L. edodes. Therefore, the effect of postharvest storage time (ranging from 0 to 14 days) of fresh L. edodes on quality characteristics of EPD- processed mushroom crisps was evaluated. RESULTS: The weight loss and total color difference of fresh L. edodes were increased to 2.95% and 24.66, but moisture content, firmness and lightness were reduced by 6.14%, 40.70% and 43.57%, respectively, after 14 days storage. The puffing degree of mushroom crisps was initially increased to its highest value (55.95%) on the 4th day storage and thereafter decreased. The highest rehydration ratio (2.36) and crispness (63.67), and lowest hardness (102.95 N) of mushroom crisps were fabricated with L. edodes on the 4th day of storage. Free water was predominant in fresh L. edodes, which was decreased for fresh L. edodes, whereas it increased initially to the maximum value and decreased thereafter for osmotic dehydrated and heat pump pre-dried L. edodes with increasing storage time. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed that fresh L. edodes stored at different times had a remarkable effect on quality characteristics of mushroom crisps. CONCLUSION: Fresh L. edodes stored at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 4 days is recommended for fabrication of mushroom crisps with superior quality. This study provides a theoretical basis for selection of a suitable storage time for fresh L. edodes before EPD of crisps. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

This scoping review aimed to identify, explore and map the available literature on the STR criteria triggering the investigation of STR.Materials and MethodsFour electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Science Direct, Embase) were searched to retrieve scientific literature reporting such criteria, published from 1 January 2000 to 5 May 2022. Grey literature was also searched from open web sources.ResultsOf 1052 references identified, 43 (21 peer-reviewed and 22 grey literature) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion and data extraction after full article screening. Of them, most (27/43, 62.79%) were found to report a single set of criteria, and only two reported four or more sets of criteria. The analysis of 66 sets of criteria collected from the selected references revealed 57 different sets. A few sets of criteria used only one sign and symptom (s/s) (12.12%, n = 8), whereas 16 sets used 7-15 s/s (n = 16/66; 24.24%). Of the total 319 occurrences of s/s associated with the 66 sets of criteria, post-transfusion hyperthermia, body temperature increase and hypotension were the most common s/s categories. Of all the literature available, only one study tested the diagnostic accuracy of the STR criteria.ConclusionThis scoping review revealed a substantial variation in criteria used to identify suspected STR. Consequently, conducting further studies to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of these criteria, which trigger STR investigations, is imperative for advancing clinical practice.

Comparing safety and efficacy of acoustic subcision at two different rapid acoustic pulse rates to improve the appearance of cellulite	LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						100 Hz pulse rate; acoustic subcision; cellulite; noninvasive; rapid acoustic pulse		BackgroundA recent study showed the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive acoustic subcision device to improve the appearance of cellulite via delivery of rapid acoustic pulses in a single treatment visit.ObjectiveTo evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of a single rapid acoustic pulse treatment visit using an equivalent number of rapid acoustic pulses at a pulse rate of 100 or 50 Hz.MethodsThis single-center, prospective study enrolled 15 adult women with moderate to severe cellulite according to the Cellulite Dimple-At Rest Scale. Each participant would receive nominally 72,000 rapid acoustic pulses at a pulse rate of 50 Hz on the left buttock and thigh, and nominally 72,000 rapid acoustic pulses at a pulse rate of 100 Hz on the right buttock and thigh within one treatment visit. Efficacy was assessed by the ability of blinded, independent reviewers to correctly distinguish the pre- and post-treatment photos, participant satisfaction, and the change in Cellulite Dimple-At Rest scores for each treatment side. Safety was monitored throughout the conduct of the study.ResultsFor both 100 and 50 Hz pulse rate treated areas, the majority (two out of three) of blinded reviewers correctly identified 100% of the pre/post-treatment photos. For both the 100 and 50 Hz treated areas, 80% of participants agreed/strongly agreed that their cellulite appeared improved at the 12-week follow-up visit. Significant improvements in Cellulite Dimple-At Rest scores were seen for both the 100 and 50 Hz treated areas. All participants thought both the 100 and 50 Hz pulse rate treatments were tolerable, and the pain (mean score & PLUSMN; SD; 2.2 & PLUSMN; 1.2) associated with each was identical. No unexpected or serious adverse events occurred.ConclusionAcoustic subcision delivered via rapid acoustic pulses at 100 Hz, compared to 50 Hz, provides equivalent improvement in the appearance of cellulite while maintaining a similar safety and efficacy profile. For both pulse rates, treatment pain was minimal, and participant satisfaction was high.

Colonisation could potentially help compensate for, or compound, resident diversity loss that results from global environmental change.We use a multifactorial seed addition grassland experiment to examine relationships between plant colonisation, resident species diversity and key community assembly factors over 3 years. By manipulating colonist seed rate, imposing disturbance and examining abundance and diversity impacts of 14 formerly absent sown colonists in communities that varied in successional stage and time since agricultural abandonment, we were able to disentangle effects of global change factors (species introduction, novel disturbance and land use change) that are usually confounded.Evidence suggested that cover abundance of sown colonists was most strongly influenced by successional stage of recipient communities, though number of growing seasons was also important for the group of seven colonists with resource conservative 'slow' life history traits. Colonist type, seed rate and disturbance had weaker relationships with colonist cover.Factors affecting sown colonist cover were highly conditional. A negative relationship between plot-level disturbance and colonist cover in early successional communities meant that, despite a positive relationship in late succession, colonisation was negatively related to disturbance overall, defying theoretical expectations.Non-sown resident diversity was negatively related to colonist cover and positively related to successional stage. Resource acquisitive colonists with 'fast' life history traits appeared to limit cover of 'slow colonists' when the two groups were sown together, likely reflecting niche pre-emption.Communities at earlier stages of succession had lower resident diversity and experienced higher levels of colonisation than communities at later stages of succession. Elevated colonisation and lower resident diversity both appeared to be symptoms of human-induced land use change. However, results suggested that resource competition from plant colonists may also limit resident diversity in grasslands abandoned from agriculture more recently.Synthesis. Our findings point to the importance of resource availability and competition on plant colonisation and colonist impacts on residents. Although colonisation is potentially a source of biodiversity in the short term, our results suggest that plant colonists that reach high abundance may be a further threat to resident plant diversity in secondary grasslands recovering from a recent history of agriculture. These findings point to the importance of resource availability and competition on plant colonisation and colonist impacts on residents. Although colonisation is potentially a source of biodiversity in the short term, our results suggest that plant colonists that reach high abundance may be a further threat to resident plant diversity in secondary grasslands recovering from a recent history of agriculture.image	[Catford, Jane A.; Shepherd, Harry E.

Vascular complications, which can lead to skin necrosis or permanent scarring, are a particularly dangerous complication and occur when the filler is injected directly into a blood vessel or when an adjacent blood vessel is compressed by the filler material.ObjectiveTo assess the clinical prognosis based on post-procedural management and clinical findings of HA filler vascular complications.MethodsHerein, we present a case series of vascular complications due to HA filler and evaluate their clinical prognosis based on post-procedural management and clinical findings. Clinical assessments were performed using Doppler ultrasound, thermography, and laboratory tests.ResultsFactors including white blood cell count, the time of treatment initiation, and time of hyaluronidase injection influenced the clinical outcomes. Early recognition and prompt hyaluronidase injection proved crucial in preventing further damage and improving prognosis.ConclusionThis case series highlights the importance of early detection and appropriate management of HA filler complications.

Development of a machine learning multiclass screening tool for periodontal health status based on non-clinical parameters and salivary biomarkers	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						artificial intelligence; multiclass prediction; periodontitis; random forest; screening	PERI-IMPLANT DISEASES; 2017 WORLD WORKSHOP; MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES; CONSENSUS REPORT; CLASSIFICATION; SURVEILLANCE; OBJECTIVES; DIAGNOSIS	Aim: To develop a multiclass non-clinical screening tool for periodontal disease and assess its accuracy for differentiating periodontal health, gingivitis and different stages of periodontitis.Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional diagnostic study on a convenience sample of 408 consecutive subjects was conducted by applying three non-clinical index tests estimating different features of the periodontal health-disease spectrum: a self-administered questionnaire, an oral rinse activated matrix metalloproteinase-8 (aMMP-8) point-of-care test (POCT) and determination of gingival bleeding on brushing (GBoB). Full-mouth periodontal examination was the reference standard. The periodontal diagnosis was made on the basis of the 2017 classification of periodontal diseases and conditions. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) analyses were performed to predict various periodontal diagnoses, and the accuracy measures were assessed.Results: Four-hundred and eight subjects were enrolled in this study, including those with periodontal health (16.2%), gingivitis (15.2%) and stage I (15.9%), stage II (15.9%), stage III (29.7%) and stage IV (7.1%) periodontitis. Nine predictors, namely 'gum disease' (Q1), 'a rating of gum/teeth health' (Q2), 'tooth cleaning' (Q3a), the symptom of 'loose teeth' (Q4), 'use of floss' (Q7), aMMP-8 POCT, self-reported GBoB, haemoglobin and age, resulted in high levels of accuracy in the RF classifier. High accuracy (area under the ROC curve > 0.94) was observed for the discrimination of three (health, gingivitis and periodontitis) and six classes (health, gingivitis, stages I, II, III and IV periodontitis). Confusion matrices showed that the misclassification of a periodontitis case as health or gingivitis was less than 1%-2%.Conclusions: Machine learning-based classifiers, such as RF analyses, are promising tools for multiclass assessment of periodontal health and disease in a non-clinical setting. Results need to be externally validated in appropriately sized independent samples (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03928080).

The model describes stem and progenitor cell dynamics in the small intestinal epithelium and integrates heterogeneous epithelial-related processes, such as transcriptional profiles, citrulline kinetics, and probability of diarrhea. We fitted a mouse-specific version of the model to quantify doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced toxicity, which included pharmacokinetics and 5-FU metabolism and assumed that both drugs led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in stem cells and proliferative progenitors. The model successfully recapitulated observations in mice regarding dose-dependent disruption of proliferation which could lead to villus shortening, decrease of circulating citrulline, increased diarrhea risk, and transcriptional induction of the p53 pathway. Using a human-specific epithelial model, we translated the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin and 5-FU quantified in mice into human intestinal injury and predicted with accuracy clinical diarrhea incidence. However, for gefitinib, a specific-molecularly targeted therapy, the mice failed to reproduce epithelial toxicity at exposures much higher than those associated with clinical diarrhea. This indicates that, regardless of the translational modeling approach, preclinical experimental settings have to be suitable to quantify drug-induced clinical toxicity with precision at the structural scale of the model. Our work demonstrates the usefulness of translational models at early stages of the drug development pipeline to predict clinical toxicity and highlights the importance of understanding cross-settings differences in toxicity when building these approaches.

In this retrospective register-based study, we evaluated the 16-year trajectory of this programme, utilising the Danish Red Blood Cell Centre's laboratory database, covering approximately 77% of the Danish population. During the study period, we observed a substantial increase in annual diagnostic examinations performed, from 389 in 2007 to 3030 in 2022. Women constituted 88% of these cases, aligning with the emphasis of the screening programme. Of these, 54% of women of reproductive age (15-40 years) and 10% of women >40 years were specified as pregnant. During our study period, 61 children were born with a severe haemoglobinopathy, out of which 23 children were born from mothers not residing in Denmark during their first trimester thus not included in the screening programme. Prenatal invasive testing was performed for 60 fetuses, identifying 12 with homozygous or compound heterozygous haemoglobinopathy. The Danish haemoglobinopathy screening programme has provided screening, information and reproductive choices for numerous families. During the study period, screening for haemoglobinopathies has been steadily increasing and is expected to continue to increase. Awareness of and adherence to the screening programme is subject of further investigation and optimisation.

In current work, multi-scale hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) fillers are integrated into polyetheretherketone (PEEK) polymer to create a synergistic effect regarding thermal conductivity. An optimized twin-screw extrusion is utilized to disperse the fillers uniformly in the host polymer by changing the screw design in terms of kneading, mixing, and reverse elements, feeding zones of the fillers/polymer, and the feeding cycles. Various specimens were developed by systematically varying the relative filler amount of the thermally anisotropic hBN and the thermally isotropic TiO2, while the total filler content was fixed to 60 wt%. As a result, 50B-10T composite exhibited an ultrahigh thermal conductivity of 8.195 W/(m.K), with a 3139% enhancement compared to unfilled PEEK. Moreover, as the PEEK-mediated regions are occupied with nano-sized TiO2, efficient channels for phonon transport are formed between hybrid fillers, and the through-plane thermal conductivity reached 1.704 W/(m.K) in 50B-10T sample. The potential application of prepared composites as a heat spreader is demonstrated by monitoring surface temperature distribution and numerical simulation. Meanwhile, we achieved a synchronous improvement in mechanical stiffness within hybrid composites; and failure mechanisms including crack bridging at TiO2-PEEK interface, and debonding at hBN-PEEK interface are observed in hybrid composites. Lastly, the high thermal stability makes the PEEK/hBN/TiO2 specimens suitable for heat dissipation in demanding applica-tions in the energy and aerospace sectors.

Experiment 1: a total of 140 growing pigs (24.47 +/- 2.49 kg) were used in a 6-week trial. There were four dietary treatment groups (seven replicate pens/treatment, five pigs/pen) and treatment diets composed of corn, soybean meal (SBM), distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), and rapeseed meal-based basal diets with 0%, 0.025%, 0.050% and 0.10% of micelle silymarin respectively. Experiment 2: A total of 18 pigs were divided into six treatment groups. Treatment diets: TRT1, TRT2 and TRT3 were basal diets with 30, 150 and 300 g powdered silymarin respectively; and TRT4, TRT5 and TRT6 were basal diets with 30, 150 and 300 g micelle-type silymarin respectively. Average daily gain (ADG) tended to increase (p < 0.10) at Week 3 and overall experiment after silymarin addition. Overall ADG and average daily feed intake are also intended to improve (p < 0.10) linearly in this study. During Week 6, growing pigs fed silymarin showed linearly increased (p < 0.05) apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, nitrogen and energy. Dietary silymarin supplementation increased (p < 0.10) linearly the faecal Lactobacillus count at Week 3 while Escherichia coli count was linearly decreased at both the 3rd week (p < 0.05) and 6th week (p < 0.10). Silymarin supplementation showed no effect on faecal gas emissions. A higher (p < 0.05) absorption rate in the blood was found in micelle-type silymarin compared to powdered silymarin after the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th and 24th h of feeding. Results suggest that silymarin in a corn-SBM-DDGS-rapeseed meal-based diet may help to improve ADG, FI, ATTD and faecal microflora in growing pigs. And absorption rate in the blood of pig is higher in micelle-type silymarin.

There are several markers for HPV-driven HNC, one being HPV early antigen serology. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of HPV serology and its performance across patient characteristics. Data from the VOYAGER consortium was used, which comprises five studies on HNC from North America and Europe. Diagnostic accuracy, that is, sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa and correctly classified proportions of HPV16 E6 serology, was assessed for OPC and other HNC using p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry (p16), HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) and HPV PCR as reference methods. Stratified analyses were performed for variables including age, sex, smoking and alcohol use, to test the robustness of diagnostic accuracy. A risk-factor analysis based on serology was conducted, comparing HPV-driven to non-HPV-driven OPC. Overall, HPV serology had a sensitivity of 86.8% (95% CI 85.1-88.3) and specificity of 91.2% (95% CI 88.6-93.4) for HPV-driven OPC using p16 as a reference method. In stratified analyses, diagnostic accuracy remained consistent across sex and different age groups. Sensitivity was lower for heavy smokers (77.7%), OPC without lymph node involvement (74.4%) and the ARCAGE study (66.7%), while specificity decreased for cases with <10 pack-years (72.1%). The risk-factor model included study, year of diagnosis, age, sex, BMI, alcohol use, pack-years, TNM-T and TNM-N stage. HPV serology is a robust biomarker for HPV-driven OPC, and its diagnostic accuracy is independent of age and sex. Future research is suggested on the influence of smoking on HPV antibody levels.

Aim: Our study presents a novel and significant contribution by developing an interpretable fusion model that effectively integrates both free-text medical record data and structured laboratory data to predict LM in postoperative CRC patients. Methods: We used a robust dataset of 1463 patients and leveraged state-of- the- art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to construct a two-layer fusion framework that demonstrates superior predictive performance compared to single modal models. Our innovative two-tier algorithm fuses the results from different data modalities, achieving balanced prediction results on test data and significantly enhancing the predictive ability of the model. To increase interpretability, we employed Shapley additive explanations to elucidate the contributions of free-text clinical data and structured clinical data to the final model. Furthermore, we translated our findings into practical clinical applications by creating a novel NLP score-based nomogram using the top 13 valid predictors identified in our study. Results: The proposed fusion models demonstrated superior predictive performance with an accuracy of 80.8%, precision of 80.3%, recall of 80.5%, and an F1 score of 80.8% in predicting LMs. Conclusion: This fusion model represents a notable advancement in predicting LMs for postoperative CRC patients, offering the potential to enhance patient outcomes and support clinical decision-making.

Specifically, several studies have focused on the impact of vitamins. However, due to variations in experimental conditions across all trials, drawing general conclusions appears challenging. Therefore, we conducted a meta -analysis of 17 published papers, including a maximum of 134 sample size to evaluate the potential effects of in ovo feeding of vitamins in broilers. Studies were retrieved by consulting scientific repositories such as Pubmed, Scopus, Scielo, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A binary logistic model was used to determine the parameters influencing hatchability. To assess variations in hatchling weight and growth parameters based on the vitamin category, a mixed model analysis of variance was performed, considering the study as a random effect and the vitamin category as a fixed effect. Finally, a linear mixed model was used to develop equations that explain the evolution of growth parameters based on vitamin concentration, volume, and day of injection. The results revealed that for better hatchability, it is preferable to consider heavier eggs (p = 0.007), lower volumes (p = 0.039), and late injection (p = 0.022). Vitamin E was associated with higher hatchling weight (p = 0.037), while vitamin C exhibited the lowest overall feed conversion ratio (p = 0.042). Interactions were observed between the day of injection and vitamin concentration or volume of injection for all studied growth parameters. In summary, the findings of this study suggest that hatchability during in ovo feeding is influenced by technique-related parameters, whereas growth parameters can be modulated by the category of vitamin injected. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future investigations assessing the effects of in ovo feeding in broilers, as it highlights the relationship between the methodology and potential outcomes.

J	Palm, HW; Knaus, U; Kotzen, B				Palm, Harry W.; Knaus, Ulrich; Kotzen, Benz			Aquaponics nomenclature matters: It is about principles and technologies and not as much about coupling	REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE			English	Review; Early Access						Agri-Aquaculture Systems; aquaorganoponics; aquaponics farming; nomenclature; nutrient supply; terminology	FRESH-WATER; FISH; AQUACULTURE; HYDROPONICS; HISTORY; QUALITY; PLANTS; BED	The food production system 'aquaponics' has moved a long way from its inceptions in the 1970s and 1980s. This paper suggests that it is the principle of aquaponics that should define what aquaponics is and then the rest follows according to systems and technologies. This paper supports the Palm et al. (Aquac Int. 2018;26(3):813-42) position of having a nutrient supply threshold (>50%) from the feed via the aquatic organisms to the plants. We test the most recent alternative definitions (e.g. Baganz et al. Rev Aquac. 2021;14:252-64) that overcomplicate existing definitions and nomenclature. Any new definition needs to be referential to existing terms and properly tested. This paper does exactly that, concluding that several recent changes by Baganz et al. (Rev Aquac. 2021;14:252-64) are not needed. We also debate that the key principle behind aquaponics is 'all about coupling'. Whilst coupling is an important aspect, existing technologies and those that will emerge are far more complex. Finally, this paper highlights the idiosyncrasies in the term aquaponics and we suggest an alternative term 'aquaorganoponics', which in essence better describes the principles of aquaponics (s.s.) which transfers natural organic compounds combined with microbes in water from the aquaculture unit to the plants.

Birdwatching- a cultural ecosystem service- is among the most popular outdoor recreational activities. Existing economic valuations of birdwatching typically overlook the economic contributions of birdwatchers travelling to see vagrant (out-of-range) birds.2. Economic valuations of vagrant birdwatching are few, and to date, no valuation of a large, charismatic vagrant species- or of a recurring individual vagrant bird- has been reported. 3. During 2020- 2022, a vagrant Steller's Sea- Eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) was re-ported in several locations in North America, representing the first record of this species in these locations. In Winter 2020- 2021, the eagle spent nearly a month on the eastern seaboard of the United States, and thousands of people travelled to see it.4. We conducted an online survey of individuals who travelled to see the eagle to estimate the individual and collective non-consumptive use value of this vagrant birdwatching event. Using individual travel cost methodology, we estimated an average individual expenditure and, together with estimates of the total number of birdwatchers, we estimated non-consumptive use value of the vagrant bird-watching event. Finally, we used a willingness to pay framework (via hypotheti-cal donations to view the eagle) to evaluate the non-consumptive use consumer surplus of the event.5. We estimated that, on average, individual birdwatchers spent $180 USD (95% CI= $156- $207) ignoring travel time- or $277 (95% CI= $243- $314) when ac- counting for travel time- to view the eagle. Furthermore, we estimated between 2115 and 2645 individuals travelled to see the eagle during December 2021 to January 2022. Thus, we estimated that the eagle generated a total expenditure between $380,604 and $476,626, or between $584,373 and $731,809 when ac- counting for travel time. Finally, based on travellers' willingness to pay, we esti-mated a non-consumptive use consumer surplus of the event between $139,036 and $174,114.6. Assigning economic value to nature gives policymakers and business leaders footing to advance conservation in decision-making. Although often overlooked in these decisions, vagrant birds supply ephemeral ecosystem services that might bolster community development efforts, particularly if vagrancy events occur with some predictability (e.g. recurring annually).

Metalation of POC-H (di-tert-butyl(phenoxy)phosphane) with [Ir(COD)Cl]2 proceeded rapidly at room temperature and afforded mixture of (POC)(POC-H)IrHCl (1 a) and (POC)(COD)IrHCl (1 b), from which complexes (POC)(L)IrHCl where L=PPh3 (1 c), bipyridine (1 d) and [2,2 & PRIME;-bipyridine]-6,6 & PRIME;-diol (1 e) were prepared through ligand exchange. The compounds were tested in acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol and transfer dehydrogenation of ethanol in a context of comparison with pincer counterparts (POCOP)IrHCl and (PCN)IrHCl. An attempt to prepare a dihydride complex from 1 e led to dimeric complex [(POC)(bipy-diol-)IrH]2 (3) that could explain the low activity of 1 e. DFT studies provided insight into POC-H vs POCOP-H metalation mechanism. Synthesis and characterization of cyclometalated iridium complexes (POC)(L)IrHCl with a bidentate POC ligand is presented. The catalytic activity of complexes (POC)(L)IrHCl in acceptorless dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol and transfer dehydrogenation of ethanol is discussed and compared to (POCOP)IrHCl and (PCN)IrHCl pincer complexes.image	[Polukeev, Alexey V.] Lund Univ, Ctr Anal & Synth, Dept Chem, POB 124, S-22100 Lund, Sweden	Lund University	Polukeev, AV (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Anal & Synth, Dept Chem, POB 124, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.	alexey.polukeev@chem.lu.se			The Royal Physiographic Society of Lund is gratefully acknowledged for the financial support.; Royal Physiographic Society of Lund	The Royal Physiographic Society of Lund is gratefully acknowledged for the financial support.; Royal Physiographic Society of Lund	The Royal Physiographic Society of Lund is gratefully acknowledged for the financial support.		94	0	0	4	4	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1434-1948	1099-0682		EUR J INORG CHEM	Eur.

The prognostic patterns of genes linked to cholesterol metabolism (CMAGs) in CESC, however, have received very little attention in research. From public databases, TCGA-CESC cohorts with mRNA expression patterns and the accompanying clinical information of patients were gathered. Consensus clustering was used to find the molecular subtype connected to cholesterol metabolism. In the TCGA-CESC cohort, a predictive risk model with 28 CMAGs was created using Lasso-Cox regression. The function enrichment analysis between groups with high-and low-risk were investigated by employing GO, KEGG, and GSVA software. The immune cell infiltration was analyzed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT, and MCPCOUNTER methods. Finally, we select 7 genes in risk model for further multivariate Cox analysis, and ultimately a hub gene, CHIT1, was identified. Meanwhile, the function of CHIT1 was preliminarily verified in cell and mice tumor model.

The 'Behavioral Balance Model': A new perspective on the aetiology and therapy of obesity	DIABETES OBESITY & METABOLISM			English	Review; Early Access						antidiabetic drug; appetite control; bariatric surgery; GLP-1 analogue; obesity therapy; weight control	EATING BEHAVIOR; WEIGHT-LOSS; FOOD-INTAKE; BRAIN; CONSEQUENCES; DISORDERS; OUTCOMES; HEALTH; STIGMA; REWARD	Obesity is a debilitating disease of global proportions that necessitates refined, concept-driven therapeutic approaches. Policy makers, the public and even health care professionals, but also individuals with obesity harbour many misconceptions regarding this disease, which leads to prejudice, negative attitudes, stigmatization, discrimination, self-blame, and failure to provide and finance adequate medical care. Decades of intensive, successful scientific research on obesity have only had a very limited effect on this predicament. We propose a science-based, easy-to-understand conceptual model that synthesizes the complex pathogenesis of obesity including biological, psychological, social, economic and environmental aspects with the aim to explain and communicate better the nature of obesity and currently available therapeutic modalities. According to our integrative 'Behavioral Balance Model', 'top-down cognitive control' strategies are implemented (often with limited success) to counterbalance the increased 'bottom-up drive' to gain weight, which is triggered by biological, psycho-social and environmental mechanisms in people with obesity. Besides offering a deeper understanding of obesity, the model also highlights why there is a strong need for multimodal therapeutic approaches that may not only increase top-down control but also reduce a pathologically increased bottom-up drive.

We inform the utilization of electrospinning to produce highly aligned small-diameter polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers where the multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) are coaxially aligned inside the PVDF nanofibers. The coaxially aligned MWCNTs arrange large numbers of contact sites with the polymer chains, thereby providing enhanced interfacial interactions, resulting in the superior effect of the MWCNTs on the crystalline structure and actuator response of the PVDF at low loading levels (0.06 wt.%). An effective alpha- to beta-phase conversion occurred through the synergistic effects of the electrospinning and MWCNTs, the beta-phase content reached 94%. Also, the degree of crystallinity increased up to 50% respecting the pure nanofibers. The bending actuation of the nanofibers was analyzed as the active layer of soft piezoelectric actuators in a unimorph configuration. The well-aligned nanofibers showed better actuator deflection than the randomly oriented nanofibers. Comparing the PVDF nanofiber-based actuators in the literature, our actuators exhibited excellent piezoelectric performance with high potential for practical applications.

This study was a randomized, double-blind, pseudo-controlled trial in which 45 ASD children were recruited and divided into three groups with sex, age, and rehabilitation treatment as control variables. Each group of 15 children with ASD was randomly administered active HD-tDCS with the Cz as the central anode, active HD-tDCS with the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3) as the central anode, and sham HD-tDCS with the Cz as the central anode with 14 daily sessions in 3 weeks. The Social Responsiveness Scale Chinese Version (SRS-Chinese Version) was compared 1 week after stimulation with values recorded 1 week prior to stimulation. At the end of treatment, both the anodal Cz and anodal left DLFPC tDCS decreased the measures of SRS-Chinese Version. The total score of SRS-Chinese Version decreased by 13.08%, social cognition decreased by 18.33%, and social communication decreased by 10.79%, which were significantly improved over the Cz central anode active stimulation group, especially in children with young age, and middle and low function. There was no significant change in the total score and subscale score of SRS-Chinese Version over the Cz central anode sham stimulation group. In the F3 central anode active stimulation group, the total score of SRS-Chinese Version decreased by 13%, autistic behavior decreased by 19.39%, and social communication decreased by 14.39%, which were all significantly improved. However, there was no significant difference in effect between the Cz and left DLPFC stimulation conditions. HD-tDCS of the Cz central anode may be an effective treatment for social dysfunction in children with ASD.Lay SummaryThis preliminary study showed that HD-tDCS at the Cz was feasible, safe, and potentially effective in improving the symptoms of ASD social dysfunction in children. HD-tDCS was well tolerated and no adverse reactions were reported. All participants showed significant improvements in social cognition, social understanding, verbal expression, and logical thinking. In addition, further research is needed to expand the sample size, including which types of ASD children are more likely to benefit from treatment.

Patients usually have spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and progressive steroid-resistant nephropathy that leads to kidney failure. However, their clinical course after kidney transplantation (KT) is not yet well known. Here, we present our experience with cases of SIOD treated at our institute.Case Presentation: Since 2014, three children have been diagnosed with nephropathy resulting from SIOD. They presented with proteinuria in the nephrotic range at 7, 5, and 3 years of age. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was confirmed and progressed to kidney failure approximately 2 years after proteinuria was detected. These patients underwent living-donor KT from their parents. After KT, Case 1 lost his graft within 7 months due to multi-organ failure caused by disseminated adenovirus infection and died. Case 2 experienced graft failure 5 years after KT due to acute rejection from poor compliance. In Case 3, the allograft was still functioning 6 years after KT with low-dose tacrolimus single medication (trough level < 5 ng/mL). Extra-renal manifestations progressed regardless of KT, namely, right renal vein thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension in Case 1, severe bilateral hip dysplasia and Moyamoya syndrome in Case 2, and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in Case 3, in addition to recurrent infection.Conclusion: In SIOD patients, KT is complicated with recurrent infections due to their inherent immune dysfunction. Additionally, extra-renal symptoms may render the patients morbid despite the recovery of kidney function.

In this study, 323 stratified soil samples from a brownfield in Jiangsu Province, China, were collected to assess the heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, As and Hg) contaminations. Contamination factor (Cfi), Nemerow pollution index (PIN) and enrichment factor (EFi) were evaluated to assess the heavy metal pollution, while sources of pollution were identified in combination with geo-statistical, correlations and principal components analysis. Moreover, transport of Ni in soil profiles over the next 30 years was simulated using HYDRUS. The vertical distribution revealed that the soil surface (0-10 cm) had the highest concentration of heavy metal contamination. ICP-MS measurements showed that the soil in the brownfield was enriched with Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, As and Hg, where Ni was the most severe and prevalent contaminant. The results of source apportionment analysis showed that Ni, Cd, Pb and Cu were mainly derived from building materials and sewage discharge, while As and Hg may come from fossil fuel combustion and agricultural discharges from upstream river catchment. The migration of Ni was largely driven by the combination of hydrological variability including the flow and solute contaminant gradients in soils. Our work highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of hydrology, and sewage discharge in heavy metal dynamics and migration pathways in China's brownfield soil at regional and national scales.

A coupled model integrating piezoelectric and semiconducting properties is developed with a finite element method to better understand the phenomena involved in this kind of device made with a process including chemical bath deposition of the nanostructures and their polymer encapsulation. Free carriers and surface traps are taken into account to give some keys to explain differences between previous theoretical and experimental works. This model is first validated on a single nanowire with a 1016 cm-3 n-doping level by comparison with analytical calculations. For this comparison, surface traps are not taken into account as no analytical solution is available considering them. Second, n-doping levels (between 1012 and 1018 cm-3) and surface traps densities (between 108 and 1012 cm-2) lead to variations of the generated piezopotential of two orders of magnitude. The control of these two semiconducting properties is a real challenge for this kind of application. Furthermore, simulation results show that the benefic effect of 1-3 piezo-composite is still present even for a high n-doping level of 1018 cm-3. A model for Finite Element Method is proposed for nanogenerator and energy harvesting. This model couples both piezoelectric and semiconducting phenomena using a bidirectional way to solve the relative equations. Thanks to this model, the influence of the free charge carriers and the surface traps is directly added to all key parameters like the energy level of the traps.image	[Dumons, Emmanuel; Tran-Huu-Hue, Louis Pascal; Poulin-Vittrant, Guylaine] Univ Tours, INSA Ctr Val Loire, GREMAN, CNRS,UMR 7347, 3 Rue Chocolaterie,CS 23410, F-41034 Blois, France	Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Tours	Dumons, E (corresponding author), Univ Tours, INSA Ctr Val Loire, GREMAN, CNRS,UMR 7347, 3 Rue Chocolaterie,CS 23410, F-41034 Blois, France.	emmanuel.dumons@insa-cvl.fr		DUMONS, Emmanuel/0009-0002-8593-3709; TRAN HUU HUE, Louis Pascal/0000-0003-4182-5247	The authors gratefully acknowledge the CNRS Institute for Engineering and Systems Sciences (INSIS), who supports the "Grappillage" project (Gathering of mechanical energy to power sensors for human health monitoring).

However, the impact of Wnt10b knockdown on the function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is yet largely unknown. Here, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to generate Wnt10b-knockdown (Wnt10b+/-) mice. We compared the development and thermogenic gene expression of interscapular BAT (iBAT) between Wnt10b+/- and Wnt10b+/+ mice under a chow diet, high-fat diet (HFD), and cold exposure conditions. Moreover, the effect of Wnt10b knockdown on brown adipocyte function was tested via in vitro experiments. Results indicated that Wnt10b knockdown decreased the iBAT mass and the brown adipocyte size and enhanced thermogenic gene expression, including UCP1, under chow diet conditions. In addition, Wnt10b+/- mice appeared to be able to maintain their body temperature better than the control in a cold environment, accompanied by higher UCP1 protein expression. Intriguingly, even under HFD conditions, Wnt10b+/- mice still showed higher UCP1 expression, which was associated with an alleviated obesity phenotype. In vitro studies further evidenced the Wnt10b knockdown stimulation of UCP1 expression and suppression of the adipogenic program. This study indicates that Wnt10b knockdown enhances UCP1 expression and inhibits the adipogenic differentiation of brown adipocytes, providing a novel option for therapeutic interventions in adiposity.

The investigations are accomplished by the adoption of first-principle methods established on spin-polarized density functional theory, based on the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method as implemented in the WIEN2k code, where the electronic exchange-correlation potential is studied by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBEsol) and the revised TB-mBJ rapprochement. The negative formation energy and elastic constant that are acquired indicate the thermodynamical and mechanical stability of all these structures. The ternary Sr0.875Mn0.125O alloys for all structures show half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior with a spin polarization of 100 % at the Fermi level, except the B2 phase without unrelaxed structure (URS). The total magnetic moments are 5 mu B for all compounds and the interaction is ferromagnetic between Mn-Sr and Mn-O sites. Optical properties such as refractive index and the optical reflectivity for these alloys are computed and discussed. These materials are half-metallic ferromagnets, and they can be desirable applicants for spintronics implementations and ultraviolet spectra.

Reliability of simulating internal precipitation variability over multi-timescales using multiple global climate model large ensembles in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; internal precipitation variability; multi-timescale; single model initial-condition large ensembles	INSIGHTS	Single model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) are valuable means to study the role of internal climate variability (ICV) in climate change. However, the ability of SMILEs to represent the multi-timescale ICV is not fully understood, especially in the region of China. The main objective of this work is to assess the ability of six advanced SMILEs with ensemble members ranging from 30 to 100 in simulating ICV of precipitation at various timescales in China, using a set of observational datasets as the benchmark. To have a first insight into the selected models, the mean states and trends of annual precipitation were evaluated at the very beginning. The ICV of precipitation was then calculated at multiple timescales by two widely used methods of representing temporal variability and intermember variability. The minimum required ensemble size for each climate model to robustly capture the true value of ICV is investigated at last. The results show that the multiple SMILEs can capture the basic spatial distribution pattern of ICV across timescales. However, the ICV represented by temporal variability underestimates observed ICV in most regions across timescales. The ICV represented by intermember variability is similar to that represented by temporal variability at the interannual and interdecadal timescales, but significantly larger at the multidecadal timescales. Within +/- 10% error limit, 20-30 members are sufficient for all climate models at the interannual timescale while ensemble sizes of 74% or more of the full sizes for each climate model are needed at multidecadal timescales.

Herein, a TME-responsive nanoplatform named PMICApt/ICG, based on PB:Mn & Ir@CaCO3Aptamer/ICG, is designed for the competent synergistic photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) under the guidance of photothermal and magnetic resonance imaging. The nanoplatform's aptamer modification targeting the transferrin receptor and the epithelial cell adhesion molecule on breast cancer cells, and the acid degradable CaCO3 shell allow for effective tumor accumulation and TME-responsive payload release in situ. The nanoplatform also exhibits excellent PDT properties due to its ability to generate O-2 and consume antioxidant GSH in tumors. Additionally, the synergistic therapy is achieved by a single wavelength of near-infrared laser. RNA sequencing is performed to identify differentially expressed genes, which show that the expressions of proliferation and migration-associated genes are inhibited, while the apoptosis and immune response gene expressions are upregulated after the synergistic treatments. This multifunctional nanoplatform that responds to the TME to realize the on-demand payload release and enhance PDT induced by TME modulation holds great promise for clinical applications in tumor therapy.

Applicant reactions to algorithm- versus recruiter-based evaluations of an asynchronous video interview and a personality inventory	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						algorithms; applicant reactions; asynchronous video interviews	SELECTION PROCEDURES; ORGANIZATIONAL ATTRACTIVENESS; OUTCOME FAVORABILITY; PERSONNEL-SELECTION; SOCIAL-EXCHANGE; JOB CHOICE; SELF; FAIRNESS; EXPLANATIONS; DECISIONS	In two studies, we examined the effects of algorithm based (vs. recruiter-based) evaluations of an asynchronous video interview and a personality inventory on applicant reactions. In line with our expectations, we found several negative applicant reactions to the use of algorithms. Specifically, in Study 1 (N = 172), informing participants that an algorithm, rather than a recruiter, had analysed their interview and personality inventory increased feelings of emotional creepiness, and reduced fairness perceptions, perceived predictive validity and feedback acceptance. In Study 2 (N = 276), we were able to replicate these effects for fairness perceptions and perceived predictive validity. Furthermore, in both studies, algorithm based evaluations negatively affected feedback acceptance, organizational attraction and job acceptance intentions through fairness perceptions. However, in contrast with our expectations, selection decision favour ability did not influence the impact of evaluation source (recruiter vs. algorithm) on applicant reactions. In Study 2, we also found some tentative evidence that applicant reactions to algorithm based evaluations are not affected by the type of information source (i.e. verbal vs. nonverbal cues) on which the algorithm is based.

This systematic review aims to explore the evidence on the use of AI and digital health in improving primary health care service delivery.MethodsThree electronic databases were searched using a comprehensive search strategy without providing any restriction in June 2023. Retrieved articles were screened independently using the "Rayyan" software. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two review authors. A narrative synthesis of the included interventions was conducted.ResultsA total of 4596 articles were screened, and finally, 48 articles were included from 21 different countries published between 2013 and 2021. The main focus of the included studies was noncommunicable diseases (n = 15), maternal and child health care (n = 11), primary care (n = 8), infectious diseases including tuberculosis, leprosy, and HIV (n = 7), and mental health (n = 6). Included studies considered interventions using AI, and digital health of which mobile-phone-based interventions were prominent. m-health interventions were well adopted and easy to use and improved the record-keeping, service deliver, and patient satisfaction.ConclusionAI and the application of digital technologies improve primary health care service delivery in resource-poor settings in various ways. However, in most of the cases, the application of AI and digital health is implemented through m-health. There is a great scope to conduct further research exploring the interventions on a large scale.	[Saif-Ur-Rahman, K. M.] Univ Galway, Coll Med Nursing & Hlth Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Saif-Ur-Rahman, K.

A total of 51 subjects were recruited, including 28 PTB and 23 TB children. The intelligence scale and MRI scan were completed at the corrected age of 10 to 16 years. A whole-brain voxel-wise analysis tested the main effect of the status (PTB without magnesium, PTB with magnesium, and TB) using a factorial design in SPM8. The mean volumes of the regions that showed significant group effects on the GMV after the FDR correction were extracted in the common space for each subject. Verbal and full-scale intelligence quotient scores were significantly lower for PTB children without magnesium than for TB children; however, the scores of PTB children with magnesium and TB children were almost identical. Compared with TB children, PTB children had significantly reduced left straight gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus GMVs; however, the volumes of PTB children with magnesium were closer to those of TB children. Changes in the GMV of the left inferior frontal gyrus were significantly correlated with full-scale and verbal intelligence quotient scores, whereas the lower gestational age at the time of mgsou4 treatment led to a larger GMV of the left inferior frontal gyrus. Brain structural abnormalities could exist in PTB children. The GMVs of the left straight gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus were significantly reduced in these children.

It has been reported that circular RNA (circRNA) is a key regulatory factor of MF progression. In this study, we revealed that circ_0002295 and CXCR2 were elevated, and miR-1287 was reduced in MF patients. Knockdown of circ_0002295 effectively suppressed the proliferation, migration and MF progression. Circ_0002295 was the molecular sponge of miR-12878, and miR-1287 inhibitor reversed the biological functions of circ_0002295 on the myocardial fibrosis. CXCR2 was a target gene of miR-1287, and CXCR2 silencing relieved the impacts of miR-1287 inhibitor on cardiac myofibroblasts. Circ_0002295 promoted MF progression by regulating the miR-1287/CXCR2 axis, providing a possible circRNA-targeted therapy for MF.

J	Mcnamara, K; Lund, M				Mcnamara, Kathleen; Lund, Mary			The future of parenting plan evaluations: A view from the trenches	FAMILY COURT REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						child custody evaluation; family forensic evaluation; parenting plan evaluation		As expectations rise for parenting plan evaluators to be well-trained, skilled, and knowledgeable in numerous subject areas, and scrutiny of evaluators' work intensifies, the pool of qualified evaluators is shrinking nationwide. The future of parenting plan evaluation as a forensic subspecialty relies upon the availability of competent and committed professionals to do this challenging work, yet few are entering the field. Five experienced parenting plan evaluators from various regions of the United States, including the authors, met for a roundtable discussion to ponder the future of parenting plan evaluations. The panel discussed what drew them to the work, their experiences "in the trenches," and what has kept them committed to doing evaluations despite daunting challenges. Their views of the rewards and risks of doing the work, barriers and disincentives to newcomers entering the field, recommendations to new evaluators, and outlook for the future are presented. Parenting plan evaluation ("PPE") is a well-established forensic subspecialty with rigorous expectations for training, skills, and knowledge. Scrutiny of the work can be high and professional risks daunting.Despite rising costs, the need for comprehensive PPEs that are well-rooted in science, scholarship, and the law continues for a relatively small portion of family law cases.Keeping costs down in order to adequately serve the number of children and families in need is a constant pressure on PPEs.Systemic disincentives and barriers for those who would otherwise enter the field are likely contributing to the dwindling pool of qualified evaluators rather than challenges of the work itself.Preparing and incentivizing experienced evaluators to serve as supervisors and consultants to new PPEs is much needed, along with triaging cases to match them with appropriate services. Effective and affordable alternatives to comprehensive PPEs are also needed.				kathleenmcnamaraphd@gmail.com			The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Chioma Ajoku, JD, PhD, APBB, Christy Bradshaw Schmidt, MA, LPC, and Sol Rappaport, PhD, ABPP to this article.

J	Nazarov, A; Postnova, O; Scrimshaw, T				Nazarov, Anton; Postnova, Olga; Scrimshaw, Travis			Skew Howe duality and limit shapes of Young diagrams	JOURNAL OF THE LONDON MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY-SECOND SERIES			English	Article; Early Access							SCHENSTED-TYPE CORRESPONDENCE; CLASSICAL LIE-GROUPS; Q-ANALOG; SPINOR REPRESENTATIONS; SYMMETRICAL GROUP; HARMONIC-ANALYSIS; BRANCHING-RULES; VICIOUS WALKERS; ASYMPTOTICS; TABLEAUX	We consider the skew Howe duality for the action of certain dual pairs of Lie groups (G1,G2)$(G_1, G_2)$ on the exterior algebra ⋀(Cn & OTIMES;Ck)$\bigwedge (\mathbb {C}<^>{n} \otimes \mathbb {C}<^>{k})$ as a probability measure on Young diagrams by the decomposition into the sum of irreducible representations. We prove a combinatorial version of this skew Howe duality for the pairs (GLn,GLk)$(GL_{n}, GL_{k})$, (SO2n+1,Pin2k)$(SO_{2n+1}, \operatorname{Pin}_{2k})$, (Sp2n,Sp2k)$(Sp_{2n}, Sp_{2k})$, and (O2n,SOk)$(O_{2n}, SO_{k})$ using crystal bases, which allows us to interpret the skew Howe duality as a natural consequence of lattice paths on lozenge tilings of certain partial hexagonal domains. The G1$G_1$-representation multiplicity is given as a determinant formula using the Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot lemma and as a product formula. These admit natural q$q$-analogs that we show equals the q$q$-dimension of a G2$G_2$-representation (up to an overall factor of q$q$), giving a refined version of the combinatorial skew Howe duality. Using these product formulas (at q=1$q =1$), we take the infinite rank limit and prove that the diagrams converge uniformly to the limit shape.

There have been various extensions of the Miura transformation, which have been used to relate different kinds of integrable equations and to classify the bi-Hamiltonian structures. In this paper, we are mainly concerned with the geometric aspects of the Miura transformation. The generalized Miura transformations from the mKdV-type hierarchies to the KdV-type hierarchies are constructed under both algebraic and geometric settings. It is shown that the Miura transformations not only relate integrable curve flows in different geometries but also induce the transition between different moving frames. Moreover, the Miura transformation gives the factorization of generating operators of constraint Gelfand-Dickey hierarchy. Other geometric formulations are also investigated.

In response to the need for a reliable and valid patient reported outcome measurement tool for major surgical resections in Norway. The Norwegian Registry for Gastrointestinal Surgery (NORGAST) initiated a project to translate and evaluate QoR-15's psychometric properties for patients going through general, gastrointestinal (GI), and hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) resectional surgery. Methods: After a translation and adaption of the original version of QoR-15 into Norwegian, the QoR-15NO was psychometrically evaluated including a confirmatory factor analysis to test for unidimensionality, as well as tests for content validity, internal consistency, measurement error, construct validity, feasibility, and responsiveness. This process included cognitive interviews using a structured interview guide. Further, patients who underwent various types of GI/HPB surgery at five hospitals in different parts of Norway completed the QoR-15NO before surgery and on the first or second day after surgery. The impact of surgery was classified according to Surgical Outcome Risk Tool v2 (SORT), in extra major/complex, major, intermediate, and minor. Results: This study included 324 patients with 83% return rate with both pre- and postoperative forms. There were negative correlations between duration of surgery and postoperative QoR-15 score and the difference between post- and preoperative score (change score). Individuals who had gone through surgery with major impact had a lower postoperative mean QoR-15 score (97) than their counterparts who had experienced either medium (QoR-15: 110) or minor (QoR15: 119) impact surgery. Cronbach's alpha (0.88) and Omega Alpha Total (omega t = 0.90) indicate that the scale has good to very good internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was measured by Intra-class Correlation Coefficient to ICC = 0.70. Confirmatory factor analyses supported that a one-factor model with correlated residuals had a good fit to data. Conclusion: This study supports QoR-15NO as a valid, essentially unidimensional, feasible, and responsive instrument among patients undergoing general, GI, and HPB resectional surgery in Norway. The total QoR-15NO score provides important information that can be used in an everyday clinical setting and integrated into NORGAST.

All studies reporting the histologic diagnosis of an EA. We collected the following data: patient's age, size and location of adenomyoma, presence of endometriosis and adenomyosis, past gynecologic treatment, symptoms, diagnostic imaging, surgical intervention, alternative/adjuvant treatment, associated malignancy, and follow up.ResultsSixty-seven studies with 85 patients were included. Pain was the most frequent symptom (69.5%). Among diagnostic examinations, ultrasonography was used in 60 out of 81 reported cases, with several radiologic features described. EA was located inside the pelvis in 77.6% of patients. Adnexa were the most frequent site of the disease (24, 28.2%). History of endometriosis or adenomyosis was described in 35 patients (35, 41.2%). Uterine tissue morcellation was reported in 6 of the 85 patients (7.1%). Associated malignancy was detected in 9 out of 85 patients with available data (10.6%). There were two recurrences of disease.ConclusionSpecific imaging features of EA are yet to be described in the literature. History of endometriosis and adenomyosis or uterine tissue morcellation may be suggestive of EA. Histologic examination can give a definitive diagnosis and exclude malignant transformation. Extrauterine adenomyoma is a rare disease with a challenging preoperative diagnosis due to its non-specific clinical characteristics.

Elemental analysis of vertebrae discerns diadromous movements of threatened non-marine elasmobranchs	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						habitat use; laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; life history; microchemical analysis; river sharks; sawfish	SHARK CARCHARHINUS-FALCIFORMIS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; OTOLITH CHEMISTRY; AGE; GROWTH; WATER; FISHES; LIMITATIONS; ASSUMPTIONS; HYPOTHESES	River sharks (Glyphis spp.) and some sawfishes (Pristidae) inhabit riverine environments, although their long-term habitat use patterns are poorly known. We investigated the diadromous movements of the northern river shark (Glyphis garricki), speartooth shark (Glyphis glyphis), narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), and largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis) using in situ laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) on vertebrae to recover elemental ratios over each individual's lifetime. We also measured elemental ratios for the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and a range of inshore and offshore stenohaline marine species to assist in interpretation of results. Barium (Ba) was found to be an effective indicator of freshwater use, whereas lithium (Li) and strontium (Sr) were effective indicators of marine water use. The relationships between Ba and Li and Ba and Sr were negatively correlated, whereas the relationship between Li and Sr was positively correlated. Both river shark species had elemental signatures indicative of prolonged use of upper-estuarine environments, whereas adults appear to mainly use lower-estuarine environments rather than marine environments. Decreases in Li:Ba and Sr:Ba at the end of the prenatal growth zone of P. pristis samples indicated that parturition likely occurs in fresh water. There was limited evidence of prolonged riverine habitat use for A. cuspidata. The results of this study support elemental-environment relationships observed in teleost otoliths and indicate that in situ LA-ICP-MS elemental characterization is applicable to a wide range of elasmobranch species as a discriminator for use and movement across salinity gradients. A greater understanding of processes that lead to element incorporation in vertebrae, and relative concentrations in vertebrae with respect to the ambient environment, will improve the applicability of elemental analysis to understand movements across the life history of elasmobranchs into the future.

However, their lower yield and production rate is one of the foremost challenges that need an instant sustainable approach. The use of nanotechnology is a potential approach for the enhanced generation of biohydrogen, owing to the significant characteristics of the nanomaterials such as greater specificity, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, better reactivity and dispersibility, enhanced catalytic activity, superb selectivity, greater electron transfer, and better anaerobic microbiota activity. This article explores the recent trends and innovations in the production of biohydrogen from wastewater through the applications of different nanomaterials. The potential of various nanomaterials employed for biohydrogen production from wastewater is evaluated and the impacts of important parameters such as the concentration and size of the nanomaterials, temperature, and pH on the production and yield of biohydrogen are explained in detail. Several pathways involved in the mechanistic approach of biohydrogen generation from wastewater are critically assessed. Lastly, numerous technological challenges are highlighted and recommendations regarding future research are also provided. The present review describes an overview of the role of nanomaterials in biohydrogen production from wastewater.image	[Ihsanullah, I.] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Chem & Water Desalinat Engn Program, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Bilal, Muhammad] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Chem Engn, Peshawar 25120, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Tariq] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Dept Sci & Environm Studies, Tai Po, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	University of Sharjah; University of Engineering & Technology Peshawar; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK)	Ihsanullah, I (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, Chem & Water Desalinat Engn Program, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.	engr.ihsan.dir@gmail.com	Ihsanullah, Ihsanullah/B-6245-2016	Ihsanullah, Ihsanullah/0000-0003-1249-6210					78	0	0	4	4	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1861-4728	1861-471X		CHEM-ASIAN J	Chem.-Asian J.	2023 SEP 8	2023										10.1002/asia.202300618	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asia.202300618		SEP 2023	17	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry	Q9US9	37642141				2023-10-18	WOS:001060901400001

The deviation angles every 6 months after surgery, periods of exodrift stabilization and surgical outcomes were analysed. The period of postoperative exodrift stabilization was defined as when exodrift was no longer significantly different from that at the next visit (p > 0.05). An alignment of 5 PD (prism diopters) esotropia to 10 PD exotropia at a distance and near fixation was considered surgical success.Results The mean angle of exodeviation was significantly different among surgical procedures at postoperative 1 month (BLR > ULR > R & R, p < 0.001); however, there were no differences among the procedures at 6 months (p = 0.088). The periods of exodrift stabilization were 6 months after ULR, 1 year after BLR and 4.5 years after R & R. The surgical success and reoperation rates did not show significant differences among procedures at the final follow-up.Conclusion Patients undergoing R & R showed smaller exodeviation shortly after surgery but required a longer period to stabilize the exodrift. Following ULR, exodeviation was larger in the early postoperative period, but the exodrift was stabilized earlier. Therefore, the long-term surgical outcomes were similar among ULR, BLR and R & R.

Data/Sources: Medline (Pub Med), CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library and Dentistry and Oral Health Sciences Source were searched for the results after applying the search strategy from January 2012 to May 2022, following inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data were collected using a self-made data collection form on study characteristics, population attributes and the main features, including the study's outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently evaluated based on the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for cross-sectional studies and the Risk of Biasness Tool-1 (Rob-1) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A descriptive analysis of the included studies was done using SWiM guidelines. The impact of charcoal and non-charcoal brushes on toothbrush disinfection was quantitatively analysed using a forest plot. Study Selection: Of the 687 studies screened by title and abstract, 27 articles were selected for full-text evaluation using the EndNote reference program (Ver. X9.2). From these, 15 qualified and were included in the systematic review. Among the selected studies, eight were RCTs, six were cross-sectional studies, and the remaining one was an in vitro experimental study. Conclusions: The toothbrush becomes contaminated even after its first usage, and the contamination level rises with continued use. There are a number of factors that lead to the contamination of brushes, such as increased humidity brought on by a plastic cover or a toilet setting. Charcoal brushes show significant efficacy as compared to regular bristles in reducing toothbrush contamination; however, more RCTs are needed to further assess its efficacy. Nevertheless, rinsing with chlorhexidine mouthwash after daily brushing shows favourable results.

In the past decade, nanoporous materials, as promising filler components for high-performance mixed matrix membranes (MMMs), have seen a boom given the merits of remarkable chemical and structural variability. However, it remains challenging to address the trade-off effect of MMMs between molecular/ionic selectivity and permeability. Biological ion channels that penetrate through cell membranes have provided new insights for the construction of novel structures of MMMs. In recent years, MMMs with cell membrane-like structures have gained much attention and achieved significant progress in the field of separation. In this minireview, recent advances in the design and construction of MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels are summarized. After that, the applications of these MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels in gas separation and ion sieving are highlighted and discussed in detail. Finally, the future developments and challenges for the MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels are prospected. Cell membranes with penetrating ion channels have unique pathways for efficient transportation of molecules and ions, providing an excellent model for the construction of high-performance mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). In this minireview, recent advances in the design and construction of MMMs with penetrating subnanochannels as well as their applications in gas separation and ion sieving are discussed in detail.image	[Li, Chen; Zhang, Pengchao] Wuhan Univ Technol Xiangyang Demonstrat Zone, Hubei Longzhong Lab, Xiangyang 441000, Peoples R China; [Li, Chen; Chen, Xiao; Huang, Cheng; Cheng, Sha; Xu, Shiqing; Zhang, Pengchao; Chen, Wen] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synth & Proc, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yanan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Chem, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pengchao] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sanya Sci & Educ Innovat Pk, Sanya 572024, Peoples R China	Wuhan University of Technology; Beijing Normal University; Wuhan University of Technology	Zhang, PC (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol Xiangyang Demonstrat Zone, Hubei Longzhong Lab, Xiangyang 441000, Peoples R China.; Zhang, PC (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Adv Technol Mat Synth & Proc, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.; Jiang, YA (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Chem, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Zhang, PC (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sanya Sci & Educ Innovat Pk, Sanya 572024, Peoples R China.	yananjiang@bnu.edu.cn; pczhang@whut.edu.cn	Jiang, Yanan/IWM-0686-2023	Jiang, Yanan/0000-0002-4335-1383	National key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFA0715700]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [22202157, 22174146]; Independent Innovation Projects of the Hubei Longzhong Laboratory [2022ZZ-34]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [BNU: 310421126]	National key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Independent Innovation Projects of the Hubei Longzhong Laboratory; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)	C.

The simulation results show that thermal cycling causes the NC NiTi SMAs to repeatedly undergo martensitic phase transformation and inverse phase transformation processes. The martensitic phase transformation capability is suppressed with increasing porosity and number of cycles, but the suppression effect of thermal cycling is weakened with increasing porosity. Moreover, the start temperature of martensitic transformation, residual martensitic phase, and the fraction of interstitial atoms increase with increasing porosity. Thermal cycling causes the disordered structures and shear plastic deformation to accumulate as cycling increases. Recoverable shear deformation is generated within the grain, but shear plastic deformation is mainly concentrated at both grain boundaries and pore surfaces. Residual martensitic phase increases after thermal cycling. These results provide important explanations and references for a deeper understanding of phase transformation behavior and pore effects caused by thermal cycling. Effects of thermal cycling and porosity on phase transformation of porous nanocrystalline NiTi shape memory alloys are studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The temperature-induced martensitic phase transformation behavior under thermal cycling is investigated at the atomic scale. The average atomic volume, atomic structure, phase fraction, and shear strain distribution during thermal cycling are analyzed.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH	[Liu, Bingfei; Wang, Yuyang] Civil Aviat Univ China, Aviat Engn Inst, Tianjin 300300, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenping] Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Engn Mech, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenping] Wuhan Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518063, Peoples R China	Civil Aviation University of China; Wuhan University; Wuhan University	Wu, WP (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Engn Mech, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.; Wu, WP (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen 518063, Peoples R China.	wpwu@whu.edu.cn		Wang, Yuyang/0000-0003-0807-7179	National Natural Science Foundation of China [12172259]; Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation [2023A1515012745]; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin [21JCYBJC00750]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China [3122023PY08]; Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students [2021YJS080]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin(Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students	The authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 12172259), Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (grant no. 2023A1515012745), Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin (grant no. 21JCYBJC00750), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (grant no. 3122023PY08), and Tianjin Research Innovation Project for Postgraduate Students (grant no. 2021YJS080).		47	0	0	4	4	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1438-1656	1527-2648		ADV ENG MATER	Adv.

INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						artificial intelligence; machine learning; software; medical device; clinical decision support systems; human factors and ergonomics		The question of whether the time has come to hang up the stethoscope is bound up in the promises of artificial intelligence (AI), promises that have so far proven difficult to deliver, perhaps because of the mismatch between the technical capability of AI and its use in real-world clinical settings. This perspective argues that it is time to move away from discussing the generalised promise of disembodied AI and focus on specifics. We need to focus on how the computational method underlying AI, i.e. machine learning (ML), is embedded into tools, how those tools contribute to clinical tasks and decisions and to what extent they can be relied on. Accordingly, we pose four questions that must be asked to make the discussion real and to understand how ML tools contribute to health care: (1) What does the ML algorithm do? (2) How is output of the ML algorithm used in clinical tools? (3) What does the ML tool contribute to clinical tasks or decisions? (4) Can clinicians act or rely on the ML tool? Two exemplar ML tools are examined to show how these questions can be used to better understand the role of ML in supporting clinical tasks and decisions. Ultimately, ML is just a fancy method of automation. We show that it is useful in automating specific and narrowly defined clinical tasks but likely incapable of automating the full gamut of decisions and tasks performed by clinicians.

CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						ammonia synthesis; electrochemistry; lithium; organic electrolyte electrolysis; solid-electrolyte interphase	PROPYLENE CARBONATE; AMMONIA-SYNTHESIS; EFFICIENCY	The lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li-NRR) is a promising method for decentralized ammonia synthesis using renewable energy. An organic electrolyte is utilized to combat the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, and lithium is plated to activate the inert N2 molecule. Ethanol is commonly used as a proton shuttle to provide hydrogen to the activated nitrogen. In this study, we investigate the role of ethanol as a proton shuttle in an electrolyte containing tetrahydrofuran and 0.2 M lithium perchlorate. Particularly designed electrochemical experiments show that ethanol is necessary for a good solid-electrolyte interphase but not for the synthesis of ammonia. In addition, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) demonstrates that the SEI formation at the onset of lithium plating is of specific importance. Chemical batch synthesis of ammonia combined with real-time mass spectrometry confirms that protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode by other species even without ethanol. Moreover, it raises questions regarding the electrochemical nature of Li-NRR. Finally, we discuss electrolyte stability and electrochemical electrode potentials, highlighting the role of ethanol on electrolyte degradation. The crucial ethanol-formed solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li-nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) enables ammonia synthesis, even in an ethanol-free electrolyte. The role of ethanol goes beyond acting as a proton shuttle; it facilitates a good SEI and participates in electrolyte transformations.image	[Mygind, Jon Bjarke Valbaek; Pedersen, Jakob B.; Li, Katja; Deissler, Niklas H.; Saccoccio, Mattia; Fu, Xianbiao; Li, Shaofeng; Sazinas, Rokas; Andersen, Suzanne Z.; Vesborg, Peter C.

The lack of awareness portrays the fruit as undervalued and neglected, despite its vast nutritional benefits. The study aimed to explore the physicochemical properties of fresh and dried karonda fruit and its application in formulating a jam product. The physicochemical parameters, including pH, acidity, reducing sugars, moisture content, ash content, and others, were analyzed for both fresh and dried fruits. The phytochemical characteristics, such as vitamin C, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, flavonoids, and anthocyanin content, were examined. The fruit extract was also subjected to antibacterial test using the well plate method. The fresh karonda berries have the highest levels of vitamin C, total phenolic, and anthocyanin contents, which can enhance the immune system and improve overall health. Jam formulations were created using varying proportions of karonda and apple pulp. These formulations were subsequently analyzed for their physicochemical, phytochemical, and sensory quality attributes. The results indicated that the pH, moisture content, ash content, ascorbic acid content, total phenolics, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity of the jams fell within the acceptable range as outlined by the Codex Alimentarius. Furthermore, the inclusion of apple pulp can enhance the taste and color of the jam while preserving its nutritional value. The sensory evaluation results revealed that T3, consisting of 50% karonda and 50% apple, followed by T4, comprising 25% karonda and 75% apple, were favored in terms of taste and color. This research offers significant insights for both the food industry and consumers, emphasizing the karonda fruit's potential as a valuable source of phytochemical compounds and its possible utilization in the creation of jams and other food products. This discovery promotes the consumption of this indigenous fruit due to its nutritional value and potential health benefits.

Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						bioengineering; lumenogenesis; melt electrospinning writing; organoids; scaffolds; stem cells	MORPHOGENESIS; GENERATION; MIGRATION; GEOMETRY; SURFACE; GROWTH; MOUSE	3D organoids are widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low-throughput culture methods, coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity, restrict the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, melt electrospinning writing is used to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self-organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. Grid geometry is shown to be a key determinant of stem cell self-organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature-controlled tissue growth. Two distinct methods for culturing scaffold-grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids are reported. These scaffolds provide a high-throughput method to generate, culture, and analyze large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labor involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. It is anticipated that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high-throughput screening. A scaffold-based platform to increase the throughput, reproducibility, and geometric control of 3D organoids is presented. Melt electrowriting is used to generate fibrous scaffolds that guide the self-organization of pluripotent stem cells into a large array of suspended interconnected or discrete organoids. Tuning the geometry of the scaffold enables to control the shape and lumen formation of the emerging tissues.image	[Ritzau-Reid, Kaja I.; Callens, Sebastien J.

However, the catalytic performance of pristine COFs is limited by the poor active sites and low electron transfer. Herein, to address these issues, the conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are coated by a defined structure RuBpy(H2O)(OH)Cl2 in bipyridine-based COF (TpBpy). And this composite with single site Ru incorporated can be used as HER electrocatalyst in alkaline conditions. A series of crucial issues are carefully discussed through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, such as the coordination structure of the atomically dispersion Ru ions, the catalytic mechanism of the embedded catalytic site, and the effect of COF and CNTs on the electrocatalytic properties. According to DFT calculations, the embedded single sites Ru act as catalytic sites for H2 generation. Benefitting from increasing the catalyst conductivity and the charge transfer, the as-prepared c-CNT-0.68@TpBpy-Ru shows an excellent HER overpotential of 112 mV at 10 mA cm-2 under alkaline conditions as well as an excellent durability up to 12 h, which is superior to that of most of the reported COFs electrocatalysts in alkaline solution.

The biological differences between CMSs are already present in CRC precursor lesions, but not all CMSs pose the same risk of malignant transformation. To fully understand the path to malignant transformation and to determine whether CMS is a fixed entity during progression, genomic and transcriptomic data from two regions of the same CRC lesion were compared: the precursor region and the carcinoma region. In total, 24 patients who underwent endoscopic removal of T1-2 CRC were included. Regions were subtyped for CMS and DNA mutation analysis was performed. Additionally, a set of 85 benign adenomas was CMS-subtyped. This analysis revealed that almost all benign adenomas were classified as CMS3 (91.8%). In contrast, CMS2 was the most prevalent subtype in precursor regions (66.7%), followed by CMS3 (29.2%). CMS4 was absent in precursor lesions and originated at the carcinoma stage. Importantly, CMS switching occurred in a substantial number of cases and almost all (six out of seven) CMS3 precursor regions showed a shift to a different subtype in the carcinoma part of the lesion, which in four cases was classified as CMS4. In conclusion, our data indicate that CMS3 is related to a more indolent type of precursor lesion that less likely progresses to CRC and when this occurs, it is often associated with a subtype change that includes the more aggressive mesenchymal CMS4. In contrast, an acquired CMS2 signature appeared to be rather fixed during early CRC development. Combined, our data show that subtype changes occur during progression and that CMS3 switching is related to changes in the genomic background through acquisition of a novel driver mutation (TP53) or selective expansion of a clone, but also occurred independently of such genetic changes. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

In particular, introducing chirality is a method to enhance compound performance. Herein, we report a multifunctional compound: (3APr)PbBr4 (1) (3APr=3-Pyrrolidinamine) and corresponding enantiomer R and S-(3APr)PbBr4 (R/S-2). Compound 1 show reversible solid-state phase transition, step-like dielectric anomaly and broadband yellow emission under uv light excitation. Accompany with phase transition, structure dimension transition from 2D to 1D without space group change. Through introduce chirality, the R/S-2 display mirror image 1D structural relationship, increased quantum yield from 3.43 % (1) to 13.65 % (R/S-2) and exhibits corresponding CD signals. Then combine to first-principles analysis, it was found that fluorescence is attributed to the formation of instantaneous defects during excitation, leading to the formation of self-trapped excitons (STEs). This finding will further promote the development of multifunctional compound and the study of chiral substitution enhance compound properties.

In this work, a thermal-favored Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped KGaGeO4 up-conversion phosphor with a negative thermal quenching behavior is explored. The as-developed phosphor performs a one-photon anti-Stokes emission and exhibits a remarkable enhancement for the rise of ambient temperature reaching 653 K. It is demonstrated that the fascinating thermal behavior of the up-conversion procedure is attributed to the enhanced energy transfer from the corresponding sensitizers to the activators by phonon assistance. Moreover, the microscopic dynamical process of phonon assistance and annihilation is revealed by introducing Er3+ ions as a probe. These results not only shed light on the phonon-assisted strategy to build a highly efficient anti-Stokes emission system but also open prospects for constructing phonon-favored transitions with nonthermally coupled emissions to realize luminescence thermometry for their distinct thermal responsivity. The participation of phonon energy during the anti-Stokes transition procedure endows lanthanide ions doped phosphors to exhibit fascinating negative thermal quenching. Here, a thermal-favorable Yb3+/Nd3+ co-doped KGaGeO4 up-conversion phosphor with drastically thermal-enhanced intensity is investigated in detail. This apparently anomalous phenomenon is demonstrated to be attributed to the enhanced energy transfer from the corresponding sensitizers to activators thanks to the effective phonon assistance. The results provide a strategy to construct phonon-favored transitions with nonthermally coupled emissions to realize effective luminescence thermometry.image	[Wang, Chao; Wang, Qingyuan; Yu, Xue] Chengdu Univ, Inst Adv Mat Deformat & Damage Multiscale, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu 610106, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Zhang, Hao; Cai, Yiyu; Xu, Xuhui] Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Adv Mat Yunnan Prov, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Zhang, Hao; Zhou, Bo] South China Univ Technol, State Key Lab Luminescent Mat & Devices, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Fiber Laser Mat & Appl Tech, Guangzhou 510641, Peoples R China	Chengdu University; Kunming University of Science & Technology; South China University of Technology	Yu, X (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ, Inst Adv Mat Deformat & Damage Multiscale, Sch Mech Engn, Chengdu 610106, Peoples R China.; Xu, XH (corresponding author), Kunming Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Key Lab Adv Mat Yunnan Prov, Kunming 650093, Peoples R China.	xuxuh07@126.com; yuyu6593@126.com			National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61965012]; Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation [202001AS070008]; Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation [2022JDJQ0030]; Yunnan Ten Thousand Talents Plan Young & Elite Talents Project [YNWR-QNBJ-2018-295]; Yunnan Major Scientific and Technological Projects [202202AG050004]; Excellent Youth Project of Yunnan Province Applied Basic Research Project [2019FI001]; Science and Technology Talents and Platform Program [202205AF150005]	National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province); Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation; Yunnan Ten Thousand Talents Plan Young & Elite Talents Project; Yunnan Major Scientific and Technological Projects; Excellent Youth Project of Yunnan Province Applied Basic Research Project; Science and Technology Talents and Platform Program	This work was financially supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (61965012), Yunnan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (202001AS070008), Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation (2022JDJQ0030), Yunnan Ten Thousand Talents Plan Young & Elite Talents Project (YNWR-QNBJ-2018-295), Yunnan Major Scientific and Technological Projects (202202AG050004), the Excellent Youth Project of Yunnan Province Applied Basic Research Project (2019FI001), and the Science and Technology Talents and Platform Program (202205AF150005).		48	0	0	5	5	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1863-8880	1863-8899		LASER PHOTONICS REV	Laser Photon.

However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene-metal-amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal-bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand-to-ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d-orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA-based OLEDs have been made. Here, a Concept article on CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed. This concept article on luminescent carbene-metal-amide (CMA) complexes is presented in terms of molecular design strategies, structure-property correlations and their applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The future directions and opportunities for advancing the development of CMA complexes and the related OLEDs are proposed as well.image	[Ying, Ao; Gong, Shaolong] Wuhan Univ, Dept Chem, Hubei Key Lab Organ & Polymer Optoelect Mat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China	Wuhan University	Gong, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Dept Chem, Hubei Key Lab Organ & Polymer Optoelect Mat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.	slgong@whu.edu.cn	Gong, Shaolong/C-6798-2016	Gong, Shaolong/0000-0002-1166-9047	Shaolong Gong gratefully acknowledges financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52022071 and 51873158).

The coordination of barrier performance and self-healing ability, however, continues to be difficult. Herein, a polymer coating based on polyethyleneimine (PEI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) with self-repairing and barrier ability was designed. Introducing the catechol group into the anti-corrosion coating increases the adhesion and self-healing efficiency of the coating, providing a guarantee for the long-term stable bonding between the anti-corrosion coating and the metal substrate. Small molecular weight PAA polymers are added to polymer coatings to increase their self-healing capabilities and corrosion resistance. Because layer-by-layer assembly creates reversible hydrogen bonds and electrostatic bonds that help the coating repair itself when it is damaged, and because the traction of small molecular weight polyacrylic acid speeds up this process. When polyacrylic acid (PAA) with a molecular weight of 2000 was present in the coating at a concentration of 1.5 mg/mL, the coating's self-healing capability and corrosion resistance were at their peak. The PEI-C/PAA45W-PAA2000 coating completed the self-healing within 10 min, and the corrosion resistance efficiency (Pe) was as high as 90.1 %. The polarization resistance (Rp) was maintained at 7.67x104 & omega; cm2 after immersion for more than 240 h. It was better than other samples in this work. The polymer provides a new idea for the prevention of metal corrosion.

Management of bleeding during dental implant surgery using a novel implant with an abbreviated drilling protocol: A clinical report	JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS-IMPLANT ESTHETIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE DENTISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						dental implants; N1 implant; novel design; one drill; single drill; site preparation		Coagulopathy is a well-recognized complication in dental surgery in patients who use oral anticoagulants or some dietary supplements. Proper pre-operative diagnosis, medical consultation, timely management, and conservative treatment can decrease the incidence of such complications. Management of bleeding during dental implant surgery commonly involves conventional methods such as discontinuation of anticoagulant use, compression, styptics, and local anesthetic administration containing vasoconstrictors. This clinical report describes the successful management of a patient with a history of coagulopathy who was rehabilitated with complete arch fixed implant-supported prostheses with immediate loading. A novel implant design with a significantly abbreviated single drill protocol for osteotomy preparation was used in an outpatient setting.

Synergistic effect of single wall carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide hybrid nano-filler on thermal stabilization and tensile strength of polyacrylonitrile copolymer	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article; Early Access						carbon nanotube; graphene oxide; hybrid nano-filler; polyacrylonitrile; thermal stabilization	GRAPHENE OXIDE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; NANOCOMPOSITES; CARBONIZATION; COMPOSITES; FIBER	This study reports how hybrid nano-filler can enhance the tensile strength, electrical properties and thermal stabilization of PAN (polyacrylonitrile) nanocomposite films. The nano-fillers used are graphene oxide (GO), single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), and a hybrid of both. The combination of both nano-fillers was made by dispersing GO in DMAc (dimethyl acetamide) and then adding SWCNT to the solution. The solution was mixed well using ultrasonication and high-speed stirring. 1 wt% amount of nano-filler solutions was added to PAN liquid to make PAN nanocomposite films. The films were tested for mechanical properties, electrical resistivity, thermoxidative stabilization, and thermal stability. The results showed that adding nano-fillers to PAN significantly improved its tensile strength. GO increased the tensile strength by 42.9% (38.3 MPa), while SWCNT increased it by 57.3% (42.15 MPa). The combination of both (0.5 wt% SWCNT + 0.5 wt% GO) had a remarkable effect, increasing the tensile strength by 96% (52.53 MPa). This was because the combination of both prevented SWCNT from agglomerating together and made it interact better with the PAN, forming a complete network. The combination of both also made the PAN oxidize and stabilize early and efficiently during heating, which made its residual weight increase by similar to 5.5% more than pristine PAN in TGA. The electrical resistivity and SEM micrograph data correlate with the thermal analysis data, showing that PCG (1 wt% combination) reached the percolation threshold because of the benefits of both GO and SWCNT. The combination of both also showed 95.6% synergy in tensile strength compared to individual nano-fillers, indicating its potential for efficient reinforcement.

We calculated the kappa statistic to determine the nurse and physician correlation for each component of the modified Downes' score and total score on admission and evaluated the concordance of scores above and below the treatment threshold of 4.Results Of the 1151 eligible infants admitted, 817 infants (71%) had scores reported concurrently and independently by nurse and physician. The kappa statistic for modified Downes' score components ranged from 0.88 to 0.92 and was 0.89 for the total score. There was 98% concordance for score-based treatment.Conclusion Incorporation of the modified Downes' score on admission for preterm infants with respiratory distress was feasible in tertiary NICUs in Ethiopia. The kappa statistics showed near-perfect agreement between nurse and physician assessments, translating to a very high degree of concordance in score-based treatment recommendations. These results highlight an opportunity for task-shifting assessments and empowering nurses.	[Ehret, Danielle E.

Finally, ICD-driven immune responses can only operate and exert cytotoxic effector functions if the microenvironment of target cancer cells enables immune cell infiltration and activity. Multiple forms of radiation, including non-ionizing (ultraviolet) and ionizing radiation, elicit bona fide ICD as they increase both the antigenicity and adjuvanticity of dying cancer cells. Here, we review the molecular determinants of ICD as elicited by radiation as we critically discuss strategies to reinforce the immunogenicity of cancer cells succumbing to clinically available radiation strategies.

A number of carbonous fillers including carbon black, carbon fiber, carbon nanotube, graphite and its derivatives, and fullerene can be loaded into the PU matrixes to impart electrical conductivity. The properties of the carbonous fillers, the filler/PU interactions, and the method of compositing determine the conductive performance of the composite. It is possible to modulate the properties of the conductive PU composites and employ them for a number of electronic applications including but not limited to the strain sensors, electromagnetic interference shielding materials, supercapacitors, and tissue engineering scaffolds. In the present review, first, the distinctive properties of PU as a matrix of conductive composites have been discussed. Then, various carbon fillers loaded into the PU matrixes and their structural and conductive properties have been debated. Thereafter, the fabrication methods of the conductive composites as well as the influential parameters on the electrical properties of the composites have been reviewed to provide an insight into how fulfill a PU composite with the desired electrical performance.

Optimization of 3D dynamic speech MRI: Poisson-disc undersampling and locally higher-rank reconstruction through partial separability model with regional optimized temporal basis	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						dynamic MRI; linguistics; low rank reconstruction; speech MRI	NASALIZATION; ARTICULATION	Purpose To improve the spatiotemporal qualities of images and dynamics of speech MRI through an improved data sampling and image reconstruction approach.Methods For data acquisition, we used a Poisson-disc random under sampling scheme that reduced the undersampling coherence. For image reconstruction, we proposed a novel locally higher-rank partial separability model. This reconstruction model represented the oral and static regions using separate low-rank subspaces, therefore, preserving their distinct temporal signal characteristics. Regional optimized temporal basis was determined from the regional-optimized virtual coil approach. Overall, we achieved a better spatiotemporal image reconstruction quality with the potential of reducing total acquisition time by 50%.Results The proposed method was demonstrated through several 2-mm isotropic, 64 mm total thickness, dynamic acquisitions with 40 frames per second and compared to the previous approach using a global subspace model along with other k-space sampling patterns. Individual timeframe images and temporal profiles of speech samples were shown to illustrate the ability of the Poisson-disc under sampling pattern in reducing total acquisition time. Temporal information of sagittal and coronal directions was also shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the locally higher-rank operator and regional optimized temporal basis. To compare the reconstruction qualities of different regions, voxel-wise temporal SNR analysis were performed.Conclusion Poisson-disc sampling combined with a locally higher-rank model and a regional-optimized temporal basis can drastically improve the spatiotemporal image quality and provide a 50% reduction in overall acquisition time.

Nutritionists have recommended an increased consumption of dietary fiber in the daily diet to improve health. Within this context, this work aims to formulate "spaghetti" pasta enriched with lupin flour and wheat bran. For the formulation of the mixture of those flours, we used the NemrodW software to predict the optimal pasta formula. A physicochemical characterization, as well as the culinary quality of the pasta resulting from the different mixtures, was carried out to model each significant criterion and choose the optimal mixture that will be used in the pasta recipe. The evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the pasta showed that the addition of lupin flour and bran resulted in an improvement in the nutritional value of the enriched spaghetti. Following the results obtained, the software proposed an optimal mix and will be used for further study. This formula comprises 19.60% bran, 27.83% lupin flour, and 52.75% durum wheat semolina. The caloric value of the dough from the optimal mix was determined and compared to that of the standard dough. The results of our study indicated a significant improvement in the nutritional value of the enriched pasta compared to the standard pasta. The enriched pasta contained higher levels of protein, ash, lipids, polyphenols, and pigments and lower levels of sugars, which make it a more nutritious option for certain individuals, such as athletes or those following a protein or low-sugar diet.Practical ApplicationThe proposed method of substituting wheat semolina with lupine flour and wheat bran in spaghetti formulation has demonstrated a potential for producing protein-rich and nutritionally enriched pasta. This approach can be useful for developing similar functional food products that cater to the dietary requirements of athletes or individuals following a protein or low-sugar diet.

Functional traits are used to find the broad spectrum of resource use strategies that plants use to respond to environmental variation. The patterns and drivers of plant community assembly through the lens of traits and phylogeny; however, remain to be studied in a uniquely biodiversity rich but poorly known fragmented dry Afromontane forest of Ethiopia. Here, we combined trait and community phylogenetic data from thirty sampling plots of 20 x 20 m size to determine the functional and phylogenetic structures and their drivers in a fragmented, human-dominated dry evergreen Afromontane forest. We found phylogenetic and functional clustering of plants in which the effect of environment was found to be trait specific. A weak phylogenetic signal for traits was detected suggesting that species resource use strategies may not be inferred using species phylogenetic distance. Additionally, we found functional traits to be weak in predicting species abundance distribution. Overall, while this study shows a non-random community assembly pattern, it also highlights the importance of deterministic processes being trait specific.Abstract in Amharic is available with online material. ብዝሃ-ህይወት የሚጠብቁትን መሰረታዊ ስልቶች ለመረዳት፣ የአካባቢ ሁኔታዎች በእጽዋት ስርጭት ላይ እንዴት ተጽዕኖ እንደሚያሳድሩ ማጥናት አስፈላጊ ነው። ዘርፈ-ብዙ የሆነውን የእጽዋትንና አካባቢን መስተጋብር ለመረዳት የእጽዋቶች ባህሪያት (functional traits) ይጠቅማሉ:: በተራቆተው ነገር ግን በብዝሃ-ሂዎቱ በሚታወቀው በሰሜኑ የአትዮጵያ ክፍል የሚገኘው ደን የእጽዋት ስርጭትና ስርጭቱን የሚቆጣጠሩ ደንቢውች አልተጠኑም:: በዚህ ክፉኛ በተራቆተ አካባቢ ውስጥ በሚገኘው ደን እያንዳንዳቸው 20 x 20 ሜትር መጠን ባላቸው ሠላሳ የናሙና ቦታዎች በመውሰድ የደኑን ባህሪያት (functional traits) እና ዝምድና (phylogenetic relationships) መረጃ በመሰብሰብ, የ&#x12 a5;ጽዋቶችን የቦታ አመራረጥና የደንቢወችን ተፅዕኖ አጥንተናል:: በጥናቱም የእጽዋቶችን ባህሪያት (functional traits) እና ዝምድና (phylogeny) ስርጭት በዘፈቀደ ሳይሆን ስልታዊ በሆነ ተመሳሳይ ፍላጎት ባላቸው እጽዋቶች መሰባሰብ ነው(clustering):: ነገር ግን የአካባቢው አፈር ተፅዕኖ በሁሉም የእጽዋት ባህሪያት (functional traits) ሳይሆን በተወሰኑ ብቻ ነው:: በተጨማሪም የእጽዋቶች አመጋገብ ስርዓት (resource use strategies) በመካከላቸው ባለው ዝምድና አይወሰንም:: ሩቅ ዝምድና ያላቸው እጽዋቶች ተመሳሳይ የአመጋገብ ፍላጎትና ስልት ሊኖራቸው ይችላል::ከዚህም በተጨማሪ የእጽዋቶች ባህሪያት (functional traits) የእጽዋቶችን የብዛት ስርጭት (Species abundance distribution) የመወሰን አቅማችው ደካማ ሆኖ ተገኝ&#x127 7;ል::ባጠቃላይ ይህ ጥናት እጽዋቶች በዘፈቀደ ሳይሆን የተሰራጩት (random distribution)፣ የኣካባቢውን ሃብት (resource) መሰረት አድርገው መሆኑን አሳይቷል:: በተጨማሪም የአካባቢው ደንቢ ሁሉንም ባህሪያት(functional traits) እኩል ተፅዕኖ አላደረገም፣ ይልቁንም ባህሪያትን (traits) መሰረት ያደረገ ነው:: While trait and phylogenetic convergence of plant communities with trait-specific response to environmental factors was detected, traits were found to be weak in predicting species abundance distribution in a fragmented forest.image	[Kassaw, Eshete; Masresha, Getinet; Asefa, Mengesha] Univ Gondar, Coll Nat & Computat Sci, Dept Biol, Gondar 196, Ethiopia; [Asefa, Mengesha] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla, Peoples R China	University of Gondar; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS	Asefa, M (corresponding author), Univ Gondar, Coll Nat & Computat Sci, Dept Biol, Gondar 196, Ethiopia.	asefa_men@yahoo.com			We would like to thank the University of Gondar for its financial support.

Schisandra chinensis Baillon (omija) is an herbal plant with various functional health activities. Previous VOC analyses focused on S. chinensis fruit but not its leaves. Therefore, VOCs in S. chinensis fruit and leaves were analyzed using headspace stir-bar sorptive extraction (HS-SBSE)-GC-MS, and optimal conditions were established. Various factors, such as the sample preparation method, twister stir-bar type, sample amount, extraction temperature, and extraction time, expected to affect extraction were carefully optimized. Under the optimal conditions, 35 and 40 VOCs were identified in S. chinensis fruit and leaves, respectively. This HS-SBSE method is capable of rapid analysis and a low contamination rate without requiring organic solvents. These findings provide practical guidelines for HS-SBSE applications in various food matrices by providing analytical methods for VOC detection.

Previous studies in mice reported that the retinoic acid (RA) contributed to cleft palate in high incidence by delaying the elevating procedure, but little was known about the underlying biological mechanisms. Methods: In this study, hematoxylin-eosin and immunofluorescence staining were employed to evaluate the phenotypes and the expression of related markers in the RA-treated mice model. In situ hybridization and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of genes involved in Wnt signaling pathway. The palatal mesenchymal cells were cultured in vitro, and stimulated with RA or CASIN, and co-treated with Foxy5. Wnt5a and Ccd42 expression were evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. Phalloidin was used to label the microfilament cytoskeleton (F-actin) in cultured cells. Results: We revealed that RA resulted in 100% incidence of cleft palate in mouse embryos, and the expression of genes responsible for Wnt5a-mediated noncanonical Wnt signal transduction were specifically downregulated in mesenchymal palatal shelves. The in vitro study of palatal mesenchymal cells indicated that RA treatment disrupted the organized remodeling of cytoskeleton, an indicative structure of cell migration regulated by the small Rho GTPase Cdc42. Moreover, we showed that the suppression of cytoskeleton and cell migration induced by RA was partially restored using the small molecule Foxy-5-mediated activation of Wnt5A, and this restoration was attenuated by CASIN (a selective GTPase Cdc42 inhibitor) again. Conclusions: These data identified a crucial mechanism for Wnt5a-mediated noncanonical Wnt signaling in acting downstream of Rho GTPase Cdc42 to regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration during the process of palate elevation. Our study provided a new explanation for the cause of cleft palate induced by RA.

The competence of Third Harmonic Generation (THG) includes the label free imaging with diffraction-limited resolution and three-dimensional visualization with negligible phototoxicity effects. In this study, THG records and quantifies the lipid content of Drosophila haemocytes, upon encountering normal or tumorigenic neural cells, in correlation with their shape or their state. We show that the lipid accumulations of adult haemocytes are similar before and after encountering normal cells. In contrast, adult haemocytes prior to their interaction with cancer cells have a low lipid index, which increases while they are actively engaged in phagocytosis only to decrease again when haemocytes become exhausted. This dynamic change in the lipid accrual of haemocytes upon encountering tumour cells could potentially be a useful tool to assess the phagocytic capacity or activation state of tumour-associated haemocytes.

Several previous studies suggested that some of the functions of the IL-23/IL-22 axis on intestinal epithelial cells are shared between the small and large intestines. However, the similarities and differences of the IL-23/IL-22 axis on epithelial cells between these two anatomical sites remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the gene expression of intestinal epithelial cells in the ileum and colon of germ-free, Il23(-/-), and Il22(-/-) mice by RNA-sequencing. We found that while the IL-23/IL-22 axis is largely dependent on gut microbiota in the small intestine, it is much less dependent on it in the large intestine. In addition, the negative regulation of lipid metabolism in the epithelial cells by IL-23 and IL-22 in the small intestine was revealed, whereas the positive regulation of epithelial cell proliferation by IL-23 and IL-22 in the large intestine was highlighted. These findings shed light on the intestinal site-specific role of the IL-23/IL-22 axis in maintaining the physiological functions of intestinal epithelial cells.

Each of the seaweed ethanolic extracts solution (2%, w/v) was used for dipping the fish fillets for 10 min at 4 degrees C. The control and seaweed extract-treated fillets were stored at 4 +/- 1 degrees C in air-tight polyethylene bags, and chemical, bacteriological, and sensory evaluation were performed at every 4 days' intervals. During the storage period, P. tetrastromatica extract significantly (p <.05) reduced the increment of pH, peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and total volatile basic nitrogen values in Nile tilapia fillets compared to other seaweed extracts-treated and untreated fillets. The maximal total viable count of control, P. tetrastromatica, S. natans, and S. fluitans extracts-treated fillets was 6.53, 7.11, 6.75, and 7.10 log CFU/g at the 8th, 20th, 12th, and 16th days of storage, respectively. The total psychrotrophic count of control and seaweed extracts-treated fillets was also significantly increased (p <.05) throughout the storage period. The P. tetrastromatica extracts-treated fillets showed better sensory characteristics than other seaweed extracts-treated and control fillets. Results of this study suggest that ethanolic extracts (2%, w/v) of P. tetrastromatica extend the shelf life for 12 days longer than the control fillets in refrigerated conditions.

However, myocardial perfusion can be affected by factors other than coronary stenosis. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent sex, age, diabetes, hypertension and smoking affect quantitative myocardial perfusion, beyond the degree of coronary artery stenosis, in patients with suspected or established CCS. Eighty-six patients [median age 69 (range 46-86) years, 24 females] planned for elective coronary angiography due to suspected or established CCS were included. All patients underwent cardiac N-13-NH3 positron emission tomography to quantify myocardial perfusion at rest and stress. Lowest myocardial perfusion (perfusion(min)) at stress and rest and lowest myocardial perfusion reserve (MPRmin) for all vessel territories was used as dependent variables in a linear mixed model. Independent variables were vessel territory, degree of coronary artery stenosis (as a continuous variable of 0%-100% stenosis), sex, age, diabetes, hypertension and smoking habits. Degree of coronary artery stenosis (p < 0.001), male sex (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.6 mL/min/g, p < 0.001), increasing age (p = 0.025), diabetes (1.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.6 mL/min/g, p = 0.023) and smoking (1.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.6 mL/min/g, p = 0.052) were independently associated with myocardial perfusionmin at stress. Degree of coronary artery stenosis (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.040), diabetes (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.7, p = 0.046) and hypertension (2.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.6, p = 0.033) were independently associated with MPRmin. Sex, increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and smoking affect myocardial perfusion independent of coronary artery stenosis in patients with suspected or established CCS. Thus, these factors need to be considered when assessing the significance of reduced quantitative myocardial perfusion of patients with suspected or established CCS.

However, most of the existing control charts for monitoring count data are parametric. Parametric control charts can be problematic when the underlying parametric distributional assumption does not hold for the particular application. On the other hand, nonparametric control charts do not require such distributional assumptions, and are more desirable in real-world situations where the underlying distribution cannot be easily described using a parametric distribution. In this paper, we extend the nonparametric control chart for continuous data monitoring proposed by Li to count data monitoring. To guarantee a desired in-control performance, we further adopt the bootstrap procedure proposed by Gandy and Kvaloy to help determine the control limit of our proposed control chart. Our simulation studies and real data analysis show that the proposed control chart performs well across a variety of settings, and compares favorably with other existing nonparametric control charts for count data.

Unsupervised deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms have recently been deeply concerned owing to scarce fabric defect samples, high annotation cost, and deficient prior knowledge. Most unsupervised reconstruction models are prone to overfitting and poor generalisation performance, resulting in blurred images, residual defects, and uneven textures in the reconstruction results. On this account, an unsupervised fabric surface defect detection method using the Progressive Mask Repair Model (PMRM) has been developed. Specifically, PMRM with transformer architecture gathers detailed feature information. In order to pay closer attention to the textural properties of fabrics, the model incorporates structural similarity as a constraint in the training stage. In the detection stage, we designate the non-defective area of the fabric image as the background and the defective area as the foreground. Next, a progressive mask is applied to repair the background of the defective area, which avoids defect false detection resulting from the poor reconstruction effect of the traditional reconstruction model in the non-defective area. Finally, image processing methods such as image difference, frequency-tuned salient detection, and threshold binarisation are used to segment the defects. Relative to the other six unsupervised defect detection methods, the proposed scheme increases the F1 score and intersection over union (IoU) by at least 9.34% and 8.49%, respectively. According to the earlier results, PMRM is effective and exhibits superiority.

The most effective way to decide the optimum operational conditions, e.g. aeration on/off time or DO concentration during the aeration period, is to determine specific nitrification/denitrification rates. For this purpose, the effects of DO (6 and 3 mg L-1) and aeration on/off time (from 2/2 to 90/360 min) on the specific ammonium oxidation and denitritation/denitrification rates in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating real textile wastewater were deeply investigated. RESULTS: The highest specific ammonium oxidation, denitritation and denitrification rates were obtained as 5.4, 3.8, and 5.3 mg N g(-1) volatile suspended solids h(-1), respectively, at an aeration on/off time of 90/360 min, which corresponded to the increase in specific ammonium oxidation rates by 1.8 and 2.1 times compared to continuous aeration conditions where DO was 6 and 3 mg L-1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Higher specific ammonium oxidation and denitrification rates can be achieved with the intermittent aeration compared to continuous aeration. Hence existing treatment plants can be retrofitted for higher performance with reduced energy requirements. (C) 2023 The Authors.

Methods: A novel, quantitative online survey was distributed to aged care dietitians. Activities, knowledge, and skills areas outlined by the Dietitians Australia 'Older Persons and Aged Care Dietitian Role Statement' were included in the 23-item survey. Likert scales captured participant responses. Median responses (n, %) are presented. Associations between participants' confidence in their knowledge and skills and years of experience working in aged care were explored using Pearson's chi-squared tests. Results: Dietitians completed the survey (N = 125; age: 40 +/- 13 years [mean +/- SD]; 97.6% female). Dietitians reported they "always" worked collaboratively (n = 65%, 52%) and 'often' prescribed supplements (n = 52%, 41.6%) and utilised a food-first approach (n = 36%, 28.8%). Dietitians 'sometimes' conducted malnutrition screening (n = 28%, 22.4%), audits (n = 36%, 28.8%), nutrition education (n = 53%, 42.4%) and quality improvement activities (n = 28%, 22.4%). Dietitians 'rarely' utilised food service/standards (n = 38%, 30.4%) and nutrition/hydration procedures (n = 35%, 28.0%). Dietitians with =6 years of experience were more confident than dietitians with 0-5 years in providing support programs (p = 0.003), utilising healthcare policies (p = 0.013), interpreting quality assessment (p = 0.014) and communication skills (p = 0.047). Dietitians felt 'completely' or 'fairly' confident in all knowledge and skill areas, except for government and community support programs (n = 38%, 30.4%) rated 'somewhat' confident. Conclusion: Aged care dietitians are confident in most aspects of their role but have opportunities to be better supported. Developing the confidence of higher-level systems and communication in early career dietitians is warranted.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with no proper treatment at present is characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of a cultured T cell fraction comprising adiponectin-expressing Tregs, referred to as A-TregTF (adiponectin-expressing Treg-containing T cell fraction), in inhibiting the progression of TNBC in vivo.MethodsThe efficacy of a spontaneously expanding T cell fraction comprising adiponectin-expressing Treg in inhibiting tumor growth was analyzed in a murine orthotopic 4 T1-Luc TNBC model.ResultsThe treatment with T cell fraction containing adiponectin-expressing Tregs significantly inhibited the growth and metastasis of orthotopically transplanted 4 T1-Luc tumor cells. Histopathological examination further revealed that the adiponectin-expressing Tregs infiltrated the tumor tissue via a cell-in-cell mechanism and were found to be specifically localized around the necrotic areas.ConclusionsBased on our findings, the T cell fraction comprising adiponectin-expressing Tregs, represents a potential candidate for adoptive cell therapy against TNBC.

In this technology, an electrocatalytic material and renewable energy-generated electricity drive the conversion of carbon dioxide into high-value chemicals and carbon-neutral fuels. Over the past few years, single-atom catalysts have been intensively studied as they could provide near-unity atom utilization and unique catalytic performance. Single-atom catalysts have become one of the state-of-the-art catalyst materials for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide. However, it remains a challenge for single-atom catalysts to facilitate the efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into products beyond carbon monoxide. In this review, we summarize and present important findings and critical insights from studies on the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction into hydrocarbons and oxygenates using single-atom catalysts. It is hoped that this review gives a thorough recapitulation and analysis of the science behind the catalysis of carbon dioxide into more reduced products through single-atom catalysts so that it can be a guide for future research and development on catalysts with industry-ready performance for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into high-value chemicals and carbon-neutral fuels.

Cell-penetrating peptides predictors: A comparative analysis of methods and datasets	MOLECULAR INFORMATICS			English	Article; Early Access						cell-penetrating peptides; datasets; machine learning; peptide sequence similarity	PROTEIN	Cell-Penetrating Peptides (CPP) are emerging as an alternative to small-molecule drugs to expand the range of biomolecules that can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Due to the importance of identifying and designing new CPP, a great variety of predictors have been developed to achieve these goals. To establish a ranking for these predictors, a couple of recent studies compared their performances on specific datasets, yet their conclusions cannot determine if the ranking obtained is due to the model, the set of descriptors or the datasets used to test the predictors. We present a systematic study of the influence of the peptide sequence's similarity of the datasets on the predictors' performance. The analysis reveals that the datasets used for training have a stronger influence on the predictors performance than the model or descriptors employed. We show that datasets with low sequence similarity between the positive and negative examples can be easily separated, and the tested classifiers showed good performance on them. On the other hand, a dataset with high sequence similarity between CPP and non-CPP will be a hard dataset, and it should be the one to be used for assessing the performance of new predictors. image	[Guerrero-Vazquez, Karen; Brizuela, Carlos A.] CICESE Res Ctr, Dept Comp Sci, Ensenada 22860, Mexico; [Guerrero-Vazquez, Karen] Univ Galway, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Galway, Ireland; [Del Rio, Gabriel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular, Dept Biochem & Struct Biol, Mexico City 04510, Mexico; [Brizuela, Carlos A.] CICESE Res Ctr, Dept Comp Sci, Ensenada 22860, Mexico; [Del Rio, Gabriel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular, Dept Biochem & Struct Biol, Mexico City 04510, Mexico	CICESE - Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CICESE - Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico	Brizuela, CA (corresponding author), CICESE Res Ctr, Dept Comp Sci, Ensenada 22860, Mexico.; Del Rio, G (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Fisiol Celular, Dept Biochem & Struct Biol, Mexico City 04510, Mexico.	gdelrio@ifc.unam.mx; cbrizuel@cicese.edu.mx	Brizuela, Carlos/JFA-3640-2023	Brizuela, Carlos/0000-0003-4621-0380	To Dr. Maria Teresa Lara Ortiz for her technical assistance in the development of this work.

Insecticides primarily control this pest while alternative controls are in development. Laboratory studies show that erythritol is insecticidal to D. suzukii and other pests while approved for human consumption. Moreover, erythritol combined with sucrose or noncaloric sucralose can stimulate feeding and quicken mortality. Before growers can use erythritol, the impact on crop protection, non-target insects, and fruit quality need evaluation. RESULTS: In three blueberry and cherry field cage trials, oviposition on fruit sprayed with erythritol:sucrose or erythritol:sucralose formulations was lowered by 59%-81% compared with unsprayed controls. Fly infestation (larval or adult counts from fruit) was 90% lower in a greenhouse blueberry trial, and 49% lower in an open field blueberry trial with 2 M erythritol : 0.5 M sucrose. Infestation was also 57% lower in an open field cherry trial with 1.5 M erythritol:0.5 M sucrose. Other field trials with very low pest pressure or frequent rains revealed no differences from controls. Field trials consistently revealed that honey bees did not preferentially visit plants sprayed with either erythritol formulation, although yellow jackets visited plants sprayed with erythritol:sucrose more frequently. Erythritol formulations consistently led to more leaf spotting, but there was no reduction in the quality of treated blueberries or cherries in terms of mold development, firmness, diameter, epidermal penetration force, and Brix degrees (total soluble solids) at harvest. CONCLUSION: Eleven trials conducted over four years show that erythritol formulations can reduce D. suzukii pressure without attracting foraging honey bees nor negatively impacting fruit quality.

We retrospectively investigated the serum interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 kDa (IP- 10) level as a predictive indicator of regression of liver fibrosis after successful hepatitis C virus eradication by direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) therapy. Methods: The study participants were recruited from a historical cohort of 116 chronically hepatitis C virus-infected patients who had achieved sustained virological response by DAAs therapy and whose serum Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) levels at baseline (before DAAs therapy) were =2.0 cut-off index. We defined patients with M2BPGi levels <1.76 and =1.76 cut-off index at 2 years after the end of treatment (EOT) as the regression (n = 71) and non-regression (n = 45) groups, respectively. Results: Multivariate analyses revealed that the albumin-bilirubin score at baseline, and albumin-bilirubin score, Fibrosis-4 index at 24 weeks after the EOT, and serum IP-10 change from baseline to 24 weeks after the EOT (IP-10 change) were significantly associated with regression of M2BPGi-based liver fibrosis. In addition, IP-10 change was significantly associated with regression of M2BPGi-based liver fibrosis by a multivariate analysis, even when the serum M2BPGi levels were aligned by propensity score matching and in patients with advanced M2BPGi-based liver fibrosis: M2BPGi levels >= 3.3 cut-off index at baseline. Conclusions: Serum IP-10 change from baseline to 24 weeks after the EOT is a feasible predictor of regression of M2BPGi-based liver fibrosis after achieving sustained virological response with DAA therapy.

The model's parameters are calibrated for each bank in the Operational Riskdata eXchange (ORX) consortium, based only on publicly available exposure indicators. The model generates simulated internal operational losses, exhibiting standard stochastic properties and tail behavior that closely align with actual operational losses.

Moreover, we identify macro-environmental factors that exert influence over the severity and frequency of model-simulated losses, consistent with findings in the existing literature.

In recent decades, the medical utility of MSCs has been evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, providing a foundation for therapeutic applications. However, the existing limitations of MSC therapy indicate the necessity for novel therapies. Notably, small extracellular vesicles (sEV) derived from MSCs have emerged rapidly as candidates instead of their parental cells. The acquisition of abundant and scalable MSC-sEV is an obstacle for clinical applications. The potential application of MSC-sEV in allergic diseases has attracted increasing attention from researchers. By carrying biological microRNAs or active proteins, MSC-sEV can modulate the function of various innate and adaptive immune cells. In this review, we summarise the recent advances in the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs in allergic diseases, the cellular sources of MSC-sEV, and the methods for obtaining high-quality human MSC-sEV. In addition, we discuss the immunoregulatory capacity of MSCs and MSC-sEV for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis, with a special emphasis on their immunoregulatory effects and the underlying mechanisms of immune cell modulation. Mesenchymal stromal cells-derived small extracellular vesicle modulate the function of both innate and adaptive immunocytes via encapsulated nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and other small molecules in small extracellular vesicle. Subsequently, the inflammatory cascade could be raised, such as inflammatory cytokines secretion, immune cell migration, expansion, polarization, and degranulation, which play a role in modulating the allergic response.image	[Peng, Ya-Qi; Deng, Xiao-Hui; Xu, Zhi-Bin; Wu, Zi-Cong; Fu, Qing-Ling] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Otorhinolaryngol Hosp, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Peng, Ya-Qi] Southern Med Univ, Guangdong Prov Peoples Hosp, Guangdong Acad Med Sci, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiao-Hui; Fu, Qing-Ling] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Lab Stem Cells & Tissue Engn, Minist Educ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China	Sun Yat Sen University; Southern Medical University - China; Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences & Guangdong General Hospital; Sun Yat Sen University	Fu, QL (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Otorhinolaryngol Hosp, Affiliated Hosp 1, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.; Fu, QL (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Key Lab Stem Cells & Tissue Engn, Minist Educ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.	fuqingl@mail.sysu.edu.cn		Deng, xiaohui/0000-0003-0030-439X; Fu, Qing-Ling/0000-0002-5969-628X					153	0	0	2	2	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0014-2980	1521-4141		EUR J IMMUNOL	Eur.

However, only a few mitogenomes from the Thienemanniella genus have been reported till now. Furthermore, there is still indeterminacy in the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Thienemanniella. In this study, mitogenomes of five Thienemanniella species were sequenced and analyzed newly. Combined with the published mitogenome of Thienemanniella nipponica, the obtained results showed that mitogenomes of Thienemanniella were conserved in structure, and all genes were observed to be arranged in the same gene order as the ancestral mitogenome. Nucleotide composition varied significantly among different genes, and the control region displayed the highest A + T content. All protein coding genes are subjected to purification selection, and the fastest evolving gene is ATP8. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses showed the phylogeny of Thienemanniella which was supported in five topologies. Our present study provides valuable insight into the phylogenetic relationships of Thienemanniella species.

A taxonomy for molecular classification exists, but it is unknown if molecular subtypes show tropism for different organs. Here, we study 146 patients with de novo metastatic disease or recurrence after curative treatment. We classify primary tumors using two transcriptomic methods and immunostaining and identify enrichment and depletion of metastatic sites in molecular subtypes using permutation tests. We observed significant depletion of bone metastases in the Basal/squamous molecular subtype, whereas the Urothelial-like subtype entailed an enrichment for metastases to bone. The Genomically unstable subtype was depleted of lung metastases, but enriched for atypical sites, including six out of seven patients with brain metastases. Stroma-rich primary tumor samples were associated with local recurrence, but not with distant sites. Additionally, the proportion with brain or testis metastases differed between systemic chemotherapy regimens (GC vs MVAC) suggesting a sanctuary effect. In conclusion, molecular subtypes of urothelial bladder cancer are significantly associated with specific metastatic sites, suggesting that subtype-specific molecular determinants could exist at various steps in the metastatic cascade.

Eye-tracking devices provide opportunities to monitor the acquisition of surgical skills, gain insight into performance, and enhance surgical practice. The aim of this review was to consolidate the available evidence for the use of eye-tracking in the surgical disciplines. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search of OVID Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Scopus, and Science Direct was conducted January 2000 until December 2022. Studies involving eye-tracking in surgical training, assessment and technical innovation were included in the review. Non-surgical procedures, animal studies, and studies not involving surgical participants were excluded from the review. Results: The search returned a total of 12 054 articles, 80 of which were included in the final analysis and review. Seventeen studies involved eye-tracking in surgical training, 48 surgical assessment, and 20 were focussing on technical aspects of this technology. Twenty-six different eye-tracking devices were used in the included studies. Metrics such as the number of fixations, duration of fixations, dwell time, and cognitive workload were able to differentiate between novice and expert performance. Eight studies demonstrated the effectiveness of gaze-training for improving surgical skill. Conclusion: The current literature shows a broad range of utility for a variety of eye-tracking devices in surgery. There remains a lack of standardization for metric parameters and gaze analysis techniques. Further research is required to validate its use to establish reliability and create uniform practices.

If architecture frameworks (AF) such as NATO (NAF) were designed to fill this common need, their current state is essentially descriptive. As it turns out, building defense systems architectures using those frameworks in a properly anticipated cost/delay budget envelope would require to have all system engineering already solved, because the architecture frameworks are designed to provide an explicit representation of the operational domain that can be used in analysis, for articulation of issues and requirements, as support to planning, and as a means of solution design and validation, among other things. Thus Quality-Resource-Time <Q,R,T> optimality in a regularly evolving environment cannot be represented in acceptable delay without automated optimization assistance. Our contribution in this article explores coupling architecture framework with operation research (OR) models to enable computer assisted design and evaluation of heterogeneous views in NATO Architecture Framework (NAF). Our illustrative example is a Linear Programming based bridge between program management and system engineering to anticipate <Q,R,T> optimal trade-offs. This article presents promising results, with which we hope to show how OR and AF will be indivisible in architecture evaluation process.

Results revealed 11 different compounds with the highest concentrations of 44.79% 3-propenal 3-phenyl, 34.98% trans-cinnamaldehyde, and 10.18% 4-propenal 3-phenyl in CEO. pH and total soluble solids of the apple juice samples significantly decreased; whereas total phenolic substance content of the samples significantly increased by added CEO. The same process parameters caused 3.26 & PLUSMN; 0.19 and 3.83 & PLUSMN; 0.16 log reductions on TAMB and TMY, revealing no detectable numbers after PEF treatment. Similarly, maximum 5.13 and 3.87 log reductions on Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes were obtained on 0.06 & mu;L mL-1 CEO added samples treated after 604 & mu;s. Moreover, increased CEO concentration, when treatment time was constant, caused significantly more microbial inactivation. Increase in treatment time resulted in an incline on & UDelta;H of the samples. Response optimization revealed that 604 & mu;s treatment time and 0.06 & mu;L mL-1 concentration were the optimal treatment parameters with 0.63 composite desirability. Processing of apple juice supplemented with cinnamon essential oils in three different concentrations and processed by pulsed electric field by increased treatment time provided inactivation of endogenous and pathogenic bacteria without adversely affecting the physical, and bioactive properties with an increase in & UDelta;H in thermal properties.image	[Evrendilek, Gulsun Akdemir; Turgut, Bengi Karaoguz] Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Food Engn, Bolu, Turkiye; [Turgut, Bengi Karaoguz] Zonguldak Directorate Prov Agr & Forestry, Food & Feed Dept, Zonguldak, Turkiye; [Evrendilek, Gulsun Akdemir] Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Food Engn, Golkoy Campus, Bolu, Turkiye	Abant Izzet Baysal University; Abant Izzet Baysal University	Evrendilek, GA (corresponding author), Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Food Engn, Golkoy Campus, Bolu, Turkiye.	gevrendilek@ibu.edu.tr			Financial support is provided by TUBITAK (Project no: 104O585) and apple juice concentrates were kindly provided by Dimes Gida San ve Tic A.S.

This study aims to emphasize the significance of nonclassical noncovalent interactions in crystal packing. The crystal structure of 1,1'-(1-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)dibenzene was reported as a representative case. A network of weak interactions governs the arrangement of the molecules within the crystal, encompassing C H center dot center dot center dot X hydrogen bonding (where X= O, Cl, or p), weak Cl center dot center dot center dot Cl symmetrical bonding (classified as Type I halogen-halogen bonding), and C H.H C homopolar dihydrogen contacts (dH.H= 2.348 A). The nature, energetics, and cooperativity of these interactions were evaluated using computational calculations based on dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT/wB97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ). Our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of unconventional noncovalent interactions and their role in crystal packing. The methods and concepts employed are likely to be applicable to other molecular systems in biology, chemistry, and materials science.

Another hepatically expressed OATP-member is OATP2B1. The aim of this study was to test the impact of OATP2B1, which specifically transports CPIII, on CP serum levels, applying novel rat models.Experimental Approach: CPIII transport kinetics and the interplay between OATP2B1 and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) were determined in vitro using the vTF7 expression system. Novel rSlco2b1(-/-) and SLCO2B1(+/+) rat models were characterized for physiological parameters and for CP serum levels. Hepatic and renal expression of transporters involved in CP disposition were determined by real-time qPCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry.Key Results: In vitro experiments revealed differences in transport kinetics comparing human and rat OATP2B1 and showed a consistent, species-specific interplay with hMRP3/rMRP3. Deletion of rOATP2B1 was associated with a trend towards lower CPI serum levels compared with wildtype rats, while CPIII remained unchanged. Comparing SLCO2B1(+/+) with knockout rats revealed an effect of sex: only in females the genetic modification influenced CP serum levels. Analysis of hepatic and renal transporters revealed marginal, but in part, statistically significant differences in rMRP2 abundance, which may contribute to the observed changes in CP serum levels.Conclusion and Implications: Our findings support that factors other than OATP1B transporters are of relevance for basal CP levels. Only in female rats, humanization of SLCO2B1 affects basal CPI and CPIII serum levels, despite isomer selectivity of OATP2B1.

Previously, the authors' group reported a 15MgO-15CaO-8P(2)O(5)-4SiO(2) glass (silicophosphate invert glass [spIG]) containing orthophosphate and orthosilicate structures. Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions in the glass preferentially formed Si-O-Mg and P-O-Ca bonds, respectively, suppressing the release amount of silicate ions in a tris-HCl buffer solution (TBS). In this study, a new 15MgO-15CaO-5P(2)O(5)- 10SiO(2) invert glass without a silicate 3D-network structure was prepared via a melt-quenching method. The new glass exhibits an improved silicate-ion release ability that promotes bone formation. The dissolution amounts of Ca2+ and phosphate ions from the glass into a TBS were similar to those of spIG, but the amounts of Mg2+ and silicate ions increased by similar to 2 and similar to 5 times, respectively. P-31 and Si-29 magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses showed that the glass was composed of orthophosphate and chain silicate structures. Even when the silica content exceeded that of spIG, the formation of a silicate 3D-network was suppressed. The O1s X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated that (Si, P)-O-Mg bonds contribute to the glass formation. In a glass model based on classical molecular dynamics, the oxygen coordination numbers of Mg and Ca were determined as 4-7 and 5-8, respectively. Mg2+ ions are predominantly responsible for bridging the silicate/phosphate structures in this glass and play an important role in tuning the glass formation and the release amount of silicate ions.

XAT processes are unique in that they generate radicals without requiring the use of strong reductants necessary for the traditional single electron transfer (SET) activation of halides. Pathways to achieve XAT in synthetic applications can be categorized into three major sections: i) heteroatom-based activators, ii) metal-based activators, and iii) carbon-based activators among which a-aminoalkyl radicals have taken the center stage. Access to these a-aminoalkyl radicals as XAT reagents has gained significant attention in the past few years due to the robustness of the reactions, the simplicity of the reagents required, and the broadness of their applications. Generation of these a-aminoalkyl radicals is simply achieved through the single electron oxidation of tertiary amines, which after deprotonation at the a-position generates the a-aminoalkyl radicals. Due to the wide scope of tertiary amines available and the tunable nucleophilicity of a-aminoalkyl radical formed, this strategy has become an attractive alternative to heteroatom/metal-based radicals for XAT. In this minireview, we focus our attention on recent (2020-2023) developments and uses of this robust technology to mediate XAT processes.

However, there is still a lack of quantitative understanding regarding how tree demography responds to environmental factors, particularly different water conditions, and how plant functional traits contribute to interspecific differences in this response. Using data collected from a forest monitoring plot, meteorological observations and trait measurements on Barro Colorado Island in Panama-one of the most studied sites, we investigated the mortality, recruitment, growth and population dynamics of 165 tree species from 1990 to 2014 and examined the influence of functional traits in determining the interspecific differences in tree demography. We also employed parametric accelerated failure time models to assess the impact of environmental conditions, functional traits and individual tree characteristics on tree survival time. We find that water stress drives the temporal dynamics of tree demography. During the high water stress period, the increase in mortality rates and decrease in recruitment rates caused negative population changes for species. In contrast, the increase in recruitment rates and decline in mortality rates during the low water stress period positively affected the population of species. Wood density and P50 (xylem water potential at 50% loss of maximum hydraulic conductivity) are significantly correlated with species-level mortality, recruitment and growth rates, indicating that traits related to resource allocation and hydraulic safety dictate the interspecific differences in demographic rates. Our results demonstrate that water stress and traits related to resource allocation and hydraulic safety jointly mediate tree demography in this tropical forest. High mortality and low recruitment under high water stress may especially cause a decline in fast-growing species. Therefore, timely recovery of recruitment under favourable water conditions is crucial for the forest dynamics.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

Such information is important for practitioners as a basis for social comparison when they are targeting behavior reduction goals for neurodivergent clients. We distributed a survey to parents of children aged 1-10 years without a developmental diagnosis in which parents reported frequency of five problem behaviors across a 24-h period, as well as commonly targeted replacement behaviors. Problem behavior was reported across all age groups to varying degrees based on topography and age. Replacement behaviors, such as waiting and tolerating denials generally improved as children increased in age but still largely remained below 80% of opportunities. The present study may serve as a reference for researchers and clinicians to set goals that are developmentally appropriate.

Liver cirrhosis was assessed by clinical outcomes, histological studies, and the expression of related genes at the mRNA and protein levels. Results: The patients with BCS had better liver function after EV treatment, evidenced by an increased albumin level and reduced total bilirubin, ALT, and AST. The imaging findings suggested an amelioration of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, including increased portal vein velocity (13.52 +/- 8.89 cm/s vs. 17.51 +/- 6.67 cm/s, p < 0.001) and decreased liver stiffness (30.37 +/- 6.39 kPa vs. 23.70 +/- 7.99 kPa, p < 0.001), portal vein diameter (14.97 +/- 3.42 mm vs. 13.36 +/- 2.89 mm, p < 0.001), and spleen volume (870.00 +/- 355.61 cm(3) vs. 771.36 +/- 277.45 cm(3), p < 0.001). Furthermore, histological studies revealed that EV treatment resulted in a restoration of liver architecture with reduced extracellular matrix deposition. Meanwhile, hepatic angiogenesis and inflammation, which have a close relationship with cirrhosis, were also inhibited. In addition, the state of hepatocytes switches from apoptosis to proliferation after EV treatment. Conclusions: BCS-induced liver cirrhosis could be reversed by EV treatment from macroscopic to microscopic dimensions. Our study may provide further insights into understanding BCS and treating cirrhosis.

Current treatment against CDI still relies on antibiotics, which also damage normal flora and increase the risk of CDI recurrence. Therefore, alternative therapies that are more effective against C. difficile bacteria and spores are urgently needed. Here, we designed an oxidation process using H2O2 containing PBS solution to generate Cl- and peroxide molecules that further process Ag and Au ions to form nanoboxes with Ag-Au peroxide coat covering Au shell and AgCl core (AgAu-based nanoboxes). The AgAu-based nanoboxes efficiently disrupted the membrane structure of bacteria/spores of C. difficile after 30-45 min exposure to the highly reactive Ag/Au peroxide surface of the nano structures. The Au-enclosed AgCl provided sustained suppression of the growth of 2 x 10(7 )pathogenic Escherichia coli for up to 19 days. In a fecal bench ex vivo test and in vivo CDI murine model, biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy of the AuAg nanoboxes to attenuate CDI was demonstrated by restoring the gut microbiota and colon mucosal structure. The treatment successfully rescued the CDI mice from death and prevented their recurrence mediated by vancomycin treatment. The significant outcomes indicated that the new peroxide-derived AgAu-based nanoboxes possess great potential for future translation into clinical application as a new alternative therapeutic strategy against CDI.

AgNPRs were functionalized with lipoic acid (LA) and successfully integrated with UV-visible spectrophotometry for simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers such as & gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), selenite, and myoglobin. The as-prepared LA-AgNPRs exhibited surface plasmon resonance (SPR) characteristic peak at 660 nm. The SPR band of LA-AgNPRs was blue-shifted to 439, 390, and 479 nm upon the addition of GABA, selenite, and myoglobin, respectively. The limits of detection are 6.32, 0.35 and 20.40 nM for GABA, selenite, and myoglobin, respectively. The LA-AgNPRs sensor displays potential prospect to detect three biomarkers GABA, selenite, and myoglobin in biofluid samples. Lipoic acid was functionalized on the surfaces of silver nanoprisms for colorimetric sensing of GABA, selenite and myoglobin with different spectral characteristics. This method exhibited the detection limits of 6.32, 0.35 and 20.40 nM for GABA, selenite, and myoglobin, respectively.

The superheated steam treatment is applied to the starch at 130 and 170? for 1 and 4 min, then dried at 50 ? and stored. Moisture adsorption isotherms are performed at 25 ?, and data are fitted to the Oswin, GAB, and Peleg models. Structural characterization is done using XRD and FTIR, thermal analysis using DSC, and functional characterization include water absorption capacity (WAC), oil absorption capacity (OAC), and syneresis. The QS170/4 treatment shows a reduction in crystallinity index of up to 48.24%, with the appearance of the amylose-lipid complex, an increase in initial and final gelatinization temperatures, and a decrease in enthalpy of up to 39.53%. For modified starches, WAC and OAC increase by 9% and 7%, respectively, and syneresis decreases significantly by 17.4%. The results demonstrate the feasibility of modifying quinoa starch with superheated steam treatment, which, unlike other methods, has the advantage of altering the amylose and amylopectin chains in just a few minutes. Thus, the results show a new perspective for the use of superheated steam in starch modification.

We present a new, simple, and high-throughput platform for multi-color epigenetic analysis. The novelty of our approach is the ability to multiplex methylation and de-methylation signals in the same assay. We utilize an engineered methyltransferase enzyme that recognizes and labels all unmodified CpG sites with a fluorescent cofactor. In combination with the already established labeling of the de-methylation mark 5-hydroxymethylcytosine via enzymatic glycosylation, we obtained a robust platform for simultaneous epigenetic analysis of these marks. We assessed the global epigenetic levels in multiple samples of colorectal cancer and observed a 3.5-fold reduction in 5hmC levels but no change in DNA methylation levels between sick and healthy individuals. We also measured epigenetic modifications in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and observed a decrease in both modification levels (5-hydroxymethylcytosine: whole blood 30 %; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 40 %. 5-methylcytosine: whole blood 53 %; PBMCs 48 %). Our findings propose using a simple blood test as a viable method for analysis, simplifying sample handling in diagnostics. Importantly, our results highlight the assay's potential for epigenetic evaluation of clinical samples, benefiting research and patient management. Dual-color global labelling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and umCpG by multi-color fluorescent labelling. We apply an engineered methyltransferase enzyme specific for unmodified CpG to incorporate a modified cofactor that binds to a fluorophore by click chemistry. In combination with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine labelling via enzymatic glycosylation, we incorporate spectrally distinct colour for each epigenetic mark, enabling simultaneous quantification in different cancer types.**image	[Avraham, Sigal; Margalit, Sapir; Michaeli, Yael; Zirkin, Shahar; Torchinsky, Dmitry; Gilat, Noa; Bahr, Omer; Nifker, Gil; Ebenstein, Yuval] Tel Aviv Univ Tel Aviv Yafo, Dept Chem, Dept Biomed Engn, Raymond & Beverly SacklerFaculty Exact Sci, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Schuetz, Leonie; Kaever, Larissa; Dankers, Andreas; Weinhold, Elmar] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Organ Chem, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Koren-Michowitz, Maya] Shamir Med Ctr, Hematol Dept, IL-70300 Beer Yaagov, Israel; [Avraham, Sigal; Michaeli, Yael; Zirkin, Shahar; Torchinsky, Dmitry; Gilat, Noa; Bahr, Omer; Nifker, Gil; Ebenstein, Yuval] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Chem, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel	RWTH Aachen University; Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh); Tel Aviv University	Ebenstein, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ Tel Aviv Yafo, Dept Chem, Dept Biomed Engn, Raymond & Beverly SacklerFaculty Exact Sci, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.; Weinhold, E (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Organ Chem, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.; Ebenstein, Y (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Chem, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.	elmar.weinhold@oc.rwth-aachen.de; uv@post.tau.ac.il		Koren-Michowitz, Maya/0000-0002-7223-328X	<italic>This work was supported by the European Research Council consolidator [grant number 817811] to Y.E; Israel Science Foundation [grant number 771/21] to Y.E; The National Institute of Health/The National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH/NHGRI) [g [771/21]; European Research Council [R01HG009190]; Israel Science Foundation [NATI 61976]; National Institute of Health/The National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH/NHGRI); Israel Innovation Authority [13GW0282B]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research;  [817811]	<italic>This work was supported by the European Research Council consolidator [grant number 817811] to Y.E; Israel Science Foundation [grant number 771/21] to Y.E; The National Institute of Health/The National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH/NHGRI) [g; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation); National Institute of Health/The National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH/NHGRI); Israel Innovation Authority; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); 	<ITALIC>This work was supported by the European Research Council consolidator [grant number 817811] to Y.E; Israel Science Foundation [grant number 771/21] to Y.E; The National Institute of Health/The National Human Genome Research Institute (NIH/NHGRI) [grant number R01HG009190] to Y.E; and Israel Innovation Authority and German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [NATI 61976 and 13GW0282B] to Y.E and E.W.

Traditional metal exsolution processes on perovskites are often achieved by using the reducing hydrogen gas; however, this is not effective for the relatively stable phase, such as Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides. To address this issue, triphenylphosphine is proposed to be a reduction promotor for accelerating the reduction and migration of the target metal atoms, aiming to achieve the effective exsolution of metallic species from Ruddlesden-Popper-type parent perovskites. Upon oxygen evolution reaction, these exsolved metallic aggregates are reconstructed into oxyhydroxides as the real active centers. After further modification by low-percentage iridium oxide nanoclusters, the optimal catalyst delivered an overpotential as low as 305 mV for generating the density of 10 mA cm-2, outperforming these reported noble metal-containing perovskite-based alkaline oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. This work provides a potential approach to activate catalytically inert oxides through promoting surface metal exsolution and explores a novel class of Ruddlesden-Popper-type oxides for electrocatalytic applications.

Three Oxidative Addition Routes of Alkali Metal Aluminyls to Dihydridoaluminates and Reactivity with CO<sub>2</sub>	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						alkali-metals; CO2 reduction; dihydridoaluminates; Meisenheimer intermediate; oxidative addition	SECONDARY SILANES; REDUCTION; COMPLEXES; HYDRIDES; SI	Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoalu-minate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(2)] (AM =Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp](2-) - [O(SiMe(2)NDipp)(2)](2-); Dipp = 2,6-iPr(2)C(6)H(3)) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM=Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydro-genation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM=Li-Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4-CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O))(2){Al-(NONDipp)(H))(2)(C6H6)], containing the 1,4-dialuminated [C6H6](2-) dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4-CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al -H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis-formate AM[Al-(NONDipp)(O2CH)(2)] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.

Diverse and variable community structure of picophytoplankton across the Laurentian Great Lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access							PHOTOTROPHIC PICOPLANKTON; SYNECHOCOCCUS; ERIE; PICOCYANOBACTERIA; PHYTOPLANKTON; CYANOBACTERIA; POPULATIONS; ABUNDANCE; ALIGNMENT; DYNAMICS	The Laurentian Great Lakes provide economic support to millions of people, drive biogeochemical cycling, and are an important natural laboratory for characterizing the fundamental components of aquatic ecosystems. Small phytoplankton are important contributors to the food web in much of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here, for the first time, we reveal and quantify eight phenotypically distinct picophytoplankton populations across the Lakes using a multilaser flow cytometry approach, which distinguishes cells based on their pigment phenotype. The distributions and diversity of picophytoplankton flow populations varied across lakes and depths, with Lake Erie standing out with the highest diversity. By sequencing sorted cells, we identified several distinct lineages of Synechococcales spanning Subclusters 5.2 and 5.3. Distinct genotypic clusters mapped to phenotypically similar flow populations, suggesting that there may not be a clear one-to-one mapping between genotypes and phenotypes. This suggests genome-level differentiation between lakes but some degree of phenotypic convergence in pigment characteristics. Our results demonstrate that ecological selection for locally adapted populations may outpace homogenization by physical transport in this interconnected system. Given the reliance of the Lakes on in situ primary production as a source for organic carbon, this work sets the foundation to test how the community structure of small primary producers corresponds to biogeochemical and food web functions of the Great Lakes and other freshwater systems.

Specific sensors recognize cytoplasmic mtDNA to promote cytokine production. Cytoplasmic mtDNA can also be secreted extracellularly, leading to sterile inflammation. However, the mode of secretion of mtDNA out of cells upon noxious stimuli and its relevance to human disease remain unclear. Here, we show that pyroptotic cells secrete mtDNA encapsulated within exosomes. Activation of caspase-1 leads to mtDNA leakage from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm via gasdermin-D. Caspase-1 also induces intraluminal membrane vesicle formation, allowing for cellular mtDNA to be taken up and secreted as exosomes. Encapsulation of mtDNA within exosomes promotes a strong inflammatory response that is ameliorated upon exosome biosynthesis inhibition in vivo. We further show that monocytes derived from patients with Behcet's syndrome (BS), a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder, show enhanced caspase-1 activation, leading to exosome-mediated mtDNA secretion and similar inflammation pathology as seen in BS patients. Collectively, our findings support that mtDNA-containing exosomes promote inflammation, providing new insights into the propagation and exacerbation of inflammation in human inflammatory diseases.

To address this issue, we systematise the current literature with a hybrid bibliometric method that combines co-citation and bibliographic coupling analysis for the first time in entrepreneurial intention studies to show the field's knowledge base and research fronts and to examine how divergent perspectives have challenged the core knowledge of the field. We highlight three recurring dimensions of entrepreneurial intention studies: (1) personal factors, (2) social factors and (3) investigational settings. In addition to introducing new constructs, divergent perspectives have emphasised the interplay between these components and challenged the mechanisms connecting them. Based on these findings, we extend previous classifications in the literature by providing a framework that integrates divergent perspectives with the field's knowledge base, helping establish future research avenues and improving the theorising process of entrepreneurial intention.

Inspired by such processes, this study introduces a hydrogel system capable of mechanically activated and chemically transduced self-destruction. Our judiciously designed hydrogels can mechanically generate radicals that are processed and amplified in a self-propagating radical de-crosslinking reaction, ultimately leading to mechanically triggered self-immolation. We put such systems to work in mechano-induced debonding, and in a bilayer actuator, where swelling-induced bending generates sufficient force for selective degradation of one layer, leading to autonomous self-regulation associated with unbending. Our work helps define design criteria for molecularly controlled adaptive and self-regulating materials with embodied mechano-chemical information processing, and showcases their potential for adhesives and soft robotics. This study presents a hydrogel system that self-destroys after mechanical activation via the combination of a mechano-to-chemo signal translation and a chemical signal amplifier module to trigger many chain breaks following one single mechano event. Self-regulating soft robotic elements and mechano-induced debonding in adhesives can be realized.image	[Lupfer, Claudius; Seitel, Sebastian; Skarsetz, Oliver; Walther, Andreas] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Chem, Life Like Mat & Syst, Duesbergweg 10-14, D-55218 Mainz, Germany	Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz	Walther, A (corresponding author), Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Chem, Life Like Mat & Syst, Duesbergweg 10-14, D-55218 Mainz, Germany.	andreas.walther@uni-mainz.de		Lupfer, Claudius/0000-0002-2229-1297; Skarsetz, Oliver/0000-0002-1540-1873	This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionamp;apos;s Horizon 2020 Program (No. 101001638).

However, the optimal time of the day to engage in MVPA for weight management is controversial. This study is designed to investigate the influence of the diurnal pattern of MVPA on the association between MVPA and obesity.MethodsA total of 5285 participants in the 2003 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were cross-sectionally analyzed. The diurnal pattern of objectively measured MVPA was classified into three clusters by K-means clustering analysis: morning (n = 642); midday (n = 2456); and evening (n = 2187). The associations of MVPA level and the diurnal pattern with obesity were tested.ResultsA strong linear association between MVPA and obesity was found in the morning group, whereas a weaker curvilinear association between MVPA and obesity was observed in the midday and evening groups, respectively. Among those who met the physical activity guidelines, the adjusted means for BMI were 25.9 (95% CI: 25.2-26.6), 27.6 (95% CI: 27.1-28.1), and 27.2 (95% CI: 26.8-27.7) kg/m2 in the morning, midday, and evening groups, respectively, and for waist circumference were 91.5 (95% CI: 89.4-93.6), 95.8 (95% CI: 94.7-96.9), and 95.0 (95% CI: 93.9-96.1) cm, respectively.ConclusionsThe diurnal pattern of MVPA influences the association between MVPA and obesity. The promising role of morning MVPA for weight management warrants further investigation.

Preparing students to address the social determinants of health in integrated care settings	CLINICAL TEACHER			English	Article; Early Access								BackgroundHealth professionals are increasingly being called to address the social determinants of health (SDOH) and, to do so effectively, often requires an integrated approach to care. As a result, accreditation standards across multiple professions have emphasised the importance of interprofessional education (IPE).ApproachThis paper describes large-scale, community-engaged learning that is required annually of students from nursing, pharmacy, public health, and social work. Through a series of asynchronous and synchronous activities that are informed by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative core competencies, students are trained to be SDOH change makers who can readily adopt integrated care service delivery frameworks into their future practice.EvaluationApproximately 1000 students have participated in this event since the University launched its IPE curriculum in 2017. Student consistently report achievement of the course learning objectives, with 91% of students reporting that the learning activities enhanced their understanding of their professional roles/responsibilities in regards to addressing poverty and food insecurity.ImplicationsTwo key lessons learned from these efforts are described, including the benefits of a trauma-informed pedagogical approach and special considerations for large-scale learning.

Some centrosomal components are required for full activation of the DNA damage response. However, whether the centrosome regulates specific DNA repair pathways is not known. Here, we show that centrosome presence is required to fully activate recombination, specifically to completely license its initial step, the so-called DNA end resection. Furthermore, we identify a centriolar structure, the subdistal appendages, and a specific factor, CEP170, as the critical centrosomal component involved in the regulation of recombination and resection. Cells lacking centrosomes or depleted for CEP170 are, consequently, hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Moreover, low levels of CEP170 in multiple cancer types correlate with an increase of the mutation burden associated with specific mutational signatures and a better prognosis, suggesting that changes in CEP170 can act as a mutation driver but could also be targeted to improve current oncological treatments.

Shear wave elastography was used to evaluate the periphery of the lateral and medial meniscus in both knees. To assess the mean differences in Young's modulus values between male and female groups, a one-way ANOVA and independent samples t-test were conducted. In addition, a Pearson correlation coefficient test was used to analyze the correlation between the elastic values of the meniscus and age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).ResultsThere were no significant differences in elastic values between the lateral meniscus of the left and right sides or between the medial meniscus of the left and right sides within the same gender group (P > .05). Stiffness values of the medial meniscus were higher in each gender group than those of the lateral meniscus (P < .01). Additionally, males demonstrated higher stiffness values than females (P < .01). As age increased, the Young's modulus of the meniscus increased significantly (r > .75, P < .01).ConclusionShear wave elastography can serve as an adjunctive tool to aid in the assessment of knee meniscal elasticity.

Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) facilitates the angiogenesis of pulmonary endothelial cells via activating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 promotes the expression of transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), which promotes inflammation and angiogenesis via the up-regulation of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). In the present study, we aimed to identify the formation of NET and its role in CNV. Our results showed that NET levels were increased in a mouse laser-induced CNV model via oxidative stress, whereas the inhibition of NET alleviated CNV. In vitro, NET activated the TLR4/HIF-1 alpha pathway in human choroidal endothelial cells (HCECs). Additionally, NET increased the transcription and expression of MMP-9 and IL-1 beta in HCECs via activating the TLR4/HIF-1 alpha pathway. Meanwhile, NET promoted the inflammatory response accompanied by the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HCECs in a MMP-9- and IL-1 beta-dependent manner. In conclusion, NET was up-regulated in CNV and promoted the formation of CNV via activating the TLR4/HIF-1 alpha pathway in choroidal endothelial cells. Our data uncovered the novel role of NET in promoting the formation of CNV. The underlying mechanism of NET could be targeted to delay the process of CNV.

However, its role as a prognostic marker in cabazitaxel chemotherapy remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the clinical significance of serum testosterone levels before cabazitaxel chemotherapy. Methods: This single-institution, retrospective study included 47 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who received cabazitaxel therapy. Serum testosterone levels were measured before the initiation of cabazitaxel therapy. Results: Progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different between patients with high and low serum testosterone levels. Analysis of patients aged <70 years revealed that those with high serum testosterone levels (total testosterone level > 0.055 ng/mL) had significantly longer OS than those with low serum testosterone levels (total testosterone level < 0.055 ng/mL, p = 0.012). Multivariate analysis revealed that low serum testosterone levels (hazard ratio [HR] = 11.874, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.076-67.953, p = 0.005) and high prostate-specific antigen levels (HR = 18.051, 95% CI 2.462-132.347, p = 0.004) in the pretreatment phase were independent prognostic factors for OS in patients receiving cabazitaxel therapy. Conclusions: Serum testosterone level may be a prognostic marker for cabazitaxel therapy in patients with mCRPC who are younger than 70 years, and high serum testosterone levels may lead to longer survival.

Subjects and methods: Three hundred and sixty patients who visited the Senri Dental Clinic, affiliated with the Sunstar Foundation, and were being treated for periodontal diseases between 11 January 2017 and 10 April 2017 were enrolled. A total of 323 respondents (101 men and 222 women) were considered eligible. Nervous tendencies were investigated using the Fujinami neurotic index (FNI) and its derivative, the neurotic index (NI). Patients with NIs of >= 20 were included in the ' needs caution ' group, whereas those with NIs of < 19 comprised the ' healthy ' group. The plaque score; periodontal pocket depth; bleeding on probing degree; gingival recession; crevice defects; oral conditions, such as cervical fillings and lifestyle habits were compared between the groups. Results and discussion: No statistically significant differences in oral status were observed between the groups. On the other hand, the needs caution group had significantly longer brushing durations and lower usage of auxiliary teeth cleaning tools than the healthy group. Sleep duration was significantly shorter in the needs caution group than in the healthy group. Conclusions: Patients with strong nervous tendencies had long oral brushing durations and low usage of auxiliary cleaning tools. However, these factors did not negatively affect oral health status. These results could aid in understanding patients with strong nervous tendencies and in developing appropriate dental health guidance measures.

The objective of this study was to analyze the stability of online grooming victimization among minors and its relationship with demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, and sexual orientation), emotions of shame and guilt, and depression and anxiety symptoms.MethodsThe participants were 746 adolescents aged 12-14 years when the study started (Mage = 13.34, SD = 0.87) who completed self-reports at Time 1 (T1) and 1 year later at Time 2 (T2). Among them, 400 were girls, 344 were boys, and two were nonbinary. At each time point, the minors self-reported their online grooming experiences during the previous year.ResultsThe results showed that 11.8% (n = 89) of the participants were T1-victims, 13% (n = 95) were T2-victims, and 11% (n = 81) were stable victims of online grooming. Stability in victimization was related to being older, being a sexual minority, being born abroad, having separated or divorced parents, and having parents with a lower education level. Stable victims showed higher shame and guilt scores at T1 than did T1-victims, indicating that elevated levels of shame and guilt could contribute to the persistence of online grooming over time.ConclusionsOverall, adolescents in the stable victim category presented more depression and anxiety symptoms. Intervention strategies should address emotions related to victimization, such as shame and guilt, as well as depression and anxiety symptoms.

Color-responsive ML sensing, combined with quantitative evaluation of loaded stress, is preferred for visual description and sensing reliability. In this work, Yb2+ and Mn2+ ions co-doped MgF2 with a fascinating ratiometric ML performance are successfully explored. ML color can be manipulated based on the distinct stress-dependent ML intensity of the activators. Furthermore, a self-activated orange persistent ML is observed even after the removal of the mechanics stimuli, allowing a delayed stress sensing with the memorized optical signals. Accordingly, a visualized stress sensing with the as-explored ML composites using the ultraviolet curing 3D printing technique is demonstrated for structural mechanics. Herein, a feasible optical description of the loaded stress distribution in space for objects free from concerns with dimensions and geometrical shapes can be realized, benefiting the study of 3D structural mechanics, especially for complex structures. By introducing Yb2+ and Mn2+ into MgF2, stress-regulated mechanoluminescence discoloration is achieved and demonstrates a persistent mechanoluminescence phenomenon.

By measuring the absorption coefficient & alpha;(h & nu;) and plotting (& alpha;hv)12$(\alpha {hv})<^>{\frac{1}{2}}$ versus photon energy h & nu;, a value for the optical gap (Tauc gap) is determined. In this way non-direct optical transitions between approximately parabolic bands can be examined. In the last decades, a modification of this method for (poly-) crystalline semiconductors has become popular to study direct and indirect interband transitions. For this purpose, (ah & nu;)n (n = 12$\frac{1}{2}$, 2) is plotted against h & nu; to determine a value of the electronic bandgap. Due to the ease of performing UV-vis measurements, this method has nowadays become a standard to analyze various (poly-) crystalline solids, regardless of their different electronic structure. Although this leads partially to widely varying values of the respective bandgap of nominally identical materials, there is still no study that critically questions which peculiarities in the electronic structure prevent a use of the Tauc plot for (poly-) crystalline solids and to which material classes this applies. This study aims to close this gap by discussing the Tauc plot and its limiting factors for exemplary (poly-) crystalline solids with different electronic structures. The Tauc plot is probably the most commonly used method to determine the size of bandgaps. This perspective shows that, despite the establishment of this method, the Tauc plot should be used with caution, since various peculiarities in the electronic structure can prevent its application.image	[Klein, Julian; Kampermann, Laura; Bacher, Gerd] Univ Duisburg Essen, Werkstoffe Elektrotech, Bismarckstr 81, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Klein, Julian; Kampermann, Laura; Bacher, Gerd] Univ Duisburg Essen, CENIDE, Bismarckstr 81, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany; [Mockenhaupt, Benjamin; Behrens, Malte] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Inorgan Chem, Univ Str 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany; [Mockenhaupt, Benjamin; Behrens, Malte] Univ Duisburg Essen, CENIDE, Univ Str 7, D-45141 Essen, Germany; [Mockenhaupt, Benjamin] Delft Univ Technol, Catalysis Engn, Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands; [Behrens, Malte] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Inorgan Chem, Max Eyth Str 2, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Strunk, Jennifer] Univ Rostock, Leibniz Inst Catalysis, Albert Einstein Str 29a, D-18059 Rostock, Germany	University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen; Delft University of Technology; University of Kiel; Leibniz Institut fur Katalyse e.V. an der Universitat Rostock (LIKAT); University of Rostock	Bacher, G (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Werkstoffe Elektrotech, Bismarckstr 81, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.; Bacher, G (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, CENIDE, Bismarckstr 81, D-47057 Duisburg, Germany.	gerd.bacher@uni-due.de	Behrens, Malte/A-3035-2017	Behrens, Malte/0000-0003-3407-5011	Open access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

The reverse process of polarization has been associated with individual uncertainty, social conflict and societal distrust, tension, or even schisms. In conversations, the experience of consensus is shaped by both content and aspects of the form of conversation, which indicate whether people are on the same wavelength. In two conversation studies (N = 268) we aimed (1) to examine where the conversational experience of consensus originates and (2) to test which conversational behaviours enhance attitude convergence between conversation partners. The results show that, although actual attitudinal differences were only predictive in Study 2, both conversational content (e.g., disagreement) and form (e.g., experience of flow) consistently predicted the experience of consensus. Convergence of attitudes was harder to predict: most conversational factors were unrelated to attitudinal convergence and conversational flow either increased or decreased attitudinal convergence depending on the particular context.

For example, rapid proton transport in ATPases is attributed to confined channel spaces and conjugated sites. According to molecular dynamics simulations, the confined spaces and conjugated sites in nanochannels can enhance ion transport. Herein, it is demonstrated that the ATPase-like structures of sulfonic acid-modified covalent organic framework nanochannels, which promote the formation of highly ordered and continuous water molecular chains and confined spaces, can support ion (H+, Li+, Na+, and K+) transport rates that are an order of magnitude higher than those of bulk water. The ion transport rates in the nanochannel are superior to those in other artificial channels. Moreover, the selectivity of cations in the nanochannel is evaluated using the diffusion potential with a concentration gradient. The simulations and experimental results demonstrate that confined spaces and conjugated sites are crucial for efficient ion transport in nanochannels modified by sulfonic acid groups as cation conductor materials. By mimicking the distribution of & beta;-binding sites in the F1 region of ATPases, the NUS-9 channel to achieve rapid ion transport is exploited. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results demonstrate that high cation selectivity and transportation occur in the channel, which is attributed to the NUS-9 channel providing a continuous and confined space and conjugated sites.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH	[Lu, Bingxin; Xiao, Tianliang; Zhang, Caili; He, Jianwei; Zhai, Jin] Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Biomed Engn, Key Lab Bioinspired Smart Interfacial Sci & Tech, Sch Chem,Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Tianliang] Beihang Univ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China	Beihang University; Beihang University	Zhai, J (corresponding author), Beihang Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Biomed Engn, Key Lab Bioinspired Smart Interfacial Sci & Tech, Sch Chem,Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.	zhaijin@buaa.edu.cn			This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (21975009).; National Natural Science Foundation;  [21975009]	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (21975009).(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (21975009).		59	0	0	8	8	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA		2688-4062		SMALL STRUCT	Small Struct.	2023 SEP 3	2023										10.1002/sstr.202300190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sstr.202300190		SEP 2023	8	Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science	Q4SL0		gold			2023-10-18	WOS:001057433500001

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy shows that the WO3 nanorods are embellished with Co3O4 nanostructure. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the presence of oxygen vacancy on the Co3O4 coupled with WO3 heterojunction. Compared to bare WO3 and pure Co3O4, the Co3O4/WO3 heterojunction sensor shows significant sensitivity to NOx at 200 degrees C. The sensor exhibits higher linearity from 0.4 to 10 ppm of NOx, with a sensing response of 4.4-93%. The NOx sensitivity of the Co3O4/WO3 heterojunction sensor is ninefold higher than that of the pure WO3 sensor. Even in a high humidity (84%) environment, the Co3O4/WO3 heterojunction sensor demonstrates high NOx sensitivity. The sensor maintains remarkable stability measured for up to 4 weeks. The possible NOx sensing mechanism of the Co3O4/WO3 heterojunction is additionally discussed.

A systematic review of randomized trials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DENTAL HYGIENE			English	Review; Early Access						dental scaling; meta-analysis; periodontal debridement; root planning; systematic review	MECHANICAL PLAQUE REMOVAL; DISEASES; PAIN; METAANALYSIS; PREVENTION	ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with at least 6 months of follow-up, on whether professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR) including supragingival scaling should be performed prior and separately from subgingival scaling and root planning (SRP) in nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT), in terms of clinical and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (CRD42020219759).MethodsThe MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS and Web of Science electronic databases, as well as grey literature sources, were searched by two independent reviewers up to May 2023. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) was used for quality appraisal and GRADE for assessing the certainty of evidence. Random-effects pairwise meta-analyses compared the changes in probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and bleeding on probing (BoP) of a stepwise NSPT approach (PMPR prior and separately from SRP) and conventional one-step NSPT through mean differences (MDs) and associated confidence intervals (95% CI).ResultsTwo RCTs were included, including data of 77 participants with severe periodontitis. One RCT presents high risk of bias and the other has some concerns. No significant differences were found between the stepwise approach and performing both steps simultaneously for any clinical outcomes, with overall very low certainty on evidence. No adverse effects were detected and there was no data on PROs.ConclusionsThere is very-low certainty evidence of no significant difference on PPD and BoP reductions and CAL gain between supragingival scaling performed prior and separately from SRP and conventional one-step NSPT.

J	Oral, N; Basal, G				Oral, Nur; Basal, Guldemet			Smart Antifouling and Self-Cleaning Membrane for Effective Oil/Water Separation	MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						CA nanofibers; oil-water emulsion separation; PNIPAM hydrogel; self-cleaning ability	WATER; FABRICATION; WETTABILITY; MORPHOLOGY	A novel membrane consisting of cellulose acetate (CA) nanofibers and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microparticles is successfully fabricated by simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying. The CA/PNIPAM membrane has highly effective gravity-driven separation performances for both oil/water mixtures and oil-in-water emulsions. It separates oil droplets from oil-in-water mixtures and oil-water emulsions with rejection rates of 99.83% and 96%, respectively. In order to examine the contribution of PNIPAM particles, the performance of the CA/PNIPAM membrane is compared with the CA membrane. Increased hydrophilicity due to the inclusion of the PNIPAM particles between CA nanofibers results in a higher rejection ratio and superior antifouling performance. While the CA membrane becomes unusable after 10 cycles during the separation of the oil-water emulsion, the CA/PNIPAM membrane is still in good shape after 20 cycles. The self-cleaning ability of the membrane is examined through the permeation flux below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM. The reversible thermo-responsive flux variation proves that the pore sizes increase at temperatures above the LCST of PNIPAM. Moreover, when the lubricating oil-water emulsion is filtered through the membrane, the permeate changes from clear to turbid due to the nonretained oil particles as the temperature passes through the LCST. A novel cellulose acetate/poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (CA/PNIPAM) membrane, created by simultaneous electrospinning and electrospraying, effectively separates oil/water mixtures and emulsions. It demonstrates rejection rates of 99.83% and 96% for oil droplets in oil-in-water mixtures and emulsions, respectively. Additionally, the membrane's self-cleaning ability is proven by reversible thermo-responsive flux changes above PNIPAM's lower critical solution temperature, indicating pore expansion.image	[Oral, Nur] Ege Univ, Dept Endocrinol, TR-35040 Bornova, Izmir, Turkiye; [Basal, Guldemet] Ege Univ, Dept Text Engn, Dept Text Engn, TR-35040 Bornova, Izmir, Turkiye	Ege University; Ege University	Basal, G (corresponding author), Ege Univ, Dept Text Engn, Dept Text Engn, TR-35040 Bornova, Izmir, Turkiye.	guldemet.basal@ege.edu.tr			This work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) with project number 119M355.; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK);  [119M355]	This work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) with project number 119M355.(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); 	This work was supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) with project number 119M355.		51	0	0	3	3	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1022-1352	1521-3935		MACROMOL CHEM PHYS	Macromol.

The trading zone approach has started to examine its role as a coordination tool, but there is little empirical research on how it can foster network's collaboration. Through an exploration of the COP participants' positions as boundary spanners, this study puts forward the trading zone perspective, showing that in London it has become a regular mechanism of collaboration and coordination. It argues that boundary spanners operate at multiple boundaries that enable network's collaboration and coordination, and the relational character of the COP create bonds of trust that foster collaboration and common understandings on the role of communication, collaboration, information sharing, and coordination for the security of all. We show that the COP is a relational space that creates a sense of belonging to a common community of security that believes in the role of networks' information sharing and collaboration for urban resilience.

Using empirical data from a panel of Chinese listed A-share firms in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2010 to 2020, we demonstrate that firms following prospector strategies have higher levels of environmental information disclosure compared to those following defender strategies. Our findings also reveal that Confucian culture positively moderates the relationship between business strategy and environmental information disclosure. Specifically, we find that when environmental uncertainty increases, the moderating effect of Confucian culture weakens, while effective legal supervision strengthens the positive moderating effect of Confucian culture. Additionally, our results show that business strategy affects environmental information disclosure through the dual channels of economic benefits contract and social recognition contract. Overall, this research provides valuable insights for corporate sustainable development and effective government environmental governance.

Advances in nanofabrication have enabled the integration of subwavelength-structured metamaterials on optical waveguides, providing unprecedented optical manipulation capabilities beyond classical waveguide-based architectures. In this paper, the polarization space is demonstrated to be fully manipulated by a dielectric metamaterial composed of nanoholes and nanoslots. This approach offers competitive performances for key polarization components, including the polarizer, polarization beam splitter, and polarization-splitter-rotator, while maintaining ultra-compact coupling regions of 18x1 & mu;m2, 16x1.1 & mu;m2, and 13x1 & mu;m2 respectively. The devices are designed by manipulating the phase and amplitude of all possible eigenmodes supported in the waveguide, which is inherently scalable and versatile for on-chip mode and wavefront manipulation. The unique properties of metamaterials provide powerful tools for on-chip polarization manipulation and offer new possibilities for the development of compact and high-performance photonic integrated circuits. The metamaterial-assisted polarization-handling devices have demonstrated full control over the polarization state of light with competitive performance and ultra-compact footprints. Polarization-manipulating devices including the polarizer, polarization beam splitter, and polarization-splitter-rotator, with compact waveguide lengths of 18, 16, and 13 & mu;m, respectively, are demonstrated with low insertion losses and high extinction ratio.image	[Zhao, Yaotian; Xiang, Jinlong; He, An; He, Yu; Guo, Xuhan; Su, Yikai] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Key Lab Adv Opt Commun Syst & Networks, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China	Shanghai Jiao Tong University	Guo, XH (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Key Lab Adv Opt Commun Syst & Networks, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.	guoxuhan@sjtu.edu.cn	Guo, Xuhan/JFK-0496-2023	Guo, Xuhan/0000-0002-4891-0201	This work was financially supported by the National Key Ramp;amp;D Program of China (2021YFB2801903) and the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (62175151, 62105202, and 61835008).

The amount of 5-HTP ingested was estimated between 980 and 1988 mg (35-71 mg/kg). At presentation, the dog demonstrated progressive neurologic abnormalities consistent with serotonin syndrome, including altered mentation and ataxia. Due to the magnitude of the ingested dose and progression of clinical signs, extracorporeal blood purification with intermittent haemodialysis was chosen to expedite clearance of 5-HTP. High-efficiency haemodialysis was initiated, and the dog showed continued clinical improvement throughout the 5-h treatment. Clinical signs resolved completely within 12 h. Sequential blood and urine samples were obtained to document levels of both 5-HTP and serotonin. The dog was discharged 24 h after presentation with complete resolution of clinical signs.New or Unique InformationThis is the first report documenting the serial changes in 5-HTP concentrations during treatment with haemodialysis. A 3-year-old, male neutered Labrador Retriever, weighing 28.2 kg, presented to the emergency department approximately 4-5 h after ingesting a human supplement containing 200 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP).

J	Davoine, T				Davoine, Thomas			Flexicurity, education and optimal labour market policies	LABOUR-ENGLAND			English	Article; Early Access							UNEMPLOYMENT-INSURANCE; EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION; INEQUALITY; BENEFITS; DESIGN; IMPACT	The paper provides a theoretical rationale for flexicurity policies, consisting of low employment protection, generous unemployment insurance and active labour market programmes. Education efforts give access to high productivity firms, more likely to survive and thus exposing less their workers to unemployment risk. Activation programmes support reallocation from risky and unproductive to safer and more productive firms, reducing unemployment. Low employment protection can provide incentives for self-insurance against unemployment risk through education, mitigating the moral hazard cost of unemployment insurance and activation programmes. The paper identifies conditions for flexicurity to be optimal and confronts theoretical predictions to the data.

Cerebrospinal fluid turnover as a driver of brain clearance	NMR IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						brain; cerebrospinal fluid; glymphatic system; MRI; perivascular spaces	INTERSTITIAL FLUID; GLYMPHATIC PATHWAY; IMPAIRMENT; SYSTEM; MRI; FLOW; OSCILLATIONS; ANESTHESIA; PHYSIOLOGY; MECHANISM	Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has historically been considered to function as a sink for brain-derived waste disposal. Recent work suggested that CSF interacts even more intensely with brain tissue than previously recognized, through perivascular spaces that penetrate the brain. Cardiac pulsations, vasomotion, and respiration have been suggested to drive CSF flow in these perivascular spaces, thereby enhancing waste clearance. However, the intrinsic role of CSF production in relation to its distribution volume (turnover) is not an explicit component of recent concepts on brain clearance. Here, we review the work on CSF turnover and volume, focusing on preclinical evidence. Herein, we highlight the use of MRI in establishing CSF-related parameters. We describe the impact of sleep, effect of anesthesia, aging, and hypertension on CSF turnover, and how this relates to brain clearance. Evaluation of the available evidence suggests that CSF turnover is a major determinant in brain clearance. In addition, we propose that several putative drivers of brain clearance, but also conditions associated with impaired clearance, such as aging, may actually relate to altered CSF turnover. Several factors, such as sleep, aging, circadian rhythms, and hypertension, can impact CSF turnover, thereby affecting brain clearance. We propose CSF turnover as an important driver of brain clearance, and impaired clearance might be related to alterations in CSF turnover.image	[Smets, Nina G.; Bakker, Erik N. T.

Because of the substantial and sustained weight loss following bariatric surgery, postsurgical patients are ideal to study the association of weight loss and cancer. MethodsRetrospectively (1982-2019), 21,837 bariatric surgery patients (surgery, 1982-2018) were matched 1:1 by age, sex, and BMI with a nonsurgical comparison group. Procedures included gastric bypass, gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and duodenal switch. Primary outcomes included cancer incidence and mortality, stratified by obesity- and non-obesity-related cancers, sex, cancer stage, and procedure. ResultsBariatric surgery patients had a 25% lower risk of developing any cancers compared with a nonsurgical comparison group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75; 95% CI 0.69-0.81; p < 0.001). Cancer incidence was lower among female (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.62-0.74; p < 0.001) but not male surgery patients, with the HR lower for females than for males (p < 0.001). Female surgery patients had a 41% lower risk for obesity-related cancers (i.e., breast, ovarian, uterine, and colon) compared with nonsurgical females (HR 0.59; 95% CI 0.52-0.66; p < 0.001). Cancer mortality was significantly lower after surgery in females (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.44-0.64; p < 0.001). ConclusionsBariatric surgery was associated with lower all-cancer and obesity-related cancer incidence among female patients. Cancer mortality was significantly lower among females in the surgical group versus the nonsurgical group.

However, their population and distribution were threatened by climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Understanding the impacts of these pressures through mapping distribution and habitat suitability is crucial for identifying high-priority areas and implementing effective conservation and management plans. We predicted the distribution and extent of habitat suitability for Rousettus aegyptiacus and Epomophorus labiatus under climate change scenarios using average predictions from four different algorithms to produce an ensemble model. Seasonal precipitation, population index, land-use land cover, vegetation, and the mean temperature of the driest quarter majorly contributed to the predicted habitat suitability for both species. The current predicted sizes of suitable habitats for R. aegyptiacus and E. labiatus were varied, on average 60,271.4 and 85,176.1 km(2), respectively. The change in species range size for R. aegyptiacus showed gains in suitable areas of 24.4% and 22.8% in 2050 and 2070, respectively. However, for E. labiatus, suitable areas decreased by 0.95% and 2% in 2050 and 2070, respectively. The range size change of suitable areas between 2050 and 2070 for R. aegyptiacus and E. labiatus shows losses of 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. The predicted maps indicate that the midlands and highlands of southern and eastern Ethiopia harbor highly suitable areas for both species. In contrast, the areas in the northern and central highlands are fragmented. The current model findings show that climate change and anthropogenic pressures have notable impacts on the geographic ranges of two species. Moreover, the predicted suitable habitats for both species are found both within and outside of their historical ranges, which has important implications for conservation efforts. Our ensemble predictions are vital for identifying high-priority areas for fruit bat species conservation efforts and management to mitigate climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

J	Alonso-Crespo, IM; Hernández-Agüero, JA				Alonso-Crespo, Ines Maria; Hernandez-Agueero, Juan Antonio			Shedding light on trophic interactions: A field experiment on the effect of human population between latitudes on herbivory and predation patterns	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						bird predation; insect herbivory; latitude; UHI effect and urbanization	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; INSECT HERBIVORY; FEEDING INSECTS; URBAN GRADIENT; NEST PREDATION; PRESSURE; URBANIZATION; DENSITY; BIRDS; CATERPILLARS	Interactions between species within an ecosystem (e.g. predation and herbivory) play a vital role in sustaining the ecosystem functionality, which includes aspects like pest control and nutrient cycling. Unfortunately, human activities are progressively disrupting these trophic relationships, thereby contributing to the ongoing biodiversity decline. Additionally, certain human activities like urbanization may further impact the intensity of these trophic interactions, which are already known to be influenced by latitudinal gradients. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of whether the impact of human population, used as a proxy for human pressure, differs between latitudes. To test it, we selected 18 study sites at two latitudes (i.e. similar to 53 degrees N and similar to 50 degrees N) with varying human population density (HPD). We used artificial caterpillars placed on European beech branches to assess bird predation and took standardized pictures of the leaves to estimate insect herbivory. Remote sensing techniques were used to estimate human pressure. We found that the intensity of bird predation varied in response to HPD, with opposite trends observed depending on the latitude. At our upper latitude, bird predation increased with HPD, while the opposite was observed at the lower latitude. Herbivory was not affected by urbanization and we found higher levels of herbivory in the lower compared to the higher latitude. At the lower latitude, certain species may experience a disadvantage attributed to the urban heat island effect due to their sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. Conversely, at the higher latitude, where minimum temperatures can be a limitation, certain species may benefit from milder winters. Overall, this study highlights the complex and dynamic nature of trophic relationships in the face of human-driven changes to ecosystems. It also emphasizes the importance of considering both human pressure and latitudinal gradients when assessing the ecological consequences of future climate change scenarios, especially in urban environments.

MethodWe analysed the clinical data and patch test results obtained with the European baseline series (BSE) and an EOS, as well as the mode of use of EOs, through a questionnaire included in the patient file. ResultsThe study included 42 patients (79% women, average age 50years) with allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), 8 patients required hospitalization. All patients were sensitized to the EO they used, primarily lavender (Lavandula augustifolia, 8000-28-0), tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia leaf oil, 68647-73-4), ravintsara (Cinnamomum camphora oil, 92201-50-8), and 2 cases were attributed to helichrysum (helichrysum italicum flower absolute, 90045-56-0). 71% had positive patch tests to fragrance mix I or II, 9 only to the EOS and 4 only with their personal EO. Interestingly, 40% of patients did not spontaneously mention the use of EOs, and only 33% received advice on their use at the time of purchase. ConclusionPatch tests with the BSE, limonene and linalool HP, and oxidized tea tree oil is sufficient to detect most EO-sensitized patients. The most important is to test the patient's own used EOs.

Zwitterionic polymers are considered as an attractive alternative to polyethylene glycol because of their biocompatibility and effectiveness to prevent formation of biofilms. To this end, zwitterionic polymers are classified in two categories, namely polybetaines and polyampholytes. Yet, despite a fundamental interest to drive the development of new antifouling materials, the chemical composition of zwitterionic polymer remains severely limited. Here, we show that poly(sulfur ylides) that belong to the largely overlooked class of poly(ylides), effectively prevent the formation of biofilms from pathogenic bacteria. While surface energy analysis reveals strong hydrogen-bond acceptor capabilities of poly(sulfur ylide), membrane damage of pathogenic bacteria induced by poly(sulfur ylides) indicates toxicity towards bacteria while not affecting eucaryotic cells. Such synergistic effect of poly(sulfur ylides) offers distinct advantages over polyethylene glycol when designing new antifouling materials. We expect that our findings will pave the way for the development of a range of ylide-based materials with antifouling properties that have yet to be explored, opening up new directions at the interface of chemistry, biology, and material science. Stronger together: Unlike most zwitterionic materials, including polybetaines, sulfur ylides exhibit minimal charge separation. We show that poly(sulfur ylides) effectively inhibit the adhesion of biomolecules and pathogenic bacteria. Notably, we show that polymeric sulfur ylides create a toxic environment for bacterial cells that surpass the initial hydration barrier while remaining non-toxic to mammalian cells.**image	[Berking, Bela B.; Poulladofonou, Georgia; Karagrigoriou, Dimitrios; Wilson, Daniela A.; Neumann, Kevin] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Mol & Mat, Syst Chem Dept, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands	Radboud University Nijmegen	Wilson, DA; Neumann, K (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Mol & Mat, Syst Chem Dept, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.	d.wilson@science.ru.nl; kevin.neumann@ru.nl	; Wilson, Prof. dr.

J	Darcy, HE; Anderson, PSL				Darcy, Hannah E.; Anderson, Philip S. L.			Morphological variation in the vomer of aquatic and terrestrial spelerpini salamanders	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY			English	Article						morphological diversification; niche lability; plethodontid salamanders	SKULL SHAPE; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION; FAMILY	The vomer is an important tooth-bearing cranial bone in the lungless salamanders (Caudata: Plethodontidae) that serves different functional roles in aquatic versus terrestrial feeding. Vomerine tooth rows that run parallel with the maxillary teeth are thought to help grasp prey while expelling water from the mouth, while posterior extensions of the tooth row may help terrestrial taxa bring prey down the throat. We hypothesize that these two general morphological types will correlate with the habitat (aquatic vs. terrestrial) of adult salamanders. Alternatively, variation in form may be due to taxonomic effects, such that closely related species will have similar vomer morphology regardless of adult habitat. To test this hypothesis, we examined vomer shape on a set of species of the morphologically diverse tribe Spelerpini, in which two of the five genera (Eurycea and Gyrinophilus) include both aquatic and terrestrial species. Data were collected using micro computed tomography (micro-CT) scans from specimens from the Field Museum of Natural History and the Illinois Natural History Survey; additional data was obtained from public online repositories including . Two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses were performed to capture shape variation of both the vomer and the vomerine tooth row. We found clear separation between aquatic and terrestrial taxa, with most of the variation due to differences in the vomerine tooth row. Differences ascribed to habitat use likely correspond to feeding behavior, and the functional role of the vomer in prey processing warrants further investigation in this species-rich salamander family.

MethodsNormal-weight individuals and individuals with obesity underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan and the assessment of impulsivity, food craving, appetite, and implicit bias for food and non-food stimuli. The VTA was used as a seed to map, for each participant, the strength of its functional connections with the rest of the brain. The between-group difference in functional connectivity was then computed, and brain-behavior correlations were performed. ResultsIndividuals with obesity showed hyper-connectivity of the VTA with part of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, recently found to be specialized for food images, and hypo-connectivity with the left inferior frontal gyrus, devoted to cognitive control. VTA-ventral occipitotemporal cortex connectivity was positively associated with food craving and food-related bias; the reverse correlation was observed for VTA-inferior frontal gyrus connectivity. ConclusionsThese findings reveal that, in obesity, food-related visual stimuli become cravingly salient through an imbalanced connectivity of the reward system with sensory-specific regions and the frontal cortex involved in cognitive control.

The residual stress fields induced by DED and LSP are simulated, as well as the effects of different residual stresses on the stress intensity factor and effective stress ratio based on the contour integral method are also analyzed. The microstructure of the LSP region is observed by scanning electron microscope. When the crack length increases from 12 to 22.5 mm, the average effective stress ratio of the DED specimen is 0.133, and the average effective stress ratio of the DED specimen after LSP decreases to 0.110, which decreases by 17.3%. The fatigue lives of the DED specimen before and after LSP are 62.7% and 105.2% of that of the hot-rolled plate. After LSP treatment, the fatigue life of the DED specimen is increased by about 1.68 times. The fracture morphology in the transient fracture zone changes from ductile and brittle mixed fracture to ductile fracture. Herein, the three-dimensional finite element model of directed energy deposition and a compact tensile specimen before and after laser shock peening are first established. Then, the stress field distribution of the specimens is obtained by a combination of experiments and simulations. Finally, the influence rules of residual stress on the stress intensity factor and effective stress ratio are quantified based on the contour integral method.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH	[Duan, Chenghong; Shang, Dazhi; Luo, Xiangpeng; Hao, Xiaojie; Cao, Xiankun] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China	Beijing University of Chemical Technology	Shang, DZ; Luo, XP (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.	2020400152@buct.edu.cn; xpluo@mail.buct.edu.cn			This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52235006), Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province (2022YFG0086), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB110020 [2022YFG0086]; Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [2016YFB1100202]; Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China;  [52235006]	This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52235006), Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province (2022YFG0086), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB110020; Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province; National Key Research and Development Program of China; 	This work was supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52235006), Key Research and Development Program of Sichuan Province (2022YFG0086), and the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFB1100202).		37	0	0	6	6	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1611-3683	1869-344X		STEEL RES INT	Steel Res.

Soluble Ruthenium Phthalocyanines as Semiconductors for Organic Thin-Film Transistors	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						Organic Thin-Film Transistor; Photo-Electrochemical Characterization; p-Type Organic Semiconductor; Ruthenium Phthalocyanine; Solution Processing	X-RAY REFLECTOMETRY; SILICON PHTHALOCYANINE; PERFORMANCE; OXYGEN; COMPLEXES; ELECTRON; TIN	Ruthenium phthalocyanine (RuPcs) are multipurpose compounds characterized by their remarkable reactivity and photoelectronic properties, which yield a broad synthetic scope and easy derivatization at the axial position. However, RuPcs have been underexplored for use in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), and therefore new studies are necessary to provide basic insight and a first approach in this new application. Herein, two novel RuPc derivatives, containing axial pyridine substituents with aliphatic chains (RuPc(CO)(PyrSiC6) (1) and RuPc(PyrSiC6)2 (2), were synthesized, characterized, and tested as the organic semiconductor in OTFTs. RuPc thin-films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to assess film morphology and microstructure. 1 displayed comparable p-type device performance to other phthalocyanine-based OTFTs of similar design, with an average field effect mobility of 2.08x10-3 cm2 V-1 s-1 in air and 1.36x10-3 cm2 V-1 s-1 in nitrogen, and threshold voltages from -11 V to -20 V. 2 was found to be non-functional as the semiconductor in the device architecture used, likely as a result of significant differences in thin-film formation. The results of this work illustrate a promising starting point for future development of RuPc electronic devices, particularly in this new family of OTFTs. Ruthenium phtalocyanines (RuPcs) possess distinct photoelectronic properties and a broad synthetic scope allowing for highly tuneable molecular designs, making them promising candidates as organic semiconductors in OTFTs. However, RuPcs have been underexplored in this field, and more studies are needed to provide basic insight into their potential. Herein, two novel RuPc derivatives were synthesized and implemented in OTFTs displaying p-type device operation.+image	[Garcia-Calvo, Jose; Torres, Tomas] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Organ Chem, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Calvo, Jose; Torres, Tomas] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Inst Adv Res Chem Sci IAdChem, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Calvo, Jose; Torres, Tomas] IMDEA Nanociencia, Campus Cantoblanco,C Faraday 9, Madrid 28049, Spain; [Cranston, Rosemary R.; Lessard, Benoit H.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, 161 Louis Pasteur, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Lopez-Duarte, Ismael] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Chem Pharmaceut Sci, Ciudad Univ,Ramon y Cajal Sq, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Lessard, Benoit H.] Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 800 King Edward Ave, Ottawa, ON, Canada	Autonomous University of Madrid; Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Ottawa; Complutense University of Madrid; University of Ottawa	Torres, T (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Organ Chem, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.; Torres, T (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Madrid, Inst Adv Res Chem Sci IAdChem, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.; Torres, T (corresponding author), IMDEA Nanociencia, Campus Cantoblanco,C Faraday 9, Madrid 28049, Spain.; Lessard, BH (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, 161 Louis Pasteur, Ottawa, ON, Canada.; Lessard, BH (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 800 King Edward Ave, Ottawa, ON, Canada.	tomas.torres@uam.es; benoit.lessard@uottawa.ca	; Lessard, Benoit/C-9098-2012; Torres, Tomas/H-9796-2014; Lopez-Duarte, Ismael/B-2806-2017	Cranston, Rosemary/0000-0001-6788-0186; Lessard, Benoit/0000-0002-9863-7039; Torres, Tomas/0000-0001-9335-6935; GARCIA CALVO, JOSE/0000-0002-1873-0293; Lopez-Duarte, Ismael/0000-0002-9941-8305	B.H.L and R.R.C would like to thank the Centre for Research in Photonics at the University of Ottawa (CRPuO) for access to the AFM.

Expert opinion on the identification, risk assessment, and mitigation of microorganisms and parasites relevant to xenotransplantation products from pigs	XENOTRANSPLANTATION			English	Article						xenotransplantation; risk management; risk assessment; porcine parasites; porcine microorganisms; pig; human health; hazard identification	MICROBIOLOGICAL SAFETY; INFECTION; DISEASE	Xenotransplantation has the potential to address shortages of organs available for clinical transplantation, but concerns exist regarding potential risks posed by porcine microorganisms and parasites (MP) to the health of human recipients. In this study, a risk-based framework was developed, and expert opinion was elicited to evaluate porcine MP based on swine exposure and risk to human health. Experts identified 255 MP to include in the risk assessment. These were rated by experts for five criteria regarding potential swine exposure in the USA and human health risks. MP were subsequently categorized into three risk mitigation groups according to pre-defined rules: disqualifying porcine MP (due to their pathogenic potential, n = 130); non-disqualifying porcine MP (still relevant to consider for biosecurity or monitoring efforts, n = 40); and alert/watch list (not reported in the USA or MP not in swine, n = 85). Most disqualifying (n = 126) and non-disqualifying (n = 36) porcine MP can effectively be eliminated with high biosecurity programs. This approach supports surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for porcine MP in swine produced for xenotransplantation, such as documentation of freedom from porcine MP, or use of porcine MP screening, monitoring, or elimination options. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first effort to comprehensively identify all relevant porcine MP systematically and transparently evaluate the risk of infection of both donor animals and immunosuppressed human recipients, and the potential health impacts for immunosuppressed human recipients from infected xenotransplantation products from pigs.

J	Guo, Z; Zhang, CQ; Cai, J; Feng, JJ				Guo, Zheng; Zhang, Changqing; Cai, Jun; Feng, Jinjun			Design of an ultrashort H-plane coupler without transition structure for sheet beam traveling-wave tube amplifier at W-band	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article						microwave devices; millimetre-wave couplers; ridge waveguides		An ultrashort H-plane sheet beam traveling-wave tube (SB-TWT) coupler without transition structure is proposed. The coupler adopts a new idea of directly coupling the microwave from H-plane of the slow-wave circuit (SWC) and optimizes the matching by introducing an asymmetric circular ridge on the E-plane of the coupled waveguide. As a result, the length of the SB-TWT coupler is reduced from more than 3 lambda to 1 lambda. At the same time, the beam tunnel area is enlarged to twice that of the SWC beam tunnel. In the working band (90-100 GHz) of the SWC, the simulation results show that the reflection is less than -25 dB, the isolation is greater than -22 dB. And the influence of the dimensions and locations of ridge on the performance of the coupler is studied. Particle-in-cell simulation results also show that the new coupler can not only complete the microwave coupling well but also reduce the number of SWC periods. An ultrashort H-plane coupler without transition structure for sheet beam travelling-wave tube(SB-TWT) amplifier at W-band is proposed. The coupler is simple, effective, and has a very short axial length, so it is expected to become the protagonist of the SB-TWT coupler in engineering applications.image	[Guo, Zheng; Zhang, Changqing; Cai, Jun; Feng, Jinjun] Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Vacuum Elect, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Zheng; Zhang, Changqing; Cai, Jun; Feng, Jinjun] Beijing Vacuum Elect Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China		Guo, Z; Feng, JJ (corresponding author), Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Vacuum Elect, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Guo, Z; Feng, JJ (corresponding author), Beijing Vacuum Elect Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.	guozheng12s@163.com; fengjinjun@tsinghua.org.cn		Guo, Zheng/0009-0002-7768-7165					9	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0013-5194	1350-911X		ELECTRON LETT	Electron.

J	Islam, R; Sultana, N				Islam, Rafiqul; Sultana, Nasrin			Efficacy of clove and tulsi supplementation in drinking water in broiler immunity	VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						bursa of Fabricius; medicinal plants; phytochemicals; spleen; thymus	ORGANS	Background: Medicinal plants or their products are popular substitutes for antibiotics or other synthetic growth promoters for their beneficial effects and cost-effectiveness. Clove (Cv) and tulsi (Ts) are rich in phytochemicals and are used to augment the growth performance of poultry. Objectives: The current investigation was carried out to evaluate the effects of Cv and Ts supplementation in drinking water on the morphologic and morphometric adaptations in the lymphoid organs. Methods: The experiment was conducted on 60 broiler chicks, divided into 4 homogenous groups (5 pens/group and 3 broilers/pen) named T0 (control), T1 (0.5% Cv and 2% Ts), T2 (1% Cv and 3% Ts) and T3 (1.5% Cv and 4% Ts). The treatments were administered from days 8 to 28. Lymphoid organs (thymus, spleen and bursa of Fabricius) were collected on days 14, 21 and 28 after sacrificing five broilers from each group. Results: The treatment groups had higher thymus and spleen weights on day 21, whereas the weights of the bursa of Fabriciuswere higher on days 14, 21 and 28. In the histomorphologic study, no noticeable difference in the histoarchitectures of the lymphoid organs was noticed. However, substantial differences in the cortico-medullary ratio and the number of follicles in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius, respectively, were found in the histomorphometric investigation. Conclusion: The inclusion of Cv and Ts in drinking water augments the weight of lymphoid organs with histomorphometric adaptations that might improve the immune status in broilers.

J	Kakodia, SK; Dyanamina, G				Kakodia, Sanjay Kumar; Dyanamina, Giribabu			Improved Federal Test Procedure (FTP75) driving cycle performance for PMSM-fed hybrid electric vehicles using artificial neural network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUIT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						hybrid electric vehicle; neural network controller; PMSM; speed estimation; vector control	SENSORLESS CONTROL; CONTROL-SYSTEM; MOTOR-DRIVES	The sensorless speed control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is gaining popularity in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications leading to its enhanced safety, reliability, and cost savings. Speed control using vector control for PMSM-fed HEV requires the speed encoder. When the speed sensor information fails, the inverter must ensure power delivery to the PMSM continuously by estimating the speed; this mode of operation is referred as limp-home mode in HEV. In this paper, a speed sensorless scheme has been proposed for PMSM-based HEV during limp-home mode operation. This paper presents a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) speed estimator based on an adaptive neural network controller (NNC) for speed estimation of PMSM. In the HEV application, in case of speed/position encoder failure, the speed of the PMSM can be estimated by stator flux using stator current.The proposed method employs stator currents in the reference model to eliminate the DC drift problem. Furthermore, the NNC is employed in the adaptation mechanism to improve the Federal Test Procedure (FTP75) driving cycle performance. The performance of the proposed control scheme has been validated with dSPACE 1104 R & D rapid development controller using vector control for the PMSM during variable speed and torque, including the zero-speed applications This paper presents a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) speed observer based on an adaptive neural network controller for speed estimation of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) fed hybrid electric vehicle. When the speed sensor information fails, the inverter present in the power train of the vehicle must continuously ensure power delivery to the PMSM by estimating the speed; this mode of operation is referred to as limp-home mode in EV. The proposed method employs stator currents in the reference model to eliminate the DC drift problem. The ANN-based stator current MRAS speed observer has been tested for different driving cycles, such as FTP75, Indian urban, Indian highway drive cycle, and staircase reference input. The proposed control scheme enhances the system's dynamic performance by achieving better control and accuracy in speed regulation at different driving cycles, which is verified by comparing standard deviations (SDs) and relative error of speed response. image	[Kakodia, Sanjay Kumar; Dyanamina, Giribabu] Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol Bhopal, Dept Elect Engn, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India	National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology Bhopal	Dyanamina, G (corresponding author), Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol Bhopal, Dept Elect Engn, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.	dgiribabu208@gmail.com	kakodia, SAnjay/GYQ-8426-2022	kakodia, SAnjay/0000-0001-7840-2884					29	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0098-9886	1097-007X		INT J CIRC THEOR APP	Int.

The current method cannot accurately reflect the stress condition of the insulator to find the stress concentration areas. To solve these problems, a method for detecting two-dimensional plane stress (& delta;1 and & delta;2) within different depth ranges in a basin-type insulator is proposed based on critically refracted longitudinal (LCR) wave. First, the acoustoelastic equation characterising the relationship between the variation of LCR wave propagation time and the plane stress was derived. Next, the propagation characteristics of LCR wave in epoxy resin samples were investigated. Then, the stress distribution within different depth ranges of the insulator subjected to hydraulic load was measured using the proposed method, including direction (& theta;), & delta;1 and & delta;2. The results show that the magnitude of the stress alone cannot accurately characterise the stress state. Points with equal distances to the centre have similar stress magnitudes, but their directions are not the same. With increasing depth, & theta; remains essentially unchanged at the same location, while & delta;1 and & delta;2 decrease, and the rate of decrease varies at different locations. Comparing the measured and simulated data, the results showed that they were in good agreement, and the maximum errors of stress value and & theta; were 0.69 MPa and 2.97 & DEG;, respectively, which confirmed the feasibility and accuracy of the stress detection in the proposed method.

The methodological complexity of integrating this trait implies it is ignored when developing tools to detect selective sweeps. But, as dormancy lengthens the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), increasing times to fixation, it can change the genomic signatures of selection. To detect genes under positive selection in seed banking species it is important to (1) determine whether the efficacy of selection is affected, and (2) predict the patterns of nucleotide diversity at and around positively selected alleles. We present the first tree sequence-based simulation program integrating a weak seed bank to examine the dynamics and genomic footprints of beneficial alleles in a finite population. We find that seed banking does not affect the probability of fixation and confirm expectations of increased times to fixation. We also confirm earlier findings that, for strong selection, the times to fixation are not scaled by the inbreeding effective population size in the presence of seed banks, but are shorter than would be expected. As seed banking increases the effective recombination rate, footprints of sweeps appear narrower around the selected sites and due to the scaling of the ARG are detectable for longer periods of time. The developed simulation tool can be used to predict the footprints of selection and draw statistical inference of past evolutionary events in plants, invertebrates, or fungi with seed banks.

The nanofluid is also taken into account in this model, along with impacts from Brownian motion and thermophoresis. The modified system governing partial differential equations is numerically solved by using the R-K method along with the shooting technique. Various values of physical quantities like thermophoresis parameter, Brownian motion parameter, Eckert number, thermal radiation parameter, heat source parameter, and magnetic field parameter along with the C-f, Nu(x), and Sh(x) were calculated using the temperature, concentration, and velocity profiles. Finally, we demonstrated how the Brownian motion, radiation, and thermophoresis parameters can significantly increase the temperature distributions. The concentration distributions were decelerated with an increase in Brownian motion parameters for both Blasius and Sakiadis cases.

For such a problem, the existing finite-time control approaches available are essentially only designed to ensure that the system state-variables converge within a certain time. Specifically how each state-variable converges is typically not considered in the design process. Along this line, the approach of time-synchronized design in this paper attains the more comprehensive and desirable outcome of having the marine vessels' state-variables arrive at the sliding mode surface in a fixed time. Also additionally, the state-variables converge at the same moment. This approach thus can attain synchronous tracking of the LNGC to the FLNG vessel. All these desirable properties and outcomes of control system convergence are rigorously proved in the work here via the methods of Lyapunov-type theorems and associated stability analysis. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the approaches developed here are suitably applicable in real-world engineering conditions (with system uncertainties and external disturbances), robustness extensions are also incorporated. In the presented work, the analytical issues and the methodologies in the designed control system solution under the conditions of the disturbed systems are discussed in detail. The numerical simulations conducted verify the merits of the proposed algorithm. Comparative numerical simulations on the developed scheme, and on traditional control, are carried out to demonstrate the important and improved outcomes attained with the time-synchronized features.

Similarities and differences in the NPSs between preclinical/prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) and prodromal Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD)/Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may exist. This study aimed to compare the NPSs between preclinical/prodromal AD and prodromal PDD/DLB.Methods: One hundred and three participants without dementia aged=50 years were included in this study. The mild behavioral impairment (MBI) total score and the MBI scores for each domain were calculated using the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire score. Participants were divided into five groups based on the clinical diagnosis by neurologists or psychiatrists in each institution based on the results of the amyloid positron emission tomography and dopamine transporter single photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT): Group 1: amyloid-positive and abnormal DAT-SPECT, Group 2: amyloid-negative and abnormal DAT-SPECT, Group 3: amyloid-positive and normal DAT-SPECT, Group 4: mild cognitive impairment unlikely due to AD with normal DAT-SPECT, and Group 5: cognitively normal with amyloid-negative and normal DAT-SPECT.Results: The MBI abnormal perception or thought content scores were significantly higher in Group 1 than Group 5 (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.012). The MBI total score (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.011) and MBI impulse dyscontrol score (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.033) in Group 4 were significantly higher than those in Group 5.Conclusion: The presence of both amyloid and putative Lewy body pathologies may be associated with psychotic symptoms.

Providing school nutrition professionals with professional development, improving the palatability of school meals, offering taste tests, pre-slicing fruit, providing recess before lunch, offering incentives for trying healthier options, and providing access to drinking water resulted in increased selection and consumption of healthier items. There were inconclusive or mixed findings for some intervention strategies including adequate seat time for meals.CONCLUSIONS: Despite demonstrated improvements to school meal programs and competitive foods, more work is needed to change the selection and consumption of healthier options among K-12 students. Schools can use multiple interventions to improve the school nutrition environment and services and help students adopt food and beverage choices that support health.

Therefore, this article introduces a new mechanistic VZ module coupled with an improved groundwater-balance (GWB) module to enhance the capabilities of the well-known Soil Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) model. The main improvements and features of the modified SWAT model (M-SWAT) include: a numerical VZ module to accurately simulate soil water-salt transport under variably saturated conditions by solving the head-formed Richards' equation and advection-dispersion equation; a GWB module (on a sub-basin scale for shallow aquifer) coupled with VZ module by proposing an effective way of boundary information exchanges; and a more reasonable water-salt stress functions (i.e., based on matric head and osmotic head) to calculate root water uptake and plant growth. The M-SWAT was then tested and evaluated with two-year observation data from the Yangchang canal command area (YCA, an experimental site) and the Jiyuan Irrigation System (Jiyuan, region-scale), located in the arid upper Yellow River basin of northwest China. The model produced a good agreement between the simulated and observed data in both calibration and validation with sufficiently small root mean square error (RMSE). The determination coefficient (R2) was greater than 0.51, 0.36, and 0.87 in simulating the soil water-salt dynamics, groundwater depth fluctuations, and leaf area index development, respectively. Case testing also proved that the M-SWAT had sufficient computational efficiency and stability for regional application. Further comparisons with previous studies indicated that the M-SWAT could more accurately and rationally simulate the soil water-salt dynamics and their interactions in arid watersheds with shallow groundwater tables.

Disclosed herein, a flexible multidentate proton-responsive ligand (L) bearing 2,6-bis(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridine (BBP), 6-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)picolinic acid (BPA), and benzene-1,2-diamine (BDA) for Co/Mn-based mono- and bi-metallic supramolecular materials for C-/N-alkylation of alcohols. The flexible binding sites and different hydrogen bond donor-acceptor fragments of L brings the rigidity and self-assembling to ordered crystalline supramolecular materials, which prevented the coordinatively saturated active sites and thus providing much higher reaction efficiency and selectivity, which is highly unlikely in the case of comparable individual components. The easy synthesis, efficient reactivity and selectivity through cooperativity, broad substrate scope, and efficient recycling via recharging of metals make the catalyst and the protocol economical and sustainable. Importantly, the design strategy based on metallo-organic hydrogen bonded coordination assembly has the potential to contribute to the development of supramolecular materials for various advanced catalytic applications.

Enhancing vinyl ester properties with eco-friendly sustainable biochar filler	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article; Early Access						mechanical properties; polymer composites; SEM analysis; sustainable biochar	WASTE	Biomass and other biogenic wastes can be used in polymeric materials, allowing for effective waste utilization. Thus, these materials can be converted into biochar and used in composite fabrication. Biochar was used in the current study to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of vinyl ester-based composites. Waste cashew nut shells were converted into biochar via a slow pyrolysis method. Biochar was added at three different levels (5, 10 and 15 wt.%). Composite with 10 wt.% biochar showed ca.72% and ca.54% higher tensile strength and hardness than the neat vinyl ester. The composite containing 15 wt.% biochar showed the highest impact and flexural strength of ca.47 MPa and ca.13 kJ/m2 respectively. The thermo-gravimetric study showed that the composites with 15 wt.% added biochar performed better than the others, with a yield percentage of ca.45%. This study provides a summary of biochar applications and highlights the advantages of biomass wastes with respect to energy and environmental sustainability for the production of strong and thermally stable composites.

Due to their role in attenuating the signal-initiating potency of RTKs, RPTPs have long been viewed as therapeutic targets. However, the development of activators of RPTPs has remained limited. We previously reported that the homodimerization of a representative member of the RPTP family (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor J or PTPRJ) is regulated by specific transmembrane (TM) residues. Disrupting this interaction by single point mutations promotes PTPRJ access to its RTK substrates (e.g., EGFR and FLT3), reduces RTK's phosphorylation and downstream signaling, and ultimately antagonizes RTK-driven cell phenotypes. Here, we designed and tested a series of first-in-class pH-responsive TM peptide agonists of PTPRJ that are soluble in aqueous solution but insert as a helical TM domain in lipid membranes when the pH is lowered to match that of the acidic microenvironment of tumors. The most promising peptide reduced EGFR's phosphorylation and inhibited cancer cell EGFR-driven migration and proliferation, similar to the PTPRJ's TM point mutations. Developing tumor-selective and TM-targeting peptide binders of critical RPTPs could afford a potentially transformative approach to studying RPTP's selectivity mechanism without requiring less specific inhibitors and represent a novel class of therapeutics against RTK-driven cancers.

The prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) is hypothesized to play an important role in driving disease aggressiveness, but precise mechanisms remain elusive. In our study, we used spatial transcriptomics to explore for the first time the spatial gene expression heterogeneity within primary prostate tumors from patients with metastatic disease. In total, we analyzed 5459 tissue spots from three PCa patients comprising castration-resistant (CRPC) and neuroendocrine (NEPC) disease stages. Within CRPC, we identified a T cell cluster whose activity might be impaired by nearby regulatory T cells, potentially mediating the aggressive disease phenotype. Moreover, we identified Hallmark signatures of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in a cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) cluster, indicating the aggressive characteristic of the primary TME leading to metastatic dissemination. Within NEPC, we identified active immune-stroma cross-talk exemplified by significant ligand-receptor interactions between CAFs and M2 macrophages. Further, we identified a malignant cell population that was associated with the down-regulation of an immune-related gene signature. Lower expression of this signature was associated with higher levels of genomic instability in advanced PCa patients (SU2C cohort, n = 99) and poor recurrence free survival in early-stage PCa patients (TCGA cohort, n = 395), suggesting prognostic biomarker potential. Taken together, our study reveals the importance of whole transcriptome profiling at spatial resolution for biomarker discovery and for advancing our understanding of tumor biology.

Noninvasive imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography, can play a crucial role in the early detection and diagnosis of this unusual presentation. Timely administration of anthelmintic therapy led to the resolution of symptoms and prevented the need for invasive procedures. Healthcare providers should be vigilant about the diverse clinical manifestations of ascariasis, and regular deworming programs and health education are essential in minimizing the burden of this neglected tropical disease among children.AbstractAscariasis is a common public health problem globally but it is more prevalent in school-age children and it often goes undiagnosed, leading to severe complications. The purpose of this report is to spread awareness of its unusual presentation and how to judiciously use noninvasive approaches for its diagnosis. We present a case of a 10-year-old girl that was presented in pediatric emergency with gradually worsening epigastric pain. Initial lab work-up showed elevated pancreatic enzymes which lead to the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The patient was managed in the line of acute pancreatitis and with further evaluation by imaging techniques such as ultrasound and CT-scan abdomen, Ascaris lumbricoides (A. lumbricoides) was visualized. She was then treated with prophylactic antibiotics and antiparasitic medications, which resolved her symptoms and the child responded to the treatment. In children, parasites should be considered as a cause of acute pancreatitis by clinicians, especially in low-income countries, and before performing invasive procedures, noninvasive approaches should be considered as an initial option. This can save the patient from multiple invasive procedure and its severe complications. image	[Samir, Komal; Subash, Arun; Shah, Hussain Haider] Dow Univ Hlth Sci, Karachi, Pakistan; [Subash, Tushar] Aga Khan Univ, Karachi, Pakistan; [Bilal, Hammad] Baqai Med Univ, Karachi, Pakistan; [Dave, Tirth] Bukovinian State Med Univ, Chernovtsy, Ukraine	Dow University of Health Sciences; Aga Khan University; Baqai Medical University; Bukovinian State Medical University	Dave, T (corresponding author), Bukovinian State Med Univ, Chernovtsy, Ukraine.	tirth.snehal.dave@gmail.com	Dave, Tirth/HCI-4105-2022	Dave, Tirth/0000-0001-7935-7333; Shah, Hussain Haider/0000-0002-8032-7462	The authors are very appreciative to the patient for the opportunity to learn as well as thankful to the hospital for providing support for completing this report.

Data were collected from January to March 2021 using observation, interview and document analysis methods. Data were examined using thematic analysis.Results: Participants included APNs (n = 5), nurses/allied health providers (n = 5), physicians (n = 5), managers (n = 4) and decision-makers (n = 4). Stakeholder engagement and leadership provided by decision-makers, managers, physicians and APNs facilitated role implementation. Poor stakeholder role understanding, uncertain role funding, and the COVID-19 pandemic hindered role implementation. APNs spent the most time in clinical activities. Participants perceived the integration of APNs within the healthcare team and their impact on patient care to be positive.Conclusion: Stakeholder engagement and organizational and APN leadership facilitated the implementation of the roles, especially related to team-based patient care. Further efforts are needed to strengthen APN involvement in non-clinical activities and address role barriers.

The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge and attitudes of students of Iranian medical sciences universities about this subject, which could have a great impact on the future of this industry in Iran.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the students of medical sciences universities in Iran were selected through convenience sampling; they filled out an online 36-item self-administrated questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 25). Descriptive statistics of knowledge and attitude were provided. Also, independent samples t-test and analysis of variance were used as statistical tests and p value < 0.05 was considered as the significant level.Results: Overall, 390 students with a mean age of 24 & PLUSMN; 1.5 years and a female-to-male ratio of 1.9 participated in this study. The respondents answered 38% of the questions correctly in the knowledge section. Age, ethnicity, education level, job experience, experience of a health tourism-related job, participation in health tourism courses, and geographical region of the province of residence showed a significant association with the participants' knowledge. Also, most participants had an almost positive attitude regarding the potential for development of the industry.Conclusion: According to the results obtained, the students' knowledge about health tourism was not desirable; however, their attitudes were almost positive. Therefore, educational interventions are highly recommended to be conducted in this regard.

We aimed to investigate whether microRNA modulation could be an underlying mechanism in the a7nAchR downregulation in mouse hypothalamus following a short-term exposure to an obesogenic diet. Bioinformatic analysis revealed Let-7 microRNAs as candidates to regulate Chrna7, which was confirmed by the luciferase assay. Mice exposed to an obesogenic diet for 3 days had increased Let-7a and decreased a7nAChR levels, accompanied by hypothalamic fatty acids and TNFa content. Hypothalamic neuronal cells exposed to fatty acids presented higher Let-7a and TNFa levels and lower Chrna7 expression, but when the cells were pre-treated with TLR4 inhibitor, Let-7a, TNFa, and Chrna7 were rescued to normal levels. Thus, the fatty acids overload trigger TNFa-induced Let-7 overexpression in hypothalamic neuronal cells, which negatively regulates a7nAChR, an event that can be related to hyperphagia and obesity predisposition in mice.

Appendicitis and its associated mortality and morbidity in infants up to 3 months of age: A systematic review	HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS			English	Review						appendicitis; infants; morbidity; mortality; neonates; newborns	NEONATAL ACUTE APPENDICITIS; AMYANDS HERNIA; PERFORATED APPENDICITIS; LAPAROSCOPIC APPENDECTOMY; CHILDREN; DIAGNOSIS; PRESENTATIONS; COMPLICATION; PRETERM; RISK	Background and AimsAlthough appendicitis is rare in young infants, the reported mortality is high. Primary aim of this systematic review was to provide updated insights in the mortality and morbidity (postoperative complications, Clavien-Dindo grades I-IV) of appendicitis in infants & LE;3 months of age. Secondary aims comprised the evaluation of patient characteristics, diagnostic work-up, treatment strategies, comorbidity, and factors associated with poor outcome.MethodsThis systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA statement with a search performed in Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science (up to September 5th 2022). Original articles (published in English & GE;1980) reporting on infants & LE;3 months of age with appendicitis were included. Both patients with abdominal appendicitis and herniated appendicitis (such as Amyand's hernia) were considered. Data were provided descriptively.ResultsIn total, 131 articles were included encompassing 242 cases after identification of 4294 records. Overall, 184 (76%) of the 242 patients had abdominal and 58 (24%) had herniated appendicitis. Two-hundred (83%) of the patients were newborns (& LE;28 days) and 42 (17%) were infants between 29 days and & LE;3 months of age. Either immediate, or after initial conservative treatment, 236 (98%) patients underwent surgical treatment. Some 168 (69%) patients had perforated appendicitis. Mortality was reported in 20 (8%) patients and morbidity in an additional 18 (8%). All fatal cases had abdominal appendicitis and fatal outcome was relatively more often reported in newborns, term patients, patients with relevant comorbidity, nonperforated appendicitis and those presented from home.ConclusionMortality was reported in 20 (8%) infants & LE;3 months of age and additional morbidity in 18 (8%). All patients with fatal outcome had abdominal appendicitis. Several patient characteristics were relatively more often reported in infants with poor outcome and adequate monitoring, early recognition and prompt treatment may favour the outcome.

We investigated the variations and geographic patterns of the range size of 9898 angiosperm species endemic to China and compared the effects of historical and contemporary climate and species' functional traits associated with dispersal ability (including growth form, fruit type, and sexual system) on range size variations. Our results revealed that narrow-ranged endemic species are clustered in Southwest China where angiosperm species' richness peaks. Winter temperature had the strongest and negative effect on the range size of narrow-ranged endemic species across space and species, while climate seasonality had the strongest and positive effect on the range size of wide-ranged endemic species. Both historical and contemporary climate have also influenced species range size indirectly via their effects on species' functional traits associated with dispersal ability. Range size of all endemic species, narrow-ranged and wide-ranged, showed little phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic conservatism plays a minor role in range size variations. Our results show that the range size of angiosperm species endemic to China is driven by both extrinsic spatiotemporal environmental factors and intrinsic species' traits that allow species to cope with environmental change.

However, state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as deep learning do not express uncertainty of their predictions. Especially in cases where appliances are confused, it is desirable that an NILM system can suggest multiple possible predictions to the end-user, including its confidence and credibility of any given prediction. This can be achieved using conformal prediction, being an effective way to quantify uncertainty of a given machine learning model. In this work, conformal prediction is introduced for NILM and applied to a neural network. The approach is explained and supported by several examples. Conformal prediction in Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) can be used to express uncertainty for appliance identification when making use of deep learning. The study shows how conformal prediction can suggest multiple possible predictions to the end-user, along with confidence and credibility. The approach is applied to a neural network and supported by various examples.image	[Werthen-Brabants, Lorin; Dhaene, Tom; Deschrijver, Dirk] Univ Ghent, Imec, IDLab, Ghent, Belgium	IMEC; Ghent University	Werthen-Brabants, L (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Imec, IDLab, Ghent, Belgium.	lorin.werthenbrabants@ugent.be			Flemish Government	Flemish Government	This research received funding from the Flemish Government under the "Onderzoeksprogramma Artificiele Intelligentie (AI) Vlaanderen" programme.		23	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0013-5194	1350-911X		ELECTRON LETT	Electron.

Methods: We selected 60 pregnant women at the Fourth Hospital of Baotou between January 2019 and July 2021. These women were divided into three distinct groups: the preterm PROM group with 20 cases, term PROM (TPROM) group with 20 cases, and a control group with 20 cases consisting of normal full-term pregnancies without PROM. Peripheral blood was collected from all participants. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the levels of IL-1 and IL-18 in the plasma were assessed. Additionally, the proportions of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase-1-positive macrophages were also evaluated. Results: The ratios of NLRP3, ASC, IL-1 beta, and IL-18 concentrations, along with the presence of caspase-1-positive macrophages, were notably greater in the PROM groups in comparison with the control group (p <.05). In the TPROM group and control group, the proportions of IL-1 beta and IL-18 levels were found to be lower than NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1-positive macrophages levels (p <.05). Conclusion: The concentrations of IL-1 beta and IL-18, as well as the ratios of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1-positive macrophages, were elevated in patients with PROM compared to the control group. This suggests a potential correlation between the excessive activation of NLRP3 and the development of PROM.

Hydroxyl groups are selected as trap groups and introduced into benzylamine hydrochloride of Cd-based perovskite. The resulting two-dimensional (2D) perovskite (C7H10NO)2CdCl4 & BULL;H2O (H1) exhibits blue fluorescence at 405 nm and green phosphorescence at 482 nm under 365 nm excitation. After introducing guest Mn2+, due to the passivation of defects, the doped H1 (H1-M) achieves orange phosphorescence (& lambda; = 615 nm) of Cd2+. Interestingly, because thermal stimulation induces the coordination of hydroxyl groups with metal ions, H1 and H1-M are transformed into the zero-dimensional (0D) perovskite (C7H10NO)2CdCl4 (H2) and doped H2 (H2-M), respectively. The coordination immobilizes the organic molecules, thus resulting in a large increase in the phosphorescence lifetime and a strong green afterglow of H2. The coordination also transforms the luminescent center of the doped perovskite from the host metal ion of H1-M to the guest metal ion of H2-M, achieving red phosphorescence of Mn2+ at 685 nm. Under water vapor, H2 and H2-M are reversibly converted to H1 and H1-M, respectively. Based on the above phenomena, a multilevel anti-counterfeit encryption system with water/heat stimulus-response is developed, which provides a new idea for the design of stimulus-responsive phosphorescent intelligent materials. Under external stimulation, perovskites with trap groups can induce coordination between ligands and metal ions, thus leading to a structure transition from 2D to 0D and luminescence centers altering from the host metal ions to the guest ones.image	[Yang, Xinxin; Wang, Shuaiqi; Wu, Junyan; Hu, Wei; Huang, Limei; Ling, Qidan; Lin, Zhenghuan] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Fujian Key Lab Polymer Mat, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China	Fujian Normal University	Huang, LM; Lin, ZH (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Fujian Key Lab Polymer Mat, Fuzhou 350007, Peoples R China.	lmhuang@fjnu.edu.cn; zhlin@fjnu.edu.cn	Lin, Zhenghuan/K-2594-2013	Lin, Zhenghuan/0000-0002-3900-563X	X.Y. and S.W. contributed equally to this work.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was responsible for cellular processes and played a crucial role in the cell function. ER stress is a complex and dynamic process that can induce abnormal apoptosis and death. However, the underlying mechanism of ER stress involved in TNBC is not well defined.Methods: We identified ubiquitin-specific protease 19 (USP19) as a TNBC negative regulator for further investigation. The effects of USP19 on BC proliferation were assessed in vitro using proliferation test and cell-cycle assays, while the effects in vivo were examined using a mouse tumorigenicity model. Through in vitro flow cytometric analyses and in vivo TUNEL assays, cell apoptosis was assessed. Proteomics was used to examine the proteins that interact with USP19.Results: Multiple in vitro and in vivo tests showed that USP19 decreases TNBC cell growth while increasing apoptosis. Then, we demonstrated that USP19 interacts with deubiquitinates and subsequently stabilises family molecular chaperone regulator 6 (BAG6). BAG6 can boost B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) ubiquitination and degradation, thereby raising ER calcium (Ca2+) levels and causing ER stress. We also found that the N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) "writer" methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) increased global m(6)A modification.Conclusions: Our study reveals that USP19 elevates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to alter ER stress via regulation of BAG6 and BCL2 stability and may be a viable therapeutic target for TNBC therapy.

Reducing opioid prescribing after ambulatory breast reconstruction surgery	JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						breast reconstruction; opioids; ostoperative pain; quality improvement	POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; ANALGESICS; MANAGEMENT; PRESCRIPTIONS; ABUSE	BackgroundThe lack of evidence-based guidelines for postoperative opioid prescriptions following breast reconstruction contributes to a wide variation in prescribing practices and increases potential for misuse and abuse.MethodsBetween August and December 2019, women who underwent outpatient breast reconstruction were surveyed 7-10 days before (n = 97) and after (n = 101) implementing a standardized opioid prescription reduction initiative. We compared postoperative opioid use, pain control, and refills in both groups. Patient reported outcomes were compared using the BREAST-Q physical wellbeing of the chest domain and a novel symptom Recovery Tracker.ResultsBefore changes in prescriptions, patients were prescribed a median of 30 pills and consumed three pills (interquartile range [IQR: 1,9]). After standardization, patients were prescribed eight pills and consumed three pills (IQR: 1,6). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of patients experiencing moderate to very severe pain on the Recovery Tracker or in the early BREAST-Q physical wellbeing of the chest scores (p = 0.8 and 0.3, respectively).ConclusionStandardizing and reducing opioid prescriptions for patients undergoing reconstructive breast surgery is feasible and can significantly decrease the number of excess pills prescribed. The was no adverse impact on early physical wellbeing, although larger studies are needed to obtain further data.

Retrieved data included signalment, history, clinical variables, surgical aspects, postoperative complications, and short- and long-term outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with short-term survival (p < .05).Results: Manual reduction was attempted in a third of the cases (32/98, 33%) and emergency surgery to reduce the hernia was performed in 64 of 98 (65%) cases. Concurrent small intestinal (SI) volvulus was identified in 26 (26/98, 27%) cases. Castration was the most common technique used to prevent recurrence (64/94, 68%). Overall AIH recurrence rate was 11% (11/98). A total of 59 (59/98, 60%) cases survived to hospital discharge and 49 of 52 (94%) cases were still alive after 12 months. Cases admitted within 10 h of colic signs had increased odds of survival (72%) compared to those admitted after 10 h (26%; p < .001). Draft breeds (p = .021), high heart rate on admission (p = .001) and concurrent SI volvulus (p = .048) were associated with reduced survival to hospital discharge.Conclusions: Horses with AIH had a higher risk of concurrent SI volvulus and lower survival than reported. Draft breeds, high heart rate on admission and concurrent SI volvulus were associated with reduced short-term survival.Clinical significance: The results of this study should help in prognostication for horses with AIH.

The spleen is the largest lymphatic organ that is adversely impacted during irradiation. The current study was designated to evaluate the possible anti-inflammatory effect of matcha-silver nanoparticles (M-AgNPs) to reduce inflammation associated with & gamma;-radiation induced-oxidative stress and inflammation in rats' spleen. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized by biogenic synthesis using a green sonochemical method from matcha (M) green tea. The obtained M-AgNPs were extensively characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Using zetasizer analysis, the surface charge, particle size, and radical scavenging DPPH assay of M-AgNPs were also examined. Biocompatibility and cytotoxicity were analyzed by MTT assay, and the IC50 was calculated. Four groups of 24 Wistar rats each had an equal number of animals. The next step involved measuring the levels of oxidative stress markers in the rat splenic tissue. Additionally, the amounts of inflammatory protein expression were evaluated using the ELISA analysis. The results indicated the formation of spherical nanoparticles of pure Ag & DEG; coated with matcha polyphenols at the nanoscale, as well as uniform monodisperse particles suited for cellular absorption. Results revealed that M-AgNPs improved all biochemical parameters. Furthermore, M-AgNPs relieve inflammation by reducing the expression of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), interleukin-1 & beta; (IL-1 & beta;), and enhancing the levels of ileSnt information regulator 1 (SIRT1). Histopathological examinations demonstrated the ability of M-AgNPs to overcome the damage consequent to irradiation and recover the spleen's cellular structure. These results confirmed that matcha is a potential biomaterial for synthesizing AgNPs, which can be exploited for their anti-inflammatory activity. This study is significant as it explores the biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using matcha green tea and their potential anti-inflammatory activity in reducing inflammation associated with irradiation-induced oxidative stress. The study provides a detailed characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles using various techniques. The results of the study show that M-AgNPs improved all biochemical parameters and reduced the expression of inflammatory markers while enhancing the levels of SIRT1. The study also demonstrated the ability of M-AgNPs to recover the spleen's cellular structure after irradiation-induced damage. These findings suggest that matcha could be a potential biomaterial for synthesizing AgNPs with anti-inflammatory properties for treating inflammation-associated disorders.

We herein investigated the clinical course and long -term outcomes of gastric cancer with oligometastasis in the real world setting to determine the opti-mal therapeutic strategy.Methods: The present study retrospectively analyzed 992 patients who received any treatment for metastatic or recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma at Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital between 2007 and 2019. Oligometastasis was defined as any one of the following: liver metastases (HEP) <3; lung metastases (PUL) <3; unilateral adrenal gland metastasis (ADR); para-aortic lymph node metastasis (PALN); or one, distant, lymph node metastasis, excluding the regional lymph nodes (LYM). Overall survival was compared by the characteristics and treatments for the oligometastasis, and univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the prognostic factors of overall survival.Results: Ninety- seven patients (9.8%) with the following metastasis sites were enrolled: HEP (n = 27), PUL (n = 2), ADR (n = 3), PALN (n = 55), and LYM (n = 10). The median survival time of the cohort was 22.8 months, and the five- year overall survival rate was 28.4%. On multivariate analysis, chemotherapy for the initial treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.438; p = 0.048), distal gastrectomy and/or metastasectomy (HR: 0.290; p = 0.001), and R0 resection (HR: 0.373; p = 0.005) were identified as independent, positive factors of overall survival.Conclusion: The long -term outcomes of gastric cancer in patients with oligometastasis may improve if treatment is begun with chemotherapy rather than surgery.

Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the SAFE score in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma; liver fibrosis; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis	SIMPLE NONINVASIVE INDEX; SIGNIFICANT FIBROSIS; STEATOHEPATITIS; VALIDATION; CIRRHOSIS; PREDICT; SYSTEM; FIB-4; NAFLD	Background & Aims The steatosis-associated fibrosis estimator (SAFE) score was developed to detect clinically significant liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD in the United States. We compare the performance of the SAFE score and other non-invasive tests to diagnose liver fibrosis and to correlate the scores with liver-related outcomes in patients with NAFLD in Hong Kong.Methods This was a retrospective cohort study involving two data sets. The first cohort was a biopsy cohort of NAFLD patients (n = 279), and the second was a territory-wide cohort of NAFLD patients (n = 4603) retrieved from a territory-wide electronic healthcare database in Hong Kong.Results In detecting significant fibrosis, liver stiffness measured by transient elastography had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (.844), followed by SAFE score (.773). SAFE score had the highest AUROC among blood-based algorithms (.773 vs. .746 for FIB-4, .697 for APRI). Based on cut-off values of SAFE score (0 and 100 points), 854 (18.6%), 1596 (34.6%) and 2153 (46.8%) were in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, respectively, in the territory-wide cohort. Six (.7%), 15 (.9%) and 59 (2.7%) developed liver-related events in those three groups respectively. Among patients who had liver-related events at 5 years, using the high cut-off, SAFE score could predict 84.9% of patients accurately, compared to 40.9% for FIB-4 and 27.2% for APRI.Conclusion The SAFE score performed well and better than other blood-based markers in diagnosing significant fibrosis and predicting liver-related events in Asian patients with NAFLD.

This article introduces a novel concept involving an efficient adapted structure model, which includes a bridge structure with two "nested" small and large pore systems, and an effective electrode conduction mechanism involving two "nested" percolation systems. The article also highlights a limitation in the improvement of the battery performance by percolation systems for electron transfer, which is restricted by pore systems for ion transfer through the ratio of electrical conductivity (s) and ionic conductivity (?) as s/? = 10. The findings of this article may provide valuable insight for formulation design and manufacturing of an optimal structure of the conductive binder domain for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.

The prepared adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The impact of variables, including pH, adsorbing dosage, contact time, and temperature on the removal percentages of RV5 and RB171 dyes were simultaneously investigated using response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design. The maximum removal efficiency (77.67 %) was obtained at a pH of 3, an adsorbent dosage of 0.3 g, a contact time of 15 min, and a temperature of 10 & DEG;C. The adsorption process fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm model with a coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.9996 and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R-2=0.9988). Hence, it could be concluded that the process of adsorption mechanism is monolayer and chemical. The maximum adsorption capacity (q(max)) was 50.25 mg g(-1). In conclusion, nZVI-CS-Cu can be considered as an efficient and inexpensive adsorbent for dye removal from aqueous solutions, because its separation is quick and easy, it possesses high efficiency, and there is no secondary pollution.

Pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of BMS-986263, a lipid nanoparticle containing HSP47 siRNA, in participants with hepatic impairment	CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access							LIVER-CIRRHOSIS	BMS-986263 is a retinoid-conjugated lipid nanoparticle delivering small interfering RNA designed to inhibit synthesis of HSP47 protein, a collagen-specific chaperone protein involved in fibrosis development. This is a phase I, open-label, two-part study evaluating pharmacokinetics and safety of BMS-986263 in participants with hepatic impairment (HI). Part 1 (n = 24) of this study enrolled two cohorts with mild and moderate HI and a separate cohort of age-and body mass index (BMI)-matched participants with normal hepatic function. Part 2 enrolled eight participants with severe HI and eight age-and BMI-matched participants with normal hepatic function. All participants received a single intravenous 90 mg BMS-986263 infusion. Compared with normal-matched participants, geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC((0-T))) and AUC from zero to infinity (AUC((INF))) of HSP47 siRNA were similar in participants with mild HI and 34% and 163% greater in those with moderate and severe HI, respectively, whereas the maximum plasma concentration was similar to 25% lower in mild and moderate HI groups but 58% higher in the severe HI group than in the normal group. Adverse events were reported by two of eight, four of eight, and three of eight participants with mild, moderate, or severe HI, respectively; none were reported in the normal-matched group. Overall, single-dose BMS-986263 was generally safe and well-tolerated and dose adjustment is not considered necessary for participants with mild or moderate HI. Although available data do not indicate that dose adjustment should be performed in patients with severe HI; the optimal posology of BMS-986263 in patients with severe HI may be determined later in its clinical development when additional data to establish exposure-safety/efficacy relationship becomes available. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Hepatic impairment (HI) study is usually not needed for small interfering RNA (siRNA) and oligonucleotide therapeutics because these therapeutics are typically eliminated from the body by nuclease-mediated degradation. However, for therapeutics that target the liver, HI studies may be required, regardless of the modality. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? BMS-986263 is an siRNA that inhibits the expression of HSP47. BMS-986263 targets hepatic stellate cell in the liver and is being developed for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The current study investigated the effect of varying degrees of HI on the disposition of BMS-986263. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? Impaired hepatic function may change the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of siRNA therapeutics, and the excipients of the delivery system. The totality of the safety, efficacy, and exposure data should be considered to make appropriate dose adjustment for BMS-986263 in participants with HI. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? A full study design to characterize the effect of various degrees of HI on the PKs of a liver-directed siRNA during early development can inform on inclusion of participants with HI during clinical development.

Herein, a flexible biomimetic ANS with multimode fuzzy perception and brain-like cognition is developed, by fusing the ion migration-modulated MXene synapse and machine learning (ML). First of all, the elementary perceptual ability to mimic biological neuroreceptors is demonstrated. Motion artifact in the ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) current is eliminated. Furthermore, the multimode perception and brain-like cognition are accomplished by synaptic currents (SCs) and nine ML algorithms. Finally, the cognitions of materials, gestures, and motions are conducted by distributing the ANS devices across body joints, and with the optimal ML method, the accuracies can reach 80%, 100%, and 90%, respectively. This synapse-based ANS may provide a new idea for developing next-generation neuromorphic intelligent robots.

This study examines Patagonia's supply chain practices through a social-symbolic work lens. It describes the intentional material work related to Patagonia's inputs, throughputs, and outputs, and also its complementary relational and discursive work. We argue that Patagonia's relational and discursive work are crucial to understanding how Patagonia (a) pursues sustainable supply chain practices, (b) influences its stakeholders to support sustainability, and (c) has positive spillover effects beyond its primary stakeholders. Incorporating a social-symbolic work lens draws attention to important theoretical and managerial insights-in particular, the need for a holistic rather than reductionist approach and the merit in creating self-reinforcing positive feedback loops-which are prone to be overlooked in conventional studies of sustainable supply chain management.

Current ECDs are limited by simultaneous changes in IR emissivity and VIS colors when subjected to external potential, restricting their potential applications. This work presents, for the first time, VIS-IR compatible ECDs capable of displaying VIS multicolor and dynamically modulating IR emissivity via a Ge/HfO2 Fabry-Perot cavity structure. The all-solid-state VIS-IR compatible ECD with the structure of ITO/NiO/Ta2O5/Li/WO3/ITO/Ge/HfO2 achieves not only emissivity modulation of 0.20 at potentials of -2.5 V and +2.5 V in the wavelength range of 2.5-25 mu m, but also, due to the presence of Fabry-Perot cavity, the novelty compatible device structure achieves static multicolor modulation, thus decoupling VIS and IR emissivity modulation. Additionally, a flexible VIS-IR compatible ECD based on polyaniline is also constructed. This novel approach offers a promising possibility for multispectral compatible manipulation, VIS multicolor, and IR signal processing applications.

The mechanism of the low-temperature water gas shift reaction (LTWGS) on an Au/CeO2 catalyst was investigated by means of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. Under steady-state LTWGS reaction (373-623 K), the catalyst is partially reduced, and signals from carbonate/formate dominates the infrared spectra. Time-resolved pulse of CO experiment under a constant partial pressure of water at 423 K indicates that Ce4+ can be reduced to Ce3+ and that formate (HCOO) species cannot be directly related to the CO2 production. Further information was obtained by performing modulation excitation spectroscopy (MES) experiments coupled with a phase-sensitive detection (PSD) method. Under periodic modulation of the CO partial pressure while keeping the H2O concentration constant, most of the intense bands of carbonate and formate remained constant, indicating that these species are only spectators. The same is observed for the concentration of Ce3+. Conversely, signals in-phase with the conversion of CO to CO2 are observed and assigned to carboxyl [C(O)OH] and carboxylate (CO(2)d-) species, while some monodentate formate (m-HCOO) also changes but at a lower rate. A plausible associative reaction mechanism where carboxyl/carboxylate are key intermediates is postulated.

Primary outcomes were large for gestational age (LGA) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission rates. An independent observational cohort of 1451 women was examined for measures of beta-cell function (ISSI-2, insulinogenic index/HOMA-IR) and insulin sensitivity/resistance (Matsuda index, HOMA-IR) by similar maternal glucose profiles.Results: Pregnancies with elevated FPG, either isolated or combined, had higher adverse events and lower insulin sensitivity. The combination of elevated FPG + elevated 1-h and/or 2-h PLG had the highest rates of LGA(20.9%), NICU admissions (14.7%), and lowest insulin sensitivity as measured by Matsuda index and HOMA-IR, and beta-cell function as measured by ISSI-2 and Insulinogenic index/HOMA-IR.Conclusions: Elevated fasting plasma glucose, either alone or combined with post-load glucose elevation is associated with worse outcomes than isolated post-load glucose elevation, possibly due to higher degrees of insulin resistance. Future work is needed to better understand these differences, and explore whether tailored treatment of GDM can improve neonatal outcomes.

Unfortunately, high catalytic activity ferrous (Fe2+)-based therapeutic agent has remained challenging due to the instability of Fe2+. Herein, an X-ray-activated Fe2+ supply platform, termed "PFCN", containing the core of CaWO4 nanoscintillator to emit ultraviolet (UV) light and Fe3O4 decorated on the surface to deliver excessive Fe2+ is proposed. Under X-ray excitation, the UV light emitted by CaWO4 can catalyze ferric (Fe3+) to generate Fe2+, which further cascades the Fenton reaction to induce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals generation. More importantly, immunogenic cell death-associated immunotherapy is simultaneously triggered during this process. Experiments conducted in vitro and in vivo revealed that X-ray-triggered PFCN shows superior tumor therapeutic efficacy, contributing i) enhanced radiotherapy; ii) X-ray-activated ferroptosis therapy; and iii) ferroptosis/radiotherapy-induced immunotherapy. Besides, PFCN can be utilized as an MR/CT dual-mode imaging contrast agent for tumor diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The study provides a novel example of an X-ray-activated ferrous-regeneration platform for imaging-guided augmenting tumor ferroptosis/immunotherapy	[Zhang, Caiju; Lu, Shuting; Deng, Kai; Liu, Yue; Suo, Ruiyang; Xu, Haibo; Wu, Bo] Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Radiol, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Caiju] Hainan Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Haikou 570311, Peoples R China; [Qian, Wang] Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Radiat & Med Oncol, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China; [Li, Yi; Jin, Shiqi] Hubei Univ, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China	Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Hubei University	Xu, HB; Wu, B (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Zhongnan Hosp, Dept Radiol, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China.	xuhaibo@whu.edu.cn; wubo5317@whu.edu.cn			This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82171922), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2021CFB055), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, 2019 Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical [2021CFB055]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [2042018kf0245]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [PTXM2022035]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical Talents Program [2020BCB030]; Medical Sci-Tech Innovation Platform of Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University [ZNJC201911]; Key Ramp;amp;D Program of Hubei Province; Translational Medicine and Interdisciplinary Research Joint Fund of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University;  [82171922]	This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82171922), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2021CFB055), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, 2019 Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical Talents Program; Medical Sci-Tech Innovation Platform of Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University; Key Ramp;amp;D Program of Hubei Province; Translational Medicine and Interdisciplinary Research Joint Fund of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University; 	This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82171922), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2021CFB055), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, 2019 Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical Talents Program, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2042018kf0245), Medical Sci-Tech Innovation Platform of Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University (PTXM2022035), partly supported by Key R & D Program of Hubei Province (Grant No. 2020BCB030), partly supported by the Translational Medicine and Interdisciplinary Research Joint Fund of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University (Grant No. ZNJC201911).		46	0	0	9	9	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1616-301X	1616-3028		ADV FUNCT MATER	Adv.

Herein, the biocompatible ligation of isonitriles and amines to ureas in neutral aqueous medium was developed for the first time. The ligation showed benign nature of biocompatibility, broad substrate scope, and specific chemoselectivity. Meanwhile, urea as a natural linkage, its derivatives played an important role in medicinal chemistry. The second-order reaction rate constant (k2) was determined, which was higher or comparable to that of Staudinger ligation and strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC).

Although an emerging body of research has explored the contributing factors of green innovation, little attention has been paid to the impact of internationalization, especially the different dimensions of internationalization, on green innovation performance. To address this research gap, this research aims to examine the role of both the breadth (geographical range) and depth (intensity) of internationalization on green innovation performance of MNEs, and investigate the moderating roles of MNEs' global dynamic management capability and absorptive capacity. Based on organizational learning theory, this study used secondary data from Chinese listed companies and established econometric models to test the proposed research framework. The results indicated that the breadth of internationalization could enhance MNEs' green innovation performance. Alternatively, the depth of internationalization could inhibit green innovation performance. In addition, the results also revealed that global dynamic managerial and absorptive capacities can both enhance the positive effect between internationalization breadth and green innovation performance while weakening the negative effect of internationalization depth on green innovation performance. This study has implications for strengthening our knowledge of green innovation performance as well as enhancing policy design for sustainable development.

Pharmaco-disparities in heart failure: a survey of the affordability of guideline recommended therapy in 10 countries	ESC HEART FAILURE			English	Article; Early Access						Accessibility; Affordability; Cost; Equity; Heart failure; Pharmaco-disparities; Pharmacotherapy	COVERAGE; CARE	AimsHeart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is treatable but guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) may not be affordable or accessible to people living with the disease.Methods and resultsIn this cross-sectional survey, we investigated the price, affordability, and accessibility of four pivotal classes of HFrEF GDMT: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI); beta-blockers; mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA); and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). We sampled online or community pharmacies in 10 countries across a range of World Bank income groups, assessing mean 30 day retail prescription prices, affordability relative to gross national income per capita per month, and accessibility. We reported median price ratios relative to the International Reference Standard. We performed a literature review to evaluate accessibility to GDMT classes through publicly funded drug programmes in each country. HFrEF GDMT prices, both absolute and relative to the international reference, were highest in the United States and lowest in Pakistan and Bangladesh. The most expensive drug was the ARNI, sacubitril/valsartan, with a mean (standard deviation, SD) 30 day price ranging from $11.06 (0.81) in Pakistan to $611.50 (3.54) in United States. The least expensive drug was the MRA, spironolactone, with a mean (SD) 30 day price ranging from $0.18 (0.00) in Pakistan to $12.32 (0.00) in England. Affordability (SD) of quadruple therapy-ARNI, beta-blockers, MRA, and SGLT2i-was best in high-income and worst in low-income countries, ranging from 1.49 (0.00)% of gross national income per capita per month in England to 232.47 (31.47)% in Uganda. Publicly funded drug programmes offset costs for eligible patients, but ARNI and SGLT2i were inaccessible through these programmes in low- and middle-income countries. Price, affordability, and access were substantially improved in all countries by substituting ARNI for ACEi/ARB.ConclusionsThere was marked variation between countries in the retail price of HFrEF GDMT. Despite higher prices in high-income countries, GDMT was more accessible and affordable than in low- and middle-income countries. Publicly funded drug programmes in lower income countries increased affordability but limited access to newer HFrEF GDMT classes. Pharmaco-disparities must be addressed to improve HFrEF outcomes globally.	[Averbuch, Tauben; Esfahani, Meisam; Van Spall, Harriette G.

Mitigating the impact of winter temperatures on striped catfish (<i>Pangasianodon hypophthalmus</i>) using functional feed additives	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article						antioxidative enzymes; cold stress; fatty acids; functional feed additives; stress indicators	HEAT-SHOCK-PROTEIN; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; THERMAL TOLERANCE; DIETARY SELENIUM; ICTALURUS-PUNCTATUS; ANTIOXIDANT STATUS; CHANNEL CATFISH; RAINBOW-TROUT; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; MUSCLE COMPOSITION	The drop in temperature during the winter months can lead to a decrease in growth, induce metabolic stress, and increase mortality incidences. The present study evaluated the potential of functional feed additives in mitigating the negative impacts of winter-rearing conditions in striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). Four test diets were evaluated over a twelve-week feed trial: (1) zinc-acetate (Zn-acetate), (2) selenomethionine (Se-Met), (3) ss-glucan, and (4) control with no added feed additive. The survival rate in the ss-glucan (95.00%) and Zn-acetate (93.30%) dietary groups was higher than the control (78.30%) and Se-Met (85.00%). Fish fed with the ss-glucan had the highest weight gain (20.75% increase), specific growth rate (13.75% increase), and lower feed conversion ratio (9.64 % decrease). However, feed additives did not influence the fatty acid profiles or whole-body proximate composition. Although, Zn-acetate and Se-Met had higher body ash content. Serum cortisol and glucose levels were lower in ss-glucan and Zn-acetate than in other treatment groups. All feed additives resulted in higher superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity in the liver and muscle. This study found that ss-glucan and zinc-acetate can improve cold stress resistance and offer a sustainable strategy for catfish rearing over winter.

J	Bayram, A; Özsaban, A; Kiliç, ÇT				Bayram, Aysun; Ozsaban, Aysel; Kilic, Cigdem Torun			Verbal violence and missed nursing care: A phenomenological study	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						Care; missed nursing care; nurse; nursing care; qualitative design; Turkey; verbal violence	WORKPLACE VIOLENCE; NURSES; HOSPITALS	AimTo define the missed care experiences of nurses exposed to verbal violence from patients.BackgroundVerbal violence takes the first place among the types of violence that nurses face in healthcare settings. This can cause negative emotional and physical responses in nurses and issues in patient and nurse interaction. As a result, it may lead to missed nursing care, defined as skipped, postponed or incomplete care during the patient's care.MethodsThis is a phenomenological study. The study sample included 16 nurses working in inpatient clinics who reported experiencing verbal violence at least once in Turkey. The study was conducted between January and February 2022 with institutional permission and ethics committee approval (09/12/2021-2021/357). A semi-structured interview method was used to collect data. The information gathered from the interviews underwent thematic analysis using an inductive approach. The 'Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ)' was used to report this qualitative study based on a comprehensive protocol.ResultsThe types of verbal violence most frequently faced by nurses were determined as swearing, insulting, shouting and threats. Study findings were classified into three main themes: (i) response to verbal violence, (ii) missed nursing care experiences and (iii) suggestions to cope with verbal violence. The most felt emotions in the face of verbal violence were feeling sad, unsafe and worthless. Nurses common behaviours, in response to verbal abuse were ignoring, getting used to, and wishing to get away. The examples of missed care included using non-therapeutic communication, postponing care or withdrawing from care.ConclusionVerbal violence caused negative emotional and behavioural responses in nurses, which, in turn, negatively affected the nurse-patient interaction. These findings mean that verbal violence may pave the way for missed nursing care.Implications for nursing policyAccording to these findings, an uninterrupted nursing care process needs to focus on preventive measures against verbal violence and increase the administrative and legal support offered to nurses.

Composites of PVDF/CB-PPy and TPU/CB-PPy were also prepared for comparison. Rheological measurements showed that although the rheological behavior of PVDF/TPU composites was an intermediate behavior between PVDF/CB-PPy and TPU/CB-PPy composites, the effect of the conductive filler was much more pronounced in PVDF than in TPU. Moreover, the addition of CB-PPy was found to increase the storage modulus of the composites leading to more rigid materials, and to decrease the T-g values of the composites due to the reduction of the mobility of the polymeric chains. In addition, PVDF/TPU composites presented an intermediate behavior when compared to composites based on the neat polymers demonstrating that the addition of TPU to PVDF contributes to the development of composites with improved flexibility. Furthermore, the addition of CB-PPy increased the electrical conductivity of all composites. However, the electrical conductivity of PVDF/TPU 50/50 vol% co-continuous blends was higher than the electrical conductivity of PVDF/TPU 38/62 vol% composites with the same amount of conductive filler. Composites with higher electrical conductivity showed better shielding from electromagnetic radiation. As expected, composites based on the co-continuous blend displayed higher EMI shielding efficiency than the 38/62 vol% composites. The main mechanism of shielding was absorption for all composites. Overall, composites based on the PVDF/TPU 50/50 vol% co-continuous blend showed a better combination of EMI shielding efficiency and mechanical properties. Moreover, specimens prepared by fused filament fabrication displayed diminished electrical conductivity and EMI-SE responses when compared to compression-molded samples with the same composition. This difference is attributed to the presence of voids, defects, and overlapping layers, which can hamper the electron flow.

Mo-based catalysts such as Mo2C, MoO2, MoP, MoS2, and MoNx have emerged as promising alternatives to Pt/C owing to their similar electronic structure with Pt and abundant reserve of Mo. On the other hand, due to the adjustable topology, porosity, and nanostructure of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), MOFs are extensively used as precursors to prepare nano-electrocatalysts. In this review, for the first time, the progress of Mo-MOFs-derived electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction is summarized. The preparation method, structures, and catalytic performance of the catalysts are illustrated based on the types of the derived electrocatalysts including Mo2C, MoO2 MoP, MoS2, and MoNx. Especially, the commonly used strategies to improve catalytic performance such as heteroatoms doping, constructing heterogeneous structure, and composited with noble metal are discussed. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges in this area are proposed to guide the designment and development of Mo-based MOF derived electrocatalysts.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining popularity in diagnostic medicine. Oral cancer is a primary global health concern, accounting for 177,384 deaths in 2018; most cases occur in low- and middle-income countries. Automated disease identification in the oral cavity may be facilitated by the ability to identify both possibly and definite malignant lesions. This study aimed to examine the evidence currently available on the effectiveness of AI in diagnosing OC. They highlighted the ability of AI to analyse and identify the early stages of OC. Furthermore, radial basis function networks (RBFN) were employed to develop automated systems to generate intricate patterns for this challenging operation. The stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGDA) selected the model parameters that best matched the predicted and observed results. It can be used. The initial data was collected for this study to evaluate. Two deep learning-based computer vision algorithms have been developed to recognize and categorize oral lesions, which is necessary for the early detection of oral cancer. Several examples of HoG include the Canny edge detector, SIFT (scale invariant and feature transform), and SIFT (scale invariant and feature transform). In computer vision and image processing, it is used to find objects. We investigated the potential uses of deep learning-based computer vision techniques in oral cancer and the viability of an automated system for OC recognition based on photographic images. That made calculations to determine the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve areas across all validation datasets, including internal, external, and clinical validation (AUC). The RBFN-SDC model outperformed all others. For 1000 data points, the accuracy of the RBFN-SDC model is 99.99%, while the accuracy of the R-CNN, CNN, DCNN, and SVM models is 91.54%, 90.14%, 93.89%, and 94.87%, respectively.

Down the drain: The dynamic interplay of governance adjustments addressing setbacks in large public-private projects	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						interorganizational governance; interorganizational projects; longitudinal case research; public-private collaboration; system dynamics simulation; utilities	RELATIONAL GOVERNANCE; PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS; CONTRACTUAL GOVERNANCE; SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; TRUST TRUST; EXCHANGE; MECHANISMS; COMPLEX; BUYER; OPPORTUNISM	Large government projects involving public-private collaborations inherently suffer from setbacks such as delays, cost overruns, or failure to meet contracted performance. Such setbacks may effectively be addressed through adjustments to contractual and relational governance; yet to date, the dynamics of governance adjustments and their interplay in addressing setbacks is not well understood. This research presents a dynamic theory of how parties can effectively address project setbacks through adjustments to contractual and relational governance. The dynamic theory was generated using longitudinal case data from two large public-private projects in the Netherlands that faced comparable project setbacks but deployed opposing governance adjustments, leading to drastically different project outcomes (i.e., collapse vs. recovery). This theory was then elaborated through two more cases and evidence from the literature. A system dynamics simulation model was then built that reproduces the different governance adjustments and outcomes observed in the four projects and serves to extend theory building. The refined theory not only shows under what conditions adjustments to contractual or relational governance are most effective, but also that governance adjustment interplay may trigger unintended side effects. As such, the theory explains why the careful balancing of governance adjustments is critical to project outcomes. Setbacks in public-private projects can effectively be addressed through adjustments to contractual governance (e.g., more flexible vs. more strict contract application) and relational governance (e.g., trusting more or less).Project setbacks can effectively be addressed through adjustments to relational governance, which subsequently allow adjustments to contractual governance, while adjustments to contractual governance preclude adjustments to relational governance and may lead projects to recover slowly or not at all.Contractual and relational governance adjustments warrant careful balancing, as their interplay may lead well-intentioned governance adjustments to have unintended side effects (e.g., adjustments to contractual governance triggering resource investment but also smothering communication).

A viable platform of metallopolymers as adjuvants in combination with traditional antibiotics is reported in this work to combat both planktonic and stationary cells of Gram-negative superbugs and their biofilms. Antibacterial efficacy, toxicity, antibiofilm activity, bacterial resistance propensity, and mechanisms of action of metallopolymer-antibiotic combinations are investigated. These metallopolymers exhibit 4-16-fold potentiation of antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria with negligible toxicity toward mammalian cells. More importantly, the lead combinations (polymer-ceftazidime and polymer-rifampicin) eradicate preformed biofilms of MDR E. coli and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Further, beta-lactamase inhibition, outer membrane permeabilization, and membrane depolarization demonstrate synergy of these adjuvants with different antibiotics. Moreover, the membrane-active metallopolymers enable the antibiotics to circumvent bacterial resistance development. Altogether, the results indicate that such non-antibiotic adjuvants bear the promise to revitalize the efficacy of existing antibiotics to tackle Gram-negative bacterial infections.

It is shown that the linear configuration of diacetylene moieties within conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs) induces a pronounced polarization of electron distribution, which imparts enhanced charge-carrier mobility when compared to CAPs' networks featuring cross-linked arrangements. Moreover, optimizing the intramolecular spacer between diacetylene moieties within the linear structure leads to the exceptional modulation of the band structures, specifically resulting in a downshifted valence band (VB) and rendering the two-electron water oxidation pathway thermodynamically feasible for H2O2 production. Consequently, the optimized CAPs with a linear configuration (LCAP-2), featuring spatially separated reduction centers (benzene rings) and oxidation centers (diacetylene moieties), exhibit a remarkable H2O2 yield rate of 920.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), superior than that of the linear LCAP-1 (593.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and the cross-linked CCAP (433.4 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) and solar-to-chemical energy conversion (SCC) efficiency of LCAP-2 are calculated to be 9.1% ( lambda = 420 nm) and 0.59%, respectively, surpassing the performance of most previously reported conjugated polymers.

J	Linkosalmi, M; Lohila, A; Biasi, C				Linkosalmi, Maiju; Lohila, Annalea; Biasi, Christina			Stronger negative priming effect and lower basal respiration rates in nutrient-poor as compared to nutrient-rich forestry-drained peatland	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							SOIL MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-MATTER; CARBON SINK; PINE MIRES; DECOMPOSITION; CO2; MECHANISMS; VEGETATION; MINERALIZATION; MICROORGANISMS	RationaleLand-use changes, e.g., forestry drainage, modify the characteristics of peatland soil and affect the peatland carbon (C) balance. Peat soil nutrient status, related mainly to the original peatland type, also has an impact on the C balance after drainage, as observed earlier at the ecosystem scale for two forestry-drained sites in Southern Finland. Here the aim was to compare the soil CO2 fluxes from the two sites, nutrient-poor and nutirent-rich forestry-drained peatlands, and study the effect of plant photosynthates on the decomposition of peat C. Therefore, the respiration rates and priming effect (PE) of peat soils with variable nutrient status were examined in the laboratory. MethodsHalf of the samples were labelled with C-13-glucose to study the effect of fresh C addition on the soil decomposition. The (CO2)-C-13-samples were analysed with isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A two-pool mixing model was applied to separate the soil- and sugar-derived respirations and to determine the PE. ResultsThe nutrient-rich peat soil respired generally more than the nutrient-poor peat. A negative PE was observed in both peat soils, suggesting that the addition of fresh C did not increase the soil decomposition, but on the contrary decreased it. The negative PE was significantly more pronounced in nutrient-poor peat soil than in the nutrient-rich peat treatments, suggesting that the higher nutrient availability suppresses the negative PE. ConclusionsThese results imply that microbes prefer utilizing fresh C instead of old C in the short term and that the peat decomposition is suppressed in the presence of fresh C inputs from vegetation at forestry-drained peatlands. These effects are even stronger in peat soils with less nutrients available. Ecosystem scale and soil process models could be improved with the help of these results.

Analyzing policy responses of 106 nations and personal responses from 105,203 individuals in 104 nations during the first wave of the pandemic, we found that nation-level neoliberalism (delineated by the economic freedom index) negatively predicted the nonlinear trajectories of government policy responses to contain the pandemic. Specifically, in more neoliberal countries, stringent containment policy responses showed a sharper decline in the later stage of the first wave of the pandemic. Moreover, nation-level neoliberalism negatively predicted individuals' pandemic-protective attitudes and behaviors. All these effects are independent of and incremental to those of nation-level individualism. In conclusion, this study sheds light on how neoliberalism could lead to negative consequences during large-scale, long-lasting public threats, offering practical guidance for adjusting public crisis management in the future.

We examine the effectiveness of the regulation in changing the link between analyst research and trading, the research-trading link, and the analyst response to this potential change in incentives. Using a difference-in-differences research design, we find that forecast frequency, optimism, and accuracy are less associated with the brokerage trading share after MiFID II, suggesting that MiFID II weakened the link between the brokerage share of trading and analyst research. Following MiFID II, analysts in Europe are less likely than analysts in the United States to continue high forecast frequency, optimism, and accuracy for stocks with high share importance for the analyst's brokerage house. We find similar results throughout for buy/sell recommendations. Overall, our evidence suggests that MiFID II is at least partially successful in unbundling research from execution, and impacts both the trading effects and the production of analyst research.

Here, for the first time, the memristive properties of geopolymers, inexpensive ceramic materials manufactured at room temperature from alkaline activation of amorphous aluminosilicate precursors, are presented. It is demonstrated that geopolymers present all the fingerprints of memristors, and a physics-based model is proposed, which demonstrates that electroosmosis in the bulk geopolymer pores induces ion channels that foster change in the overall conductance of the bulk material, contributing to the observed memristive behavior. This model opens the door to a new category of porous electroosmosis-based bulk memristors. Synaptic functions such as short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity, as well as endurance and retention capabilities are also demonstrated. The reported findings pave the way to the use of geopolymers for low-cost applications in neuromorphic computing.

The aim of this review was to summarize the cases of brachial plexopathy as a consequence of the prone position in COVID-19 patients, and thus bring closer the issue of the brachial plexus in the face of clinical aspects of its function, palsy, and consequences. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement was followed, inclusion criteria were created according to Patients, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes (PICO). PubMed and Scopus were searched until April 1, 2023 by entering the key term with Boolean terms. The risk of bias was assessed using JBI's critical appraisal tools. Fifteen papers with 30 patients were included in the review. This study showed that brachial plexopathy after the prone position occurs more often among males, who are at least 50 years old with comorbidities like hypertension, overweight, and diabetes mellitus. The most common symptoms were weakness, pain, and motion deficits. Duration of the prone position session and the number of episodes were different as well as the modification of positioning. Brachial plexopathy is a significant problem during prone position, especially when hospitalization is prolonged, patients are males, have comorbidities, and changes in body weight. Attention should be drawn to understand the anatomy of the brachial plexus, correct positioning, avoiding factors worsening the prognosis, and proper nutrition of the patients.

Conventional membranes suffer from a trade-off between salt rejection and water permeability, raising a need for developing new classes of membranes. C-based membranes with porous graphene and carbon nanotubes offer high salt rejection, water permeability, and fouling resistance. However, controlling the pore size of these membranes is challenging. Therefore, a carbon honeycomb membrane is studied using classical molecular dynamics simulations. It is reported that functionalization with -COO- groups provides 100% salt rejection with around 1000 times higher water permeability than conventional polyamide membranes. Atomic-level understanding of the effect of the functional groups' location on salt rejection and water permeability is developed.

Registration of Arkot 1112, Arkot 1114, and Arkot 1115 cotton germplasm lines	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS			English	Article							SEED; DENSITY; YIELD; SCORE	Arkot 1112 (Reg. no. GP-1139, PI 702559), Arkot 1114 (Reg. no. GP-1140, PI 702560), and Arkot 1115 (Reg. no. GP-1141, PI 702561) are conventional cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) germplasm lines released by the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station in November, 2022. The three lines share Arkot 0306 (PI 671966) as a common parent. The second parents for Arkot 1112, Arkot 1114, and Arkot 1115 were 'UA222' (US patent no. 8,859,862), Arkot 0309 (PI 669969), and Arkot 0316 (PI 669970), respectively. The three lines were compared with 'UA48' and UA222 in replicated field tests at four Arkansas sites over 5 years. Over these tests, each of the three lines produced about 11 and 25% higher lint yields than UA48 and UA222, respectively. Lint yields of Arkot 1115 exceeded those of Arkot 1112 and Arkot 1114. Over 10 locations of the 2019 Regional Breeders Testing Network test, lint yields of Arkot 1112, Arkot 1114, and Arkot 1115 were equal to each other and ranked third, fourth, and fifth, respectively, out of 22 genotypes, indicating that the lines have wide adaptation. Leaf pubescence, stem pubescence, and bract trichome density of the lines were higher than UA48 and similar to UA222. All three lines displayed high resistance to bacterial blight. The lines were more resistant to tarnished plant bug than UA48 but were more susceptible to tarnished plant bug than UA222. Fiber quality of Arkot 1115 approached that of UA48 (excellent fiber quality), whereas Arkot 1112 and Arkot 1114 was similar to UA222 (good fiber quality). Arkot 1112, Arkot 1114, and Arkot 1115 are conventional cotton germplasm lines released by the University of Arkansas.The three lines were derived from crosses of Arkot 0306 with UA222, Arkot 0309, and Arkot 0316.All three lines produced higher yields than UA48 and UA222 in Arkansas tests.All three lines produced high yields across contrasting environment of 2019 Regional Breeders' Network Test.The lines combine superior host plant resistance, fiber quality, earliness, and yield traits.

Externalities of Financial Statement Fraud on the Incoming Accounting Labor Force	JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						financial statement fraud; accounting; labor force; higher education	CURRENT EVENTS KNOWLEDGE; COLLEGE MAJOR; INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS; CORPORATE SCANDALS; AUDIT QUALITY; SELF; INFORMATION; VALUES; PERSONALITY; ABILITY	Financial statement fraud generates many negative effects, including reducing people's willingness to participate in the stock market. If it also stigmatizes accounting, it may similarly adversely affect the quantity and quality of workers willing to become accountants, thereby potentially creating negative effects for years to come. We examine the impact of fraud on the labor force entering the accounting profession, which is a key input into the production of accounting information (i.e., the output). Using data describing millions of college students across the United States, we find incoming students are actually more likely to major in accounting when local frauds occur during their formative years. These students are also more likely to have attributes desired by the accounting profession (e.g., high academic aptitude) and are more likely to subsequently serve in public accounting and become Certified Public Accountants. In the context of other fields (i.e., all college majors), we find that fraud similarly spurs interest in other business disciplines, but not in majors outside of business schools. Those attracted to other business disciplines, however, generally possess different traits. Specifically, students entering accounting are distinctively more likely to exhibit values espoused by the accounting profession, including a predisposition to public service and less commercial orientation. Thus, nonpecuniary motives appear to uniquely drive accounting student enrollment following fraud. Collectively, our findings suggest that, while fraud is unmistakably bad, it appears to have the positive unintended consequence of attracting labor into business disciplines and, in accounting, increasing the prevalence of desirable traits among entrants.

The optimal formulations were determined and tested for coating sliced cheese during storage. FOS and IN generally increased the thickness and moisture values of the films, while opacity increased with the increase in IN concentration. Tensile strength decreased with FOS and IN, and elongation at break decreased at high prebiotic concentrations. The viability of L. rhamnosus after the drying of the film solution was between 77.67% and 89.91%, and total prebiotic concentration above 2% generally decreased drying stability of L. rhamnosus. The optimal formulations were 0% FOS + 0% IN, 1% FOS + 0% IN and 0% FOS + 1% IN, respectively. These film matrices were found to be suitable carriers for L. rhamnosus. Coating treatments reduced moisture loss, acidity and hardness increase in cheese slices, but decreased luminosity. The probiotic counts in coated cheese were sufficient for therapeutic effect after approximately 20 days.

However, comprehensive research on this topic from the region is lacking. Our study aims to investigate trends in early-onset CRC in Asia over 10 years, filling this research gap.MethodsThis study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to assess temporal trends in early-onset CRC in the Asia-Pacific. The analysis included estimating annual frequencies and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of early-onset CRC incidence, death, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by gender.ResultsThe incidence of early-onset CRC significantly increased in both regions with higher increase and in the Western Pacific region. Notable increases were observed among males in the Western Pacific and females in Southeast Asia (SEA). Mortality rates remained stable in the Western Pacific but increased by 10.6% in SEA, especially among females. DALYs due to CRC also increased significantly in SEA, with a greater rise among females. The Western Pacific had the highest CRC incidence, and in SEA, the mortality rate was higher in females than males.ConclusionsOur study reveals a substantial increase in early-onset CRC in the Asia-Pacific underscoring the urgency for effective interventions. Thus, a comprehensive approach comprising controlled risk reduction, health promotion to heightened disease awareness, and implementation of effective screening strategies should be executed timely to mitigate the burden of early-onset CRC. image	[Danpanichkul, Pojsakorn] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Immunol Unit, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Moolkaew, Pinyada] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Med, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Kanjanakot, Yatawee] Mae Fah Luang Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Chiang Rai, Thailand; [Polpichai, Natchaya] Weiss Mem Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Chicago, IL USA; [Jaroenlapnopparat, Aunchalee] Harvard Med Sch, Mt Auburn Hosp, Dept Med, Cambridge, MA USA; [Kim, Donghee] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Stanford, CA USA; [Lukens, Frank J.] Mayo Clin Florida, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Jacksonville, FL USA; [Wassef, Wahid; Fallon, Michael B.; Wijarnpreecha, Karn] Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Wassef, Wahid; Fallon, Michael B.; Wijarnpreecha, Karn] Banner Univ Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Phoenix, AZ 85006 USA; [Chen, Vincent L.] Univ Michigan, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Lui, Rashid] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Digest Dis, Dept Clin Oncol, Dept Med & Therapeut, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lui, Rashid] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Inst Digest Dis, Dept Med & Therapeut, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Chiang Mai University; Chiang Mai University; Mae Fah Luang University; Harvard University; Mount Auburn Hospital; Stanford University; Mayo Clinic; University of Arizona; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong	Danpanichkul, P (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Microbiol, Immunol Unit, Chiang Mai, Thailand.; Wijarnpreecha, K (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Coll Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.; Wijarnpreecha, K (corresponding author), Banner Univ Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Phoenix, AZ 85006 USA.	pojsakorndan@gmail.com; dr.karn.wi@gmail.com	Kim, Donghee/C-4288-2013	Kim, Donghee/0000-0003-1919-6800	The authors would like to acknowledge the use of mapchart.net for creating the maps utilized in this study.

Tendon Extracellular Matrix Promotes Myotendinous Junction Protein Expression in Engineered Muscle Tissue under Both Static and Mechanically Stimulated Culture Conditions	JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA; SKELETAL; CONSTRUCTS; BIOREACTOR; PAXILLIN; IMPROVES	Studying the crosstalk between the muscle and tendon tissue is an important yet understudied area in musculoskeletal research. In vitro models can help elucidate the function and repair of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) under static and dynamic culture conditions using engineered muscle tissues. The goal of this study was to culture engineered muscle tissues in a novel bioreactor in both static and mechanically stimulated cultures and evaluate the expression of MTJ-specific proteins within the muscle-tendon unit(paxillin and type XXII collagen). C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in hydrogels made from type I collagen ortendon-derived extracellular matrix (tECM) and allowed to form around movable anchors. Engineered tissues were allowed to form and stabilize for 10 days. After 10 days in the culture, stimulated cultures were cyclically stimulated for 3 hours per day for 2 and 4 weeks alongside static cultures. Strain values at the maximum displacement of the anchors averaged about 0.10, a target that has been shown to induce myogenic phenotype in C2C12s. Protein expression of paxillin after 2 weeks did not differ between hydrogel materials in static cultures but increased by 62% in tECM when mechanically stimulated. These differences continued after 4 weeks, with 31% and 57% increases in tECM tissues relative to type I collagen. Expression of type XXII collagen was similarly influenced by hydrogel material and culture conditions. Overall, this research combined a relevant microenvironment to study muscle and tendon interactions with a novel bioreactor to apply mechanical strain, an important regulator of the formation and maintenance of the native MTJ.

The impact of various management practices (supplementary irrigation during the rainy season, improved fertilization, cropping during the dry season and mulching practices) on irrigation water requirements, crop productivity and the multifunctional roles of irrigated paddy rice was evaluated in diverse agro-ecological zones of Zambia, by using the AquaCrop model. Irrigation development has been demonstrated to boost paddy rice production (by 8%) in the southern districts by providing supplementary irrigation (about 150 mm) during the rainy season. Additionally, supplementary irrigation during the rainy season can make improved fertilization more attractive, doubling the yield rise under rainfed conditions. The required irrigation development would also enable paddy rice cropping intensification by allowing for dry season sowing (with net irrigation requirements from 700 to 800 mm). Moreover, the associated straw production increase could also play an important role as mulch during the dry season, reducing the net irrigation requirements by 15%. These findings will enable policymakers to make informed decisions regarding investment strategies and policies.

The occurrence of various cases and multidrug resistance confirm that TB has not been completely conquered. For these reasons, the present research has been conducted to explore TB vaccine and drug candidate possibility using Mtb-secreted proteins. Among these proteins, MPT32 is known to have antigenicity and immunogenicity. There has not been a report on the host immune responses and regulation in macrophage cells. The present study was conducted with MPT32 in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells that control immune responses by sensing pathogen invasion and environmental change. We have found that MPT32 could activate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced gene expression of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells. After treating cells with MPT32, the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 ss (IL-1 ss) and IL-6, was observed. In addition, activated macrophages expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to generate various inflammatory mediator molecules, such as nitric oxide (NO). The increase in iNOS and COX-2 levels, which are up-regulators of MMP-9 expression, was also confirmed. The biochemical events are involved in the downstream of activated MAPK signaling and translocation of NF-kappa B transcription factor. The present results prove the immunomodulatory effect of MPT32 in the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. it claims the possibility of a TB vaccination and drug candidate using MPT32, contributing to the prevention of TB.

Scrum framework is a project management technique that can emphasize software development teamwork. If you are starting, consider scrum as a method for accomplishing tasks as a team in manageable chunks simultaneously, with ongoing experimentation and feedback loops to learn and improve as you go. Scrum enables individuals and groups to collaboratively and gradually generate value. Being an agile framework, scrum gives people and teams the perfect structure to fit into their workflows while still including the best practices to cater to their requirements. There are some important considerations for security in the agile software development process such as threat modeling, secure coding practices, continuous security testing, authentication, and authorization. In this work, we reviewed various scrum developing techniques to find out the research gaps. This article consider the scrum technique with blockchain technologies for review because it is preferred by most of the software industries.

This phenomenon is based on the interaction between the nanoscopic ionic behavior at the solid-liquid interface and the flow of electrons in a semiconductor electrode. Ionovoltaic research aims to present the most rational and convincing mechanism for the much-debated principle of energy conversion by water motion through a deeper understanding of solid-liquid interfacial phenomena and to discuss the potential to transform related fields through the development of enabling technologies such as novel energy harvesters, interfacial analysis tools, and bio/chemical sensors. Furthermore, efforts to develop high-efficiency ionovoltaic device powered by small water droplets indicate a potential contribution to the advancement of green energy systems that complement solar and wind power generation and address environmental pollution and energy shortages. This review paper explores the evolution of energy harvesting technologies using water motion, with a particular focus on ionovoltaics as an emerging field. By establishing the fundamentals, this study investigates solid-liquid interfaces, semiconductor properties, and natural water motion-driven ionovoltaic phenomena and also highlights that extensive research on complex ion/interface phenomena can have practical applications in diverse industrial fields.image	[Lee, Won Hyung; Kim, Youn Sang] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Convergence Sci & Technol, Program Nano Sci & Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Junwoo] Sogang Univ, Dept Chem, Seoul, South Korea; [Yoon, Sun Geun] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA USA; [Jin, Huding; Han, Junghyup; Kim, Youn Sang] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Coll Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Jin, Huding; Han, Junghyup; Kim, Youn Sang] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Chem Proc, Coll Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Youn Sang] Adv Inst Convergence Technol, Suwon, South Korea; [Kim, Youn Sang] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Youn Sang] Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Chem Proc, Seoul 08826, South Korea	Seoul National University (SNU); Sogang University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU)	Kim, YS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea.; Kim, YS (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Chem Proc, Seoul 08826, South Korea.	younskim@snu.ac.kr		Kim, Youn Sang/0000-0002-4580-2037	This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea (RS-2023-00208273).; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea;  [RS-2023-00208273]	This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea (RS-2023-00208273).; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); 	This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea (RS-2023-00208273).		123	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA		2567-3173		ECOMAT	EcoMat	AUG 29	2023									e12408	10.1002/eom2.12408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eom2.12408			26	Chemistry, Physical; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science	Q4LI8		gold			2023-10-18	WOS:001057246500001

Here, a novel vacuum induction strategy is used to synthesize nickel boride/nickel (Ni3B/Ni) heterostructure catalyst for electrochemical oxidation of methanol into formic acid. The catalyst has extremely high reactivity (only 146.9 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), the maximum current density reaches 555.70 mA mg-1 and 443.87 mA cm(-2)), ultra-high selectivity (Faraday efficiency of methanol conversion to formic acid is close to 100%), and ultra-long life (over 50 h at 100 mA cm(-2)). In-suit electrochemical impedance spectroscopy proved that MeOH is oxidized first and inhibits the phase transition of the electrocatalyst to the high-valent electrooxidation products, which not only enables the high selectivity of MeOH oxidation but also ensures high stability of the catalyst. The mechanism studies by density functional theory calculations show that the potential determining step, the formation of *CH2O, occurs most favorably in the Ni3B/Ni heterostructure. These results provide references for the development of MeOH oxidation catalysts with high activity, high stability, high selectivity, and low cost.

Alopecia extended from the face to the outside of the auricle, and was accompanied by thickening of the dorsal eyelid and scales on the dorsal chest. Histopathological examination revealed infiltration of lymphocytes targeting the hair follicle wall and deposition of mucin in the isthmus of hair follicles. A diagnosis of degenerative mucinotic mural folliculitis was obtained based on the clinical and histological findings. The cat was treated with ciclosporin (9.3 mg/kg) administered once daily. The alopecia and thickening resolved, and the general condition improved. The cat was clinically well for 10 months. The cat has survived 14 months since treatment was started. This case demonstrates the efficacy of high-dose ciclosporin in treating degenerative mucinotic mural folliculitis.

Water-in-salt electrolytes (WISEs), which extend the stability of aqueous electrolytes in rechargeable batteries, are one example. While the hype for WISEs is huge, commercial WISE-based rechargeable batteries are still far from reality, and there remain several fundamental knowledge gaps such as those related to their long-term reactivity and stability. Here, we propose a comprehensive approach to accelerating the study of WISE reactivity by using radiolysis to exacerbate the degradation mechanisms of concentrated LiTFSI-based aqueous solutions. We find that the nature of the degradation species depends strongly on the molality of the electrolye, with degradation routes driven by the water or the anion at low or high molalities, respectively. The main aging products are consistent with those observed by electrochemical cycling, yet radiolysis also reveals minor degradation species, providing a unique glimpse of the long-term (un)stability of these electrolytes.

The extremely high mechanical strength and the ultra-wide bandgap energy enable the development of mechanically and thermally robust MEMS/NEMS sensors and switches, while the long coherence time of spin defects center enables the reading out through optical methods, precise quantum sensing, and quantum information processing. In this paper, the development of diamond-based MEMS/NEMS from the viewpoints of classic devices to quantum systems are reviewed. The fabrication process and the classic applications of diamond MEMS/NEMS devices are first described, including those from micro-crystalline, nano-crystalline/ultranano-crystalline, and single-crystalline diamonds. Then, the physical properties of nitrogen-vacancy defect center, as well as the application referred to the hybrid system composed of MEMS structures and nitrogen-vacancy centers embedded, strain-spin interaction, and diamond-based optomechanics are introduced. Finally, a conclusion and outlook are presented. It is expected that diamond MEMS/NEMS is not only an ideal platform for high-performance and high-reliability advanced classic MEMS devices but also for quantum sensing, information, and exploring the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

The effort to press forward the translational progress has been frustrated by the insufficient understanding of immunophenotype of CNS and tumor genetic alterations of PCNSL, and the lack of validated diagnostic biomarkers. Researchers now have a variety of PCNSL animal models at their disposal that resemble the morphology and immunophenotype of PCNSL, however, a careful and detailed re-examination of these animal models is needed to clarify the differences in genetic alterations, migration capability, and immune status. In this review, we present the knowledge about the phenotypic and genotypic features of PCNSL tumor cells, and compile the preclinical animal models of PCNSL with regard to various injection sites, cell origins, recipient animals, and immune status, and elaborate on the tropism and migration of tumor cells and novel therapeutic strategies for PCNSL. We envisage that the selection of suitable animal models will serve as a well-defined preclinical system to understand the molecular pathogenesis of PCNSL, thereby galvanizing the development of novel and potent therapeutic approaches.

Here, using saccharides as the representatives, we reveal that the electrostatic polarity of non-sacrificial additives is a critical descriptor for their ability to stabilize Zn anodes. Non-sacrificial additives are found to continuously modulate the solvation structure of Zn ions and form a molecular adsorption layer (MAL) for uniform Zn deposition, avoiding the thick solid electrolyte interphase layer due to the decomposition of sacrificial additives. A high electrostatic polarity renders sucrose the best hydrated Zn2+ desolvation ability and facilitates the MAL formation, resulting in the best cycling stability with a long-term reversible plating/stripping cycle life of thousands of hours. This study provides theoretical guidance for the screening of optimal additives for high-performance ZIBs.

The present study examines whether the most studied decision-making styles are related to self-reported effort, goal progress, and action crisis as well as other goal dimensions. We conducted 14 studies (mutual conceptual replications) with N-total = 2574 (70% females) which included the General Decision-Making Styles questionnaire and various goal-related scales. The results from the mini meta-analysis showed that the rational and intuitive styles were positively related to the goal dimensions associated with successful goal pursuit (e.g., goal commitment, goal attainability, positive emotions, and goal progress), while the avoidant style was mainly related to various difficulties associated with goal striving (e.g., controlled motivation, negative emotions, and action crisis). The dependent and especially spontaneous styles were found to be very weakly associated with the selected goal dimensions. When the separate studies were analyzed in the regression analyses and more process-oriented goal dimensions were accounted for, decision-making styles were only minor predictors of self-reported effort expenditure, goal progress and action crisis. The study highlights the need and usefulness of a more nuanced processual approach in the research of individual decision-making differences in goal-directed behavior.

Hydrogels are the amplifiers of material properties using manipulation in structure-property relationship via simple, economic yet effective routes. Herein, a set of composite and hybrid hydrogels are developed by hierarchical assembling of clay nanosheets and surfactant micelles those divulge the first example of memcapacitor gels and offer exceptional proton conductivity (1.66-4.34 x 10(-2) S cm(-1)) as a gel material. Further, Congo red, Eosin Y, and Orange G are used to hybridize one of the composites to achieve three hybrid hydrogels. Such hybridization is found to regulate the memristive function selectively from the coupled effect of memcapacitance from the composite. The composite hydrogel highlights its volatile memory with encouraging robustness under environmental conditions, established through various current-voltage (I-V) experiments. The electrochemical behaviors including the high proton conductivity are realized from impedance measurements. Material characterizations, experimental results, and in silico optimized structures rationalize composite/hybrid network formation, capacitive/memristive responses, and enhanced proton conduction in the fabricated composite superstructures. Proposed structural models demonstrate two orthogonally oriented structural encryptions to be accountable for the expressed bifunctionality in the hierarchically designed superstructures.

J	Chaplot, V; Smith, P				Chaplot, Vincent; Smith, Pete			Cover crops do not increase soil organic carbon stocks as much as has been claimed: What is the way forward?	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						land; management; organic matter; quality; soil	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; GREEN MANURE; NO-TILLAGE; MATTER; MANAGEMENT; SEQUESTRATION; STORAGE; SYSTEM; INPUT	When compared to virgin land (forest and grassland), croplands store significantly lower amounts of organic carbon (OC), mainly as a result of soil tillage, and decreased plant inputs to the soil over the whole year. Doubts have been expressed over how much reduced and zero tillage agriculture can increase OC in soils when the whole soil profile is considered. Consequently, cover-crops that are grown in-between crops instead of leaving soils bare appear as the "last man standing" in our quest to enhance cropland OC stocks. Despite the claim by numerous meta-analyses of a mean carbon sequestration rate by cover crops to be as high as 0.32 +/- 0.08 ton C ha(-1) year(-1), the present analysis showed that all of the 37 existing field studies worldwide only sampled to a depth of 30 cm or less and did not compare treatments on the basis of equivalent soil mass. Thirteen studies presented information on OC content only and not on OC stocks, had inappropriate controls (n = 14), had durations of 3 years or lower (n = 5), considered only one to two data points per treatment (n = 4), or used cover crops as cash crops (i.e., grown longer that in-between two crops) instead of catch crops (n = 2), which in all cases constitutes shortcomings. Of the remaining six trials, four showed non-significant trends, one study displayed a negative impact of cover crops, and one study displayed a positive impact, resulting in a mean OC storage of 0.03 ton ha(-1) year(-1). Models and policies should urgently adapt to such new figure. Finally, more is to be done not only to improve the design of cover-crop studies for reaching sound conclusions but also to understand the underlying reasons of the low efficiency of cover crops for improved carbon sequestration into soils, with possible strategies being suggested.

Herein, we introduced a family of Janus-type ESIPT chromophores featuring distinctive hydrogen bond (H-bond) selectivity between competitive HBAs in a single molecule. Our investigations showed that the central hydroxyl group preferentially forms intramolecular H-bonds with imines in imine-modified 2-hydroxyphenyl benzothiazole (HBT) chromophores but tethers the benzothiazole moiety in hydrazone-modified HBT chromophores. Imine-derived HBTs generally exhibit higher fluorescence efficiency, while hydrazone-derived HBTs show a reduced overlap between the absorption and fluorescence bands. Quantum chemical calculations unveiled the molecular origins of the biased intramolecular H-bonds and their impact on the ESIPT process. This Janus-type ESIPT chromophore skeleton provides new opportunities for the design of solid luminescent materials.

J	Fontanetta, E				Fontanetta, Emily			Sweet dreams are made of this: The need for narrowly tailored statutory protection for documented dreamers	FAMILY COURT REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						aging out; backlog; bipartisan support; competition; congress; dependent; documented dreamers; dual-intent; economic growth; immigrant visa; immigration and nationality act; new visa status; nonimmigrant visa; plenary power; U.S. citizenship and immigration services		The growing backlog of immigrant visa petitions and legal permanent resident adjustment applications is a harsh reality of the American dream. Dependent children of immigrants can wait decades for their parents' visas to become current, only to age out of dependent status before stepping foot on American soil. Dependent children of nonimmigrants seeking to become legal permanent residents age out before their parents' adjustment application is approved - leaving them at risk of removal. This Note proposes a temporary visa status for these dependents, allowing them to maintain legal status in America and remain with their parents. In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, a group of America's largest companies warn that, without intervention, as many as 200,000 children in the United States risk aging out of their parents' immigration status and will likely be sent back to their birth country, forcibly separated from their parents. The average age of dependents brought to the United States with the expectation of living here permanently is 5 years old.Existing and proposed legislation reflects a protective spirit towards children in the immigration system; however, there is no remedy directly on point with the aging out problem.Companies like Google, Amazon, IBM, Salesforce, Twitter, and Uber are losing out on foreign-born talent, integral to their growth, who either cannot get into the United States or are deterred by the stringent immigration policy and thus take their expertise to China or other competitive countries.Children of immigrants exhibit high intellectual achievement, particularly in STEM fields, filling a gap in the American workforce.

We quantify climate policy uncertainty in China based on the news from two leading mainland newspapers: the Renmin Daily and the Guangming Daily. Using the sample of Chinese A-share companies from January 2003 to September 2021, we find robust evidence that firms exhibit lower levels of investment when facing to higher climate policy uncertainty. Specifically, we also show that this negative effect is more profound for state-owned enterprises, carbon-intensive enterprises, and enterprises with lower risk taking. The results also give evidence that the effect of climate policy uncertainty on firm investment can last up to three quarters and disappear within 1 year. Finally, we propose that investment irreversibility is plausible channel through which climate policy uncertainty discourages investment. Overall, these results shed light on the real effects of climate policy uncertainty and the determinants of investment.

In our hands L1 is best prepared by a Michael addition catalyzed by Cs2CO3 and L2 by a catalyst- and solvent-free reaction. Both L1 and L2 react with PdCl2(COD) to produce trans-PdCl2(L1)(2) (3) and trans-PdCl2(L2)2 (4) respectively. The crystal structures of both new complexes have been determined. An isomerization has been observed when complex 4 is dissolved in CDCl3 or CD3CN. Kinetic data indicate that this is an equilibrium that is first order in both directions. We suggest this may be due to the isomerization of the trans- to the cis-isomer. Their ease of preparation in nearly quantitative yields make the new ligands L1 and L2 potentially useful for further studies.

J	Kolli, AR				Kolli, Aditya R.			Deriving protein binding-corrected chemical concentrations for in vitro testing	CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access							PLASMA-PROTEIN; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; DISPOSITION; METABOLISM; RITONAVIR; LOPINAVIR; DRUGS; DOGS; RATS	Extracellular chemical concentrations are considered physiologically relevant for in vitro testing and are evaluated in traditional in vitro systems using cell culture media containing 5%-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, depending on the physicochemical properties, and in vitro testing conditions, cells could be exposed to variable unbound extracellular concentrations. If in vitro unbound concentrations are not calculated, it is challenging to distinguish the chemical potency and concentration-driven responses. In this study, one- and two-protein binding models were used to estimate protein binding corrected chemical concentrations of various chemicals for in vitro testing. As ceftizoxime, moxifloxacin, and nicotine have low protein binding affinity, the in vitro protein binding in 5%-10% FBS is less than 5% and can be considered negligible. However, protein binding of moderate and highly protein-bound chemicals must be corrected for as the in vitro unbound concentrations in 5%-10% FBS containing cell culture media will vary over a range of chemical concentrations. In vitro pharmacological and toxicological assessments must incorporate protein binding-adjusted in vitro concentrations to ensure physiologically relevant exposures. A user-friendly Excel spreadsheet is provided to help bench scientists calculate protein binding-corrected chemical concentrations for in vitro testing.

FOOD SCIENCE & NUTRITION			English	Article						diet; dietary inflammatory index; gingival index; inflammation; periodontal diseases; periodontal health	GINGIVAL INDEX; DENTAL-CARIES; DISEASE; CONSUMPTION; NUTRITION; IMPACT; FIBER	Inflammation is among the risks of periodontal diseases. The relationship between the inflammatory load of the diet and inflammation has been shown in previous studies, but the relationship between periodontal diseases and the inflammatory load of the diet is not clear. In this study, it was aimed to examine the relationship between dietary inflammatory index (DII) and periodontal health. Board approved the protocol. Information about the study was given to the patients who met the criteria of the study and agreed to participate in the study. Oral health status was evaluated by measuring the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT). Periodontal health status was determined using the plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI). Twenty-four-hour dietary record was taken for 1 day to calculate the inflammatory load gained from daily diet, and the DII score was used. The study group consisted of 138 participants. DMFT scores were found with median 4.0, and no statistically significant difference was observed between DII quartiles. 65.8% of the participants had absence or small amount of plaque accumulation, while 39.2% had moderate or dense amount of plaque accumulation according to the PI classification. While DII did not differ by PI classification, DII quartile between second and third found a difference according to the GI classification. The new definition of periodontal health has been proposed as the absence of clinically detectable inflammation. It seems that pro-inflammatory properties of the diet and periodontal health are related. But future randomized controlled trials are needed.

Poly(ethylene terephthalate)-polyethylene block copolymer architecture effects on interfacial adhesion and blend compatibilization	JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						block copolymers; compatibilization; molecular architecture; multilayer films; plastic recycling	HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATIONS; REACTIVE COMPATIBILIZATION; MULTIBLOCK COPOLYMERS; MECHANICAL COMPATIBILIZATION; HOMOPOLYMER; POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE); POLYSTYRENE; DIFFUSION; VISCOSITY	In this study, poly(ethylene terephthalate)-block-polyethylene (PET-PE) multiblock copolymers (MBCPs) with block molar masses of 4 or 7 kg mol-1 and either alternating or random block sequencing, and a PE-PET-PE triblock copolymer (TBCP) of comparable total molar mass, were synthesized. To explore the effect of molecular architecture on compatibilization, both MBCPs and TBCPs were blended into 80/20 wt/wt mixtures of PET/linear low-density PE (LLDPE). Compatibilization was remarkably efficient for all MBCP types, with the addition of 0.2 wt% yielding blends nearly as tough as PET homopolymer. Addition of MBCP also significantly decreases LLDPE dispersed phase sizes compared to PET/LLDPE neat blends, as much as 80% in as-mixed blends and by a factor of 10 in post-mixing thermally annealed samples. Conversely, the TBCP was less efficient at decreasing domain sizes of the blends and improving the mechanical properties, requiring loadings of 1 wt% to produce comparably tough blends. Peel tests of PET/BCP/LLDPE trilayer films showed that both MBCPs and TBCP all improve interfacial strength over a PET-PE bilayer film by two orders of magnitude; however, when the BCPs were preloaded into LLDPE, only the MBCP containing films showed strong adhesion highlighting their potential utility as adhesive agents in multilayer films.

Without information summarizing variables pertaining to staff injury in behavior-analytic service settings, organizational leaders risk the safety of staff they employ. Despite the social relevance, few studies concerning the types of client-related staff injuries have been published. The purpose of this survey was to gather data on the cause, type, bodily location of, and treatment required for staff injury by surveying organizations that serve individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Respondents ranked the leading cause of injury as client-to-staff interactions, type of injury as bite, location of injury as arm, and the most common treatment required as on-site first aid. These initial data could assist in the identification of job tasks that may be associated with increased risk of injury, potential ramifications of client-inflicted injuries on staff performance and organizational outcomes, and how to address injuries in settings within an injury-prone industry. Implications and future research ideas are also discussed.

J	Tang, WT				Tang, Wentao			Data-driven state observation for nonlinear systems based on online learning	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						dimensionality reduction; nonlinear systems; online optimization; state observer	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION	For controlling nonlinear processes represented by state-space models, a state observer is needed to estimate the states from the trajectories of measured variables. While model-based observer synthesis is traditionally challenging due to the difficulty of solving pertinent partial differential equations, this article proposes an efficient model-free, data-driven approach for state observation, which is suitable for data-driven nonlinear control without accurate nonlinear models. Specifically, by using a Chen-Fliess series representation of the observer dynamics, state observation is endowed with an online least squares regression formulation that can be solved by gradient flow with performance guarantees. When the target state trajectories for regression are unavailable, by exploiting the Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger observer structure, state observation is reduced to a dimensionality reduction problem amenable to an online implementation of kernel principal component analysis. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a limit cycle dynamics and a chaotic system.

Finding predictive indicators of EBV infection is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of EBV infection-related diseases by suggesting a dose reduction of immunosuppressant.Methods: We compared and analysed the gut microbiome of EBV-infected children with an asymptomatic virus-carrying status and EBV-uninfected children after liver transplantation using high-throughput sequencing.Results: Significant differences in gut microbiome composition in two groups were detected. In detail, Firmicutes and Lactobacillus were increased in EBV-infected group, while Clostridium was increased in EBV-uninfected group. Furthermore, CD4 percentage in T cells of blood showed a significant positive correlation with the content of Clostridium sp. CAG: 127 in EBV-uninfected group.Conclusion: Changes in the gut microbiome could predict and decrease the EBV infection risk of children after liver transplantation. image	[Wang, Xu; Li, Peng; Zhang, Shutian] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Friendship Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Liying] Capital Med Univ, Beijing Friendship Hosp, Dept Liver Transplantat, Beijing, Peoples R China	Capital Medical University; Capital Medical University	Li, P; Zhang, ST (corresponding author), Capital Med Univ, Beijing Friendship Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Beijing, Peoples R China.	lipeng@ccmu.edu.cn; zhangshutian@ccmu.edu.cn							17	0	0	1	1	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1398-2273	1399-3062		TRANSPL INFECT DIS	Transpl.

To address this issue in the emerged nitrogen/carbonyl MR-TADF system, we propose a spiro-lock strategy. By incorporating spiro functionalization into a concise molecular skeleton, a series of emitters (SFQ, SOQ, SSQ, and SSeQ) can enhance molecular rigidity, blue-shift the emission peak, narrow the emission band, increase the photoluminescence quantum yield by over 92 %, and suppress intermolecular interactions in the film state. The referent CZQ without spiro structure has a more planar skeleton, and its bluer emission in the solution state redshifts over 40 nm with serious spectrum broadening and a low PLQY in the film state. As a result, SSQ achieves an external quantum efficiency of 25.5 % with a peak at 456 nm and a small full width at half maximum of 31 nm in a simple unsensitized device, significantly outperforming CZQ. This work discloses the importance of spiro-junction in modulating deep-blue MR-TADF emitters.

However, it remains unclear how a country's transition from a modernized male breadwinner regime that supports maternal care to family policies that promote maternal employment and paternal caregiving change couples' gender-typical division of housework in the long run.Method: We use representative survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1994-2019, N = 14,648) and estimate the re-traditionalization effect of childbirth on mothers' absolute and relative time-use on housework over four policy periods with linear fixed-effects regression models.Results: Across all periods, mothers took on larger absolute and relative levels of housework after childbirth, with a more pronounced and persistent gender-typical division in West than in East Germany. However, mothers spent somewhat less absolute and relative time on housework in recent periods with stronger levels of de-familiarizing and dual-earner/dual-carer policies than in earlier periods with policies supporting maternal caregiving.Conclusion: We find somewhat smaller and less persistent re-traditionalization effects of childbirth in more supportive work-family policy periods. In sum, the small changes illustrate that even in contexts of enormous policy change, progress toward a less gender-typical division of housework has been slow and rather small.

Indeed, as recently reviewed, the term 'norm' in anatomy can be considered an approximation. Thus, anatomical variations occur quite often, as largely demonstrated during non-invasive diagnosis, surgical intervention, or post mortem investigations. In the present study, we describe different anatomical variations in both the right and left lungs derived from cadavers of different ethnicities. The analysed organs were collected during dissection, and accessory lobes and fissures were observed in both the right and left lungs. Moreover, a horizontal fissure was missing from the right lung, resulting in only two lobes. Since lung anatomical variability is common in clinical practice and preclinical imaging studies can miss different morphologies, a deep and accurate knowledge of the anatomical variations of the lung is of extreme importance to avoid difficulties or changes during the surgical procedure.

However, transport in such polymeric pores is increasingly hindered as the molecule size approaches the pore dimension, resulting in significant retention of undesirable middle molecules (>= 15-60 kDa) and uremic toxins. Enhanced removal of middle molecules is usually accompanied by high albumin loss (approximate to 66 kDa) causing hypoalbuminemia. Here, the scalable bottom-up fabrication of wafer-scale carbon nanotube (CNT) membranes with highly aligned, low-friction, straight-channels/capillaries and narrow pore-diameter distributions (approximate to 0.5-4.5 nm) is demonstrated, to overcome persistent challenges in hemofiltration/hemodialysis. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Ficoll 70 and albumin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as well as in bovine blood plasma, it is shown that CNT membranes can allow for significantly higher hydraulic permeability (more than an order of magnitude when normalized to pore area) than commercial high-flux hemofiltration/hemodialysis membranes (HF 400), as well as greatly enhance removal of middle molecules while maintaining comparable albumin retention. These findings are rationalized via an N-pore transport model that highlights the critical role of molecular flexing and deformation during size-selective transport within nanoscale confinements of the CNTs. The unique transport characteristics of CNTs coupled with size-exclusion and wafer-scale fabrication offer transformative advances for hemofiltration, and the obtained insight into molecular transport can aid advancements in several other bio-systems/applications beyond hemofiltration/hemodialysis.

Species delimitation have long been based on phylogenetic analyses of a small number of standard markers, but accurate lineage identification through this approach can be hampered by incomplete lineage sorting, introgression or isolation by distance. In that context, analyses of introgression patterns at secondary contact zones offer an interesting alternative by allowing a direct estimation of reproductive isolation, especially when using genome-wide markers. Here, we investigated a contact zone between two genetic groups of the Spiny-footed Lizard Acanthodactylus erythrurus (Schinz, 1833) in Morocco, whose status as separate lineages remained disputed in previous multilocus studies. Based on thousands of genome-wide markers obtained through a RADseq approach, we confirmed that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages. Furthermore, the transition at their contact zone was very steep, with spatially restricted gene flow, highlighting levels of reproductive isolation consistent with species-level lineages. Our study further illustrates the power of RADseq-based studies of contact zones to understand cryptic diversity in non-model organisms.

Influence of social rank on the development of long-term ethanol drinking trajectories in cynomolgus monkeys	ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						alcohol use disorder; nonhuman primate; social dominance; social stress	ALCOHOL-USE; SUBORDINATION STRESS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PRIMATE MODELS; DEPENDENCE; ONSET; AGE; DETERMINANTS; BEHAVIOR; CORTISOL	Background Chronic stress contribute to the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, characterizing the role of chronic social stressors in the development of problematic drinking trajectories in humans is complicated by practical and ethical constraints. Group-housed nonhuman primates develop social dominance hierarchies that represent a continuum of social experiences from enrichment in higher-ranked (dominant) monkeys to chronic social stress in lower-ranked (subordinate) individuals. This framework provides a translationally relevant model of chronic social stress that can be used to characterize its effects on vulnerability to AUD.Methods Twelve male cynomolgus monkeys living in three social groups with established social dominance hierarchies were provided access to ethanol and water for 22 h/day, 4-5 days/week, for 1 year. Ethanol-free periods (2- or 3-day "weekends" or longer periods up to 10 days) were spent in social groups to maintain the stability of the social hierarchies. Observational studies conducted 6 months into the year of drinking assessed signs of ethanol withdrawal. After 1 year, monkeys were individually housed 24 h/day, 7 days/week for four consecutive weeks to examine the effect of eliminating the "weekends" spent socially housed.Results Subordinate monkeys had significantly higher mean daily ethanol intakes than dominant monkeys across 1 year of open access. Subordinates also had higher intakes on the first day back drinking following ethanol-free periods of 9-10 days. Moreover, during the last 4 weeks of open access, intakes on the first drinking day after an ethanol-free weekend increased significantly in subordinate monkeys. This effect diminished when all monkeys were individually housed for 4 weeks, indicating that the increased intake in subordinates was driven by the social environment.Conclusions These data demonstrate that social subordination, which is associated with chronic social stress, results in increased vulnerability to the development and maintenance of heavy drinking trajectories.

We attempted to assess whether the alterations in the composition of CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells are different between AS and RA and identify the characteristic cells between male and female patients.Methods The proportions of CD3+ or double positive T cells, 6 CD4(+) T subsets and 9 CD8(+) T cell subsets were detected by flow cytometry and compared in 30 healthy individuals, 42 AS patients and 45 RA patients. The differentially altered cells were individually analyzed for associations with disease activity parameters. In addition, their proportions were compared between different genders in the 3 groups.Results The proportions of CD4(+) T cells, naive CD4(+) T cells and central memory CD4(+) T cells were lower in AS patients (P = 0.001, P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively) and RA patients (P = 0.032, P < 0.001 and P = 0.016, respectively), but the proportion of effector memory ones was higher when compared with healthy populations (both P < 0.001), as were the decrease of naive/central memory CD8(+) T cells in AS (P = 0.003 and P = 0.016, respectively) and RA (P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively), and the increased tendency of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells. However, these above-mentioned cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells and CD8(+) T cells with different CD127 expressions between AS and RA were similar in proportion. Furthermore, naive CD4(+)T cells were positively associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) in AS, whereas CD4(+) T cells and terminally differentiated CD8(+) T of RA patients were associated with CRP in RA. The gender-related alterations predominantly displayed the overexpressions of Treg cells and naive CD8+ T cells in female patients with AS and RA, respectively.Conclusions AS patients and RA patients have some similar peripheral CD4(+)/CD8(+)T cell subsets but are distinct from healthy individuals, which may contribute to disease severity. Females are respectively characterized by the up-regulation of Treg cells and naive CD8(+) T cells in AS patients and RA patients. The study offers an in-depth understanding of the role of T cell subsets in the similarities of the disorders and helps us to monitor disease changes and may offer a theoretical basis of developing novel therapies against common targets.

The causative agent is the Rhabdovirus carpio or SVC virus (SVCV), a member of the Sprivivirus genus, within the Rhabdoviridae family. Phylogenetically, SVCV is divided into four genogroups (SVCV a, SVCV b, SVCV c and SVCV d), which have a reasonable correlation with the geographical distribution of the virus. In the late twentieth century, the disease was widespread in Serbian aquaculture and caused massive deaths in common carp. This study aimed to molecularly characterize the circulating SVCV isolates in Serbia over a 17-year period. The genetic relationships between 21 SVCV isolates from common carp and rainbow trout in Serbia between 1992 and 2009 were determined based on the partial nucleotide sequence of the glycoprotein gene (G gene). The phylogenetic analysis showed that the dominant SVCV isolates in Serbia belong to the SVCV d genogroup, with only one isolate belonging to genogroup SVCV b. The SVCV strains circulating in Serbia exhibited high homogeneity, as several isolates shared 100% similarity within these genogroups. Most Serbian isolates belonged to SVCV d1 and d2 subgroups, with one isolate notably different and included in a new subgroup SVCV d5. Understanding the SVCV genetic variants circulating in Serbia would be helpful in future epizootic investigations.

Matrix nanotopography and external forces, such as electromagnetic fields (EMF), can enhance this stimulation. Here, it is demonstrated that biophysical multiple cues coordinated from electromagnetized Au-nanoparticles-decorated polymer nanofiber under EMF significantly regulate the adhesion, alignment, proliferation, and lineage commitment of hMSCs. Without EMF, matrix cues of electrical conductivity and nanodotted fibrous topography accelerate the anchorage and spreading of hMSCs. Of note, EMF synergizes with the matrix cues to enhance cellular behaviors, resulting in elongated and aligned cells along the field direction. Microtubules are highly polymerized, acetylated, and aligned, playing an active role in these events. Actin filaments also develop in parallel with the microtubules, facilitating actin-microtubule crosstalks. These phenomena lead to changes in the nuclear mechanics of hMSCs, including elongated nuclear shape and decondensed chromatins with histone acetylation. The EMF+matrix-stimulated hMSCs express genes related to microtubule organization and euchromatin, as revealed by RNA sequencing, and show chromatin accessibility with enrichment of genes related to mechanotransduction and lineage specification, as analyzed by ATAC sequencing. The EMF+matrix biophysical stimulation further increases the capacity for lineage specification (predominantly towards osteogenic, myogenic, and tenogenic), offering a promising bioengineering platform for stem cell engineering and therapies. The biophysical cues coordinated from P@Au nanotopographical matrix and electromagnetic field regulate the adhesion, alignment, and lineage specification of mesenchymal stem cells. The cytoskeletal-to-nuclear mechanotransduction process demonstrates the activated cellular events and underlying mechanisms.image	[Singh, Rajendra K.; Kurian, Amal George; Sagar, Varsha; Park, Ilyong; Park, Jeong-Hui; Lee, Hwalim; Lee, Jung-Hwan; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, Inst Tissue Regenerat Engn ITREN, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Singh, Rajendra K.; Kurian, Amal George; Sagar, Varsha; Park, Ilyong; Lee, Jung-Hwan; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, Ctr Regenerat Med, Dept Nanobiomed Sci & NBM Global Res BK21, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Park, Ilyong] Dankook Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Engn, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Park, Jeong-Hui; Lee, Hwalim; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, UCL Eastman Korea Dent Med Innovat Ctr, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Lee, Hwalim; Lee, Jung-Hwan; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Biomat Sci, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Lee, Jung-Hwan; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Regenerat Dent Med, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Lee, Jung-Hwan; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, Cell & Matter Inst, Cheonan 31116, South Korea; [Lee, Jung-Hwan; Kim, Hae-Won] Dankook Univ, Mechanobiol Dent Med Res Ctr, Cheonan 31116, South Korea	Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University; Dankook University	Singh, RK; Lee, JH; Kim, HW (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Inst Tissue Regenerat Engn ITREN, Cheonan 31116, South Korea.	rajendra@dankook.ac.kr; ducious@dankook.ac.kr; kimhw@dku.edu			This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants, Republic of Korea (2021R1A5A2022318, 2018K1A4A3A01064257, 2019R1A6A1A11034536, 2018R1A2B3003446, RS-2023-00247485) and Dankook University (Priority Institute Support Program in [2021R1A5A2022318, 2018K1A4A3A01064257, 2019R1A6A1A11034536, 2018R1A2B3003446, RS-2023-00247485]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants, Republic of Korea [2023]; Dankook University (Priority Institute Support Program in 2022)	This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants, Republic of Korea (2021R1A5A2022318, 2018K1A4A3A01064257, 2019R1A6A1A11034536, 2018R1A2B3003446, RS-2023-00247485) and Dankook University (Priority Institute Support Program in; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants, Republic of Korea; Dankook University (Priority Institute Support Program in 2022)	This work was supported by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants, Republic of Korea (2021R1A5A2022318, 2018K1A4A3A01064257, 2019R1A6A1A11034536, 2018R1A2B3003446, RS-2023-00247485) and Dankook University (Priority Institute Support Program in 2022 and 2023, DREAM scientist Program)		92	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1616-301X	1616-3028		ADV FUNCT MATER	Adv.

J	Sefcik, JS; Hathaway, Z; DiMaria-Ghalili, RA				Sefcik, Justine S.; Hathaway, Zachary; DiMaria-Ghalili, Rose Ann			When snowball sampling leads to an avalanche of fraudulent participants in qualitative research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING			English	Editorial Material						fraud; interviews; recruitment; research participant registry	INTERVIEWS	Background: Fraudulent research participants create negative consequences for the rigour and soundness of research. Aims: A case study is presented from a qualitative study where the research team believed several fraudulent participants fabricated information during an interview about being a caregiver for a person living with dementia and chronic wounds. Materials & Methods: Participants were recruited through a free online research registry. Individual semi-structured interviews were held virtually. Results: The study was paused after the nurse scientist with qualitative methodology experience identified that participants were giving illogical and repetitive responses across interviews. The team developed a revised screening tool to help reduce fraudulent participants from enrolling in the study. None of the data collected were used for analysis. Discussion: Information is provided on how the team dealt with the situation, lessons learned for future studies, and recommendations for gerontological nurse researchers. Conclusion: Researchers should be aware that some participants are misrepresenting themselves for financial incentives and this can compromise the soundness of findings. Thorough screening tools are one way to identify and prevent fraud.

Cerviva Irish Cervical Screening	Performance of the HPV E6/E7 mRNA Aptima HPV assay combined with partial genotyping compared with the HPV DNA Cobas 4800 HPV test for use in primary screening: Results from the CERVIVA HPV primary screening study in Ireland	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article; Early Access						genotyping; HPV DNA; HPV mRNA; screening	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS ASSAYS; COLPOSCOPY; WOMEN; DISTRESS; CYTOLOGY	There are currently several validated HPV tests. However, longitudinal data which spans appropriate age ranges, as well as evaluation of potential screening algorithms are necessary for screening programmes choice of test. The objective of our study was to evaluate the performance of HPV mRNA and HPV DNA testing, including partial genotyping, in routine cervical screening. As part of the CERVIVA HPV Primary Screening Study, ThinPrep samples from 10 150 women were tested for HPV mRNA using the Aptima HPV assay and HPV DNA using the Cobas 4800 HPV test. HPV mRNA-positive women were further assessed with the Aptima genotyping assay for HPV 16/18/45. Baseline cytology and prospective follow-up data were collected. The performance of the two tests was examined over 42 months (to date). HPV mRNA demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to HPV DNA testing for detection of CIN2+ (93.2% [92.4-93.9] vs 92.8% [92.0-93.6], respectively) and CIN3+ (94.6% [93.8-95.3] vs 94.6% [93.8-95.3]). HPV mRNA testing had significantly higher specificity compared to HPV DNA for detection of CIN2+ (84.0% [83.5-84.5] vs 80.8% [80.2-81.4], respectively) and CIN3+ (88.44% [88.2-88.6] vs 85.62 [85.4-85.9]). The proportion of CIN2+ and CIN3+, over 3 years (42 months), in HPV-negative women was comparable for both RNA (0.20% and 0.10%) and DNA (0.22% and 0.11%). Genotyping data was comparable across both assay platforms. In the context of HPV primary screening HPV mRNA testing has potential to reduce triage tests and follow-up tests at 12 months compared to DNA testing, with no significant difference in detection of CIN2+ and CIN3+.

J	Ping-Kuo, C; Yong, Y				Ping-Kuo, Chen; Yong, Ye			Realizing environmental sustainability development through the efficiency of Web 3.0 on supply chain resilience	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						green supply chain; supply chain resilience; sustainable development; Web 3.0	PERCEIVED VALUE; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; ANTECEDENTS	Limited research has addressed the potential of Web 3.0 to facilitate the green supply chain and support sustainable development goals. Although some studies have suggested the efficiency of Web 3.0 in promoting a green supply chain, lack empirical evidence explaining how this efficiency is generated remains scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate this matter. By drawing upon relevant literature and leveraging the natural resource-based view, a conceptual model is constructed and validated using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The analysis reveals that Web 3.0 can foster the formation of consensual thinking through its decentralized mechanism. This, in turn, enables firms to generate perceived value based on the efficiency of consensual thinking, leading to an increased intention to build mutual trust and facilitate green knowledge sharing among firms. Furthermore, the controllability provided by a permissioned mechanism enhances information security, guiding mutual trust among firms to evolve into trustless cooperation. As a result, firms exhibit full trust in each other, facilitating smoother green knowledge sharing. The influence of mutual trust and trustless cooperation in promoting green knowledge sharing contributes to the resilience of the supply chain and ultimately leads to superior green performance, contributing to environmentally sustainable development. This study provides valuable insights into the integration of the green supply chain and Web 3.0, filling a gap in the existing literature.

Naturally occurring variability in larval period length is associated with intraspecific differences in late tadpoles of a South American true toad	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						metamorphosis; anuran; interrenal gland; larval period length; developmental plasticity; Rhinella arenarum; life-history traits; morphological variability	POST-METAMORPHIC MORPHOLOGY; SEROUS CUTANEOUS GLANDS; LIFE-HISTORY; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; TRITURUS-CARNIFEX; INTERRENAL GLAND; BRAIN PLASTICITY; BUFO-BOREAS; ANURA	The larval period in anurans is highly plastic. Even though larval period length and larval size have been the most studied characteristics showing intraspecific variability, other features such as morphology, behavior, food preferences and physiology have also been described as plastic. Metamorphic changes are triggered by thyroid and interrenal hormones, and environmental signals modulate the onset of metamorphosis via the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis. The South American bufonid toad Rhinella arenarum from nearby Buenos Aires City has a larval period of 30-120 days under the same environmental conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate life-history traits in tadpoles from different localities and potential morphological differences among tadpoles with different larval period length. For this purpose, we reared under natural conditions tadpoles from two different localities nearby Buenos Aires City and in three different years measured their size at the end of metamorphosis and recorded their larval period length. The external appearance, histo-morphology and morphometry of the skin and kidney/interrenal complex were studied in metamorphs with short and long larval periods (SLP and LLP, respectively). We observed a larval period lasting 30-120 days in tadpoles from different localities or years. SLP metamorphs were smaller, darker, had less protruding eyes without eyelids, a thinner epidermis and fewer skin glands than LLP metamorphs. The secretion of skin glands from SLP tadpoles had acidic glycoconjugates. Kidney size was similar between LLP and SLP metamorphs, but the former had an adult-like histomorphology. Interrenal gland in LLP early and late climax tadpoles had cells with a high nucleus/cell diameter ratio, a sign of highly active steroidogenic cells. Overall, these results show that intraspecific variability in size, skin and interrenal gland development is associated with differences in larval period length. Distinct skin gland number and secretion, along with distinct interrenal histology at late climax, could have physiological consequences in the post-metamorphic life.	[Regueira, E.; Novarin, M.

Results of a UK workshop discussing the regulation of knowledge libraries and software as a medical device	LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						computable knowledge; knowledge libraries; learning health systems; medical device regulation; mobilising computable biomedical knowledge		Introduction: To understand when knowledge objects in a computable biomedical knowledge library are likely to be subject to regulation as a medical device in the United Kingdom.Methods: A briefing paper was circulated to a multi-disciplinary group of 25 including regulators, lawyers and others with insights into device regulation. A 1-day workshop was convened to discuss questions relating to our aim. A discussion paper was drafted by lead authors and circulated to other authors for their comments and contributions.Results: This article reports on those deliberations and describes how UK device regulators are likely to treat the different kinds of knowledge objects that may be stored in computable biomedical knowledge libraries. While our focus is the likely approach of UK regulators, our analogies and analysis will also be relevant to the approaches taken by regulators elsewhere. We include a table examining the implications for each of the four knowledge levels described by Boxwala in 2011 and propose an additional level.Conclusions: If a knowledge object is described as directly executable for a medical purpose to provide decision support, it will generally be in scope of UK regulation as "software as a medical device." However, if the knowledge object consists of an algorithm, a ruleset, pseudocode or some other representation that is not directly executable and whose developers make no claim that it can be used for a medical purpose, it is not likely to be subject to regulation. We expect similar reasoning to be applied by regulators in other countries.

However, a comprehensive safety profile of JAK inhibitors in patients with atopic dermatitis has not been analysed. This study aimed to establish clinical evidence for the safety of systemic JAK inhibitors in patients with atopic dermatitis. Medline, Embase, , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were considered for search databases. Randomized controlled trials reporting the adverse events of systemic therapy in patients with atopic dermatitis were included. The risk of 11 adverse events was compared between the JAK inhibitors and placebo groups. Fourteen randomized controlled trials were analysed published between 2019 and 2022. The JAK inhibitors included in the analysis were abrocitinib (10, 30, 100 and 200 mg), baricitinib (1, 2 and 4 mg) and upadacitinib (7.5, 15 and 30 mg). The risk of herpes zoster, headache, acne, elevated blood creatinine phosphokinase and nausea was significantly increased, but the risk of serious infection, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), malignancies other than NMSC, major adverse cardiovascular event, venous thromboembolism and nasopharyngitis was not increased. This study provides comprehensive clinical evidence on the risk of various adverse events in patients with atopic dermatitis. However, since the follow-up periods of the studies analysed in this review were mostly limited to 16 weeks or less, it is recommended that comprehensive long-term observational studies be conducted to determine any potential adverse events associated with major cardiovascular events or malignancies, which typically have prolonged courses.

We hypothesized that the tested polymorphism has significant associations with functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) independent from comorbid depression.Methods: Seventy patients with functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks), 70 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 70 healthy controls (HCs) were studied. Their DNAs were analyzed for NR3C1 rs41423247 polymorphism.Results: Genotype and allele frequencies of rs41423247 were different between the three groups. G allele carriers were more frequent in patients with functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) and those with MDD compared to HCs (p = 0.0001). However no significant difference was observed with respect to allele distributions between functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) and MDD groups (p = 0.391). CC genotype was less often associated with functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) versus HC: Codominant model; p = 0.001, OR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.05-0.24, and -2loglilkelihood = 231.7. In comparison between functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) group and other (MDD + HC) groups, we observed a significant association between CG genotype and functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) (Codominant model; p = 0.001, OR = 5.63, 95% CI = 2.60-12.40 and -2loglikelihood = 245.99).Significance: Patients with functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) and those with MDD were significantly more often G allele carriers in rs41423247 compared with HCs. We observed a significant association between CG genotype and functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks). However, we could not exclude the possibility of confounding effects of depression. Future genetic studies of patients with functional seizures (psychogenic nonepileptic seizures/attacks) should include a comparison group with depression in addition to a comparison group of HCs.

Currently, there is no fully satisfactory reference method for this quantification. In our previous study, we compared the commonly used overview estimation method (method A) with a novel method for counting plasma cells in three representative areas (method B). Results showed comparable concordance parameters between the two methods. In this follow-up study, we compared the previously evaluated methods with a digital analysis method (method C) that uses artificial intelligence in open-source software, QuPath.Methods: Archived CD138 immunohistochemically stained trephine sections of bone marrow samples used in our previous study were used (n = 33). Reviewers selected three representative areas on each sample by taking images with a light microscope and camera. Digital analysis was performed using the positive cell detection function in QuPath. The entire process was repeated by each reviewer to test intraobserver concordance (concordance correlation coefficient [CCC]) in addition to interobserver concordance (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]).Results: Intraobserver concordance of method C showed strong agreement for all reviewers with the lowest CCC = 0.854. Interobserver concordance for method C using ICC was 0.909 and 0.949. This showed high interobserver agreement with significant differences between method C and previously assessed method A (ICC = 0.793 and 0.713) and method B (ICC = 0.657 and 0.658).Conclusion: We were able to successfully count CD138-positive plasma cells in bone marrow biopsies using artificial intelligence. This method is superior to both manual counting and overview estimation, regardless of tumour load.

Craniometric studies are performed with various imaging methods to deter- mine morphometric characteristics in animals. One of these methods is radiogra- phy. In our study, skulls of 14 Hamdani sheep, 20 Siirt-coloured mohair goats and 20 Romanov sheep breeds were used. Skull sections were taken with a computed tomog- raphy device and saved in DICOM format. Nine separate measurements and six index calculations were made from the images. In the study, firstly, the gender difference was ignored and the similarities and differences between the species were recorded. In addition, gender differences were determined statistically, without making any distinction between species. Correlation analysis was performed to compare meas- urement parameters between animal species. As a result of the study, the highest skull length (SL) and cranial length (CL) values were determined in the Siirt-coloured mohair goat. It was determined that the difference between Romanov sheep and Siirt-coloured mohair goat in CL parameter was not statistically significant (p> 0.05). In ad- dition, a statistically significant difference was observed between the Romanov sheep breed and the Hamdani sheep breed (p < 0.01). The external length of the cranium (ELC) measurement parameter was found to have a statistically significant difference in three animals (p < 0.01). According to the results of the correlation analysis, the highest correlation value was determined between cranial width (CW) and CL param- eters (r= 0.920). When the species difference was ignored, and the statistical differ- ence of the internal height of the cranium (IHC) parameter was found to be significant between female and male animals (p < 0.05). In addition, it was determined that SL, CW and internal cranium index (ICI) parameters had a significant difference depend- ing on sex (p < 0.01). It is foreseen that the obtained data can be used in sciences such as zoo archaeology, anatomy, surgery and forensic medicine.

Search strategy was peer-reviewed by medical librarians. Studies were included if they utilized airway sampling, non-type 2 cytokines, and patients with CRS and lower airway disease.ResultsTwenty-seven from 7060 articles were included. In patients with CRS and comorbid asthma, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/bronchiectasis, 60% (n = 12), 33% (n = 2), and 100% (n = 1), respectively, demonstrated mixed or non-type 2 endotypes. Comorbid CRS and asthma produced type 1 (n = 1.5), type 2 (n = 8), type 3 (n = 1), mixed type 1/2 (n = 1), and mixed type 1/2/3 (n = 8.5) endotype shifts. AERD demonstrated type 2 (n = 4), mixed type 2/3 (n = 1), and mixed type 1/2/3 (n = 1) endotype shifts. CRS with COPD or bronchiectasis demonstrated a mixed 1/2 (n = 1) endotype shift.ConclusionType 2 disease has been extensively reviewed due to advent biologics targeting type 2 inflammation, but outcomes may be suboptimal due to the presence of non-type 2 inflammation. A proportion of patients with CRS and comorbid lower airway disease demonstrated mixed and non-type 2 endotype shifts. This emphasizes that patients with unified airway disease may have forms of inflammation beyond classical type 2 disease which could inform biologic development. Laryngoscope, 2023 Chronic rhinosinusitis (sinusitis) is an inflammatory disorder with multiple underlying aberrant inflammatory pathways. Patients with sinusitis and a lower airway disease have mixed inflammation or isolated type 1, 2 or 3 inflammation.image	[Heffernan, Austin; Shafiee, Amir; Chan, Teffran; Sparanese, Sydney; Thamboo, Andrew] Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Thamboo, Andrew] Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 2775 Laurel St,4th Floor, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada	University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia	Thamboo, A (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Surg, Div Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, 2775 Laurel St,4th Floor, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.	andrew.thamboo@gmail.com		Heffernan, Austin/0000-0001-5086-9220	We acknowledge Dr. Ximena Maul Fonseca for assistance with administrative tasks.

The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of the approval of home administration of misoprostol in England on access to medical abortion, assessed through proxy measures of the proportion of all abortions that were medical and gestational age.Methods: This study uses the clinical data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service on abortions in England in years 2018-2019, containing demographic and procedure characteristics of patients. We conducted an interrupted time series analysis to establish the differences before and after the approval in access to medical abortion, measured by the proportion of all abortions that were medical, and gestational age. The analysis also examined whether these changes were equitable, with focus on area-level deprivation.Results: The analysis of the data (145 529 abortions) suggested that there was an increase in the proportion of medical abortions and decrease in gestational age of abortions after the approval. Compared with the situation if former trends had continued, the actual proportion of early medical abortions was 4.2% higher in December 2019, and the mean gestational age 3.4 days lower. We found that the acceleration of existing trends in increase in proportion of medical abortions and decrease in gestational age were larger in the most deprived quintiles and in those reporting a disability, but not equal across ethnic groups, with Black and Black British women experiencing little change in trajectories post-approval.Conclusion: The approval of home use of misoprostol as part of an early medical abortion regimen in England was associated with material and equitable improvements in abortion access. Pre-approval trends toward greater uptake of medical abortion and declining gestational age were accelerated post-approval and were greatest in the most deprived areas of England, but not across all racial/ethnic groups. The present findings strongly support the continuation or introduction of home management of medical abortions.

Bulk and Surface Contributions to Ionisation Potentials of Metal Oxides	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						Ceria; Ionization Potential; Metal Oxides; QM/MM; Surface Chemistry	CERIA CATALYSTS; CEO2(001); ENERGIES; EXCHANGE; PROGRAM; STATES; MODEL	Determining the absolute band edge positions in solid materials is crucial for optimising their performance in wide-ranging applications including photocatalysis and electronic devices. However, obtaining absolute energies is challenging, as seen in CeO2, where experimental measurements show substantial discrepancies in the ionisation potential (IP). Here, we have combined several theoretical approaches, from classical electrostatics to quantum mechanics, to elucidate the bulk and surface contributions to the IP of metal oxides. We have determined a theoretical bulk contribution to the IP of stoichiometric CeO2 of only 5.38 eV, while surface orientation results in intrinsic IP variations ranging from 4.2 eV to 8.2 eV. Highly tuneable IPs were also found in TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, in which surface polarisation plays a pivotal role in long-range energy level shifting. Our analysis, in addition to rationalising the observed range of experimental results, provides a firm basis for future interpretations of experimental and computational studies of oxide band structures.

However, breeder age has an effect on eggs. There is no detailed study on the changes in mineral levels in eggs and bones of these effects. Therefore, the aim of this study examines how mineral levels of shell, albumen, egg yolk, and bone, embryonic development and bone characteristics change according to the breeder age. A total of 370 fresh hatching eggs were obtained from Ross-308 breeders at 2 different ages (25 to 60-week-old). Egg, embryo, yolk sac and chick characteristics were determined. Morphometric parameters of bones of embryos at 19 days of age and chicks at hatch were examined. Mineral levels of albumen, yolk, shell and bones of embryo and chick were determined. Egg weight, embryo weight, embryo length, chick weight and chick length were higher in old breeder than those of younger one. Femur length, width and Seedor index of tibia, weight, width and Seedor index of metatarsus were found to be high in embryos at 19 days of old breeder than young breeder. There were differences in relative femur weight, tibia length and relative metatarsus weight of chicks at hatch. The mineral levels were high in the femur, tibia and metatarsus of embryos and chicks, in parts of the egg of old breeder. K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe and Mn levels in the eggshell were decreased during incubation. Ca and Mg levels were decreased in the yolk during incubation. K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Zn and Mn levels were found to be high in chick bones than those of bones of embryos at 19 days of age. The total embryonic death was found to be high in the fertile eggs of younger breeder group. No differences were observed in fertility, hatchability of fertile and set eggs according to the age of breeders. These data may be useful in designing in-ovo injections, formulating diets of broiler breeders and broilers and in preventing bone diseases in broilers.

For most ferroelectrics, however, the small photorefractive effect (10(-5)-10(-4)) hinders their practical application and it is urgent to exploit new photorefractive system. Here, for the first time, strong photorefractive effects are achieved in a 2D metal-halide ferroelectric, [CH3(CH2)(3)NH3](2)(CH3NH3)Pb2Cl7 (1), showing large spontaneous polarization (approximate to 4.1 mu C cm(-2)) and wide optical bandgap (approximate to 3.20 eV). Notably, under light irradiation, 1 enables a large variation of refractive indices up to approximate to 1x 10(-3), being one order higher than the existing materials and comparable to the state-of-the-art inorganic ferroelectrics. This intriguing photorefractive behavior involves with the sharp variation of polarization caused by photo-pyroelectricity. As the first report of 2D metal-halide photorefractive ferroelectric, this work sheds light on optical controlling of physical properties in electric-ordered materials.

Currently, many industrial sourced chemicals are used as additives to improve the mixing stability of dough. This study aims to evaluate the effect of adding chickpea flour on mixing tolerance and dough strength improvement based on 20 different wheat genotypes. The effects of different types (i.e., kabuli and desi) and amounts (1.5%, 3.75%, 7.5%, 15%, and 30%, w/w) of chickpea flours and kabuli chickpea fractions (7.5%) were further studied. Mixograph, dough strength and extensibility, and baking test of selected treatments were performed. FindingsIncorporating chickpea flour at a level of 7.5% (w/w flour basis) or lower significantly improved (p < .05) the mixing stability and dough strength of different wheat flours. Adding the insoluble fraction of the chickpea flour resulted in better stability and dough strength compared to other fractions, while adding the soluble fraction of chickpea flour weakened the dough. At the optimum incorporation level (7.5%) or lower, the inclusion of chickpea flour did not negatively alter the physical (bread volume), texture (hardness), or taste attributes of the bread. ConclusionThe results demonstrate that adding chickpea flour can improve dough mixing properties, particularly for weak/normal wheat flour, without compromising the quality of bread. The optimal chickpea flour incorporation level in refined wheat flour is 7.5%. Chickpea flour incorporation could also assist bakers in case of overmixing the dough. Significance and NoveltyThis study portrays the use of natural ingredients to improve dough mixing properties, providing bakers and scientific community with natural alternatives to enhance wheat flour mixing properties while improving the quality and nutrition of the flour as chickpea is a protein-rich legume.

The fabrication of steep-slope FET (subthreshold swing < 60mVdec-1) is reported, followed by modeling approaches. While the device fabrication favors a ferroelectric gate structure without interlayer metal, many NCFET models adopt interlayer metal between the ferroelectric layer and metal-insulator-semiconductor structure. The metal interlayer averages out spatial variation in the ferroelectric polarization, enabling a compact charge-based relation between the layers. In addition, the approach assumes that the NC effect emerges from the ferroelectric layer regardless of the metal interlayer, which is not necessarily probable. This work reinvestigates the possible NC effect in ferroelectric-dielectric capacitors connected by a metal interlayer. The experiment confirms that the NC effect in the metal-ferroelectric-dielectric-metal structure does not appear in the metal-ferroelectric-metal-dielectric-metal structure. These results are inconsistent with the multidomain-1D Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire model. In contrast, the suppression of the NC effect in the structure is fully explained by the advanced inhomogeneous stray-field energy model, which simulates the dynamic evolution of polarization and screening charges. Therefore, an NCFET with a metal interlayer is impractical.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of OM on SWVS and sorption hysteresis for different a(w) levels. We measured water sorption isotherms and physicochemical properties of eight soils with varying clay (6%-47%) and OM (2.0%-7.8%) contents before and after OM removal. In general, OM increased SWVS, but the effect of OM on SWVS varied for different a(w) ranges. The presence of OM generally increased water vapor sorption during the adsorption process. For soils with OM content above 4.6%, the presence of OM decreased water vapor sorption during the condensation process. The local hysteresis (H-w) of soils with OM was higher than that of soils without OM for soils with OM contents above 3.4%. For a(w) < & SIM;0.75, the water vapor sorption hysteresis of soils with and without OM showed a significant correlation with cation exchange capacity (CEC), and the H-w values of soils with OM were lower than that of soils without OM for the same CEC. The OM can affect water vapor sorption and the associated hysteresis at low a(w) levels through adsorbed cations and organic functional groups, and at high a(w) levels through the structures of pores and OM.

Yet, the key physiological and structural traits underlying its stress-adapted lifestyle are unknown along with trade-offs when surviving salt stress at the expense of growth and reproduction. We aimed to identify the influential adaptive trait responses that lead to stress-resilient and uncompromised growth across developmental stages when treated with salt at levels known to inhibit growth in Arabidopsis and most crops. Its resilient growth was promoted by traits that synergistically allowed primary root growth in seedlings, the expansion of xylem vessels across the root-shoot continuum, and a high capacity to maintain tissue water levels by developing thicker succulent leaves while enabling photosynthesis during salt stress. A successful transition from vegetative to reproductive phase was initiated by salt-induced early flowering, resulting in viable seeds. Self-fertilization in salt-induced early flowering was dependent upon filament elongation in flowers otherwise aborted in the absence of salt during comparable plant ages. The maintenance of leaf water status promoting growth, and early flowering to ensure reproductive success in a changing environment, were among the most influential traits that contributed to the extremophytic lifestyle of S. parvula.

Abnormal bolus reflux on impedance-pH testing independently predicts 3-year pulmonary outcome and mortality in pulmonary fibrosis	JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						aspiration; extra-esophageal reflux; gastroesophageal reflux; lung disease; outcomes	STAGE LUNG-DISEASE; GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX; TRANSPLANT; SURVIVAL	Background and AimGastroesophageal reflux has been associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), although the directionality of the relationship has been debated. Data on the value of objective reflux measures in predicting IPF disease progression and mortality remain limited. We aimed to evaluate the association between multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH testing (MII-pH) and 3-year pulmonary outcomes in IPF patients. MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study of adults with IPF who underwent pre-lung transplant MII-pH off acid suppression at a tertiary center. Patients were followed for 3 years after MII-pH for poor pulmonary outcomes (hospitalization for respiratory exacerbation or death). A secondary analysis was performed using mortality as outcome of interest. Time-to-event analyses using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were performed to evaluate associations between MII-pH and poor outcomes. ResultsOne hundred twenty-four subjects (mean age = 61.7 & PLUSMN; 8 years, 62% male) were included. Increased bolus exposure time (BET) on MII-pH was associated with decreased time to poor pulmonary outcomes and death (log-ranked P-value = 0.017 and 0.031, respectively). On multivariable Cox regression analyses controlling for potential confounders including age, sex, smoking history, body mass index, proton pump inhibitor use, baseline pulmonary function, and anti-fibrotic therapy, increased BET was an independent predictor for poor pulmonary outcomes [hazard ratio 3.18 (95% confidence interval: 1.25-8.09), P = 0.015] and mortality [hazard ratio 11.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.37-63.9), P = 0.025] over 3 years. ConclusionsIncreased BET on MII-pH is an independent predictor of poor pulmonary outcomes and mortality over 3 years in IPF patients. These findings also support a role for gastroesophageal reflux in IPF disease progression and the potential impact of routine reflux testing and treatment.

Unexpected capacity-building experiences of multicultural, multilingual participants in a public health initiative	PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING			English	Article; Early Access						capacity building; community-based organizations; public health		AimsThis study of a levy-voter funded public health initiative program (1) identifies capacity-building concerns, (2) summarizes those concerns at the community-based organization (CBO) level, and (3) documents the desired CBO capacity-building outcome. ParticipantsNineteen participants from nine CBOs were included, representing 95% of participants (19/20) and 90% of CBOs (9/10) from the initiative's program population. MethodsInterviews were conducted. A focus group validated data. Demographic surveys were completed. Methodology and AnalysisData were analyzed using demographic and inductive content analyses. Fifteen capacity-building unexpected concerns were identified. Participants from eight out of nine (88.8%) CBOs shared at least ten concerns. Seven CBO capacity-building outcomes were identified. ResultsCapacity-building providers helped participants mitigate the Initiative's capacity-building testing of the National Implementation Research Network (NIRN) model. Participants' NIRN processes were Western and mainstream. Participants wanted community-designed processes and the funder to understand CBO clients' backgrounds, cultures, and languages. The contract money did not match the needed capacity-building processes, time, and workload. DiscussionThe funder's pre-selected the NIRN Western majority approach did not fit. Participants wanted to lead. Capacity-building only for home-based program development was less desired. Social justice leadership could have made a difference.

Neuroimaging data showed promise to predict treatment outcome, but previous prediction attempts have been exploratory and reported small clinical sample sizes. Herein, we aimed to examine the incremental predictive value of neuroimaging data in contrast to clinical and demographic data alone (for which results were previously published), using a two-level multimodal ensemble machine-learning strategy. We used pretreatment structural and task-based fMRI data to predict virtual reality exposure therapy outcome in a bicentric sample of N=190 patients with spider phobia. First, eight 1st-level random forest classifications were conducted using separate data modalities (clinical questionnaire scores and sociodemographic data, cortical thickness and gray matter volumes, functional activation, connectivity, connectivity-derived graph metrics, and BOLD signal variance). Then, the resulting predictions were used to train a 2nd-level classifier that produced a final prediction. No 1st-level or 2nd-level classifier performed above chance level except BOLD signal variance, which showed potential as a contributor to higher-level prediction from multiple regions across the brain (1st-level balanced accuracy=0.63). Overall, neuroimaging data did not provide any incremental accuracy for treatment outcome prediction in patients with spider phobia with respect to clinical and sociodemographic data alone. Thus, we advise caution in the interpretation of prediction performances from small-scale, single-site patient samples. Larger multimodal datasets are needed to further investigate individual-level neuroimaging predictors of therapy response in anxiety disorders.

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is commonly used for "fingerprinting" and origin tracing in oil spills; however, this method is both time-consuming and lacks the resolving power to separate co-eluting compounds. Recent advances in methodologies to analyze petroleum substances using high-resolution analytical techniques have demonstrated both improved resolving power and higher throughput. One such method, ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS), is especially promising because it is both rapid and high-throughput, with the ability to discern among highly homologous hydrocarbon molecules. Previous applications of IMS-MS to crude oil analyses included a limited number of samples and did not provide detailed characterization of chemical constituents. We analyzed a diverse library of 195 crude oil samples using IMS-MS and applied a computational workflow to assign molecular formulas to individual features. The oils were from 12 groups based on geographical and geological origins: non-US (1 group), US onshore (3), and US Gulf of Mexico offshore (8). We hypothesized that information acquired through IMS-MS data would provide a more confident grouping and yield additional fingerprint information. Chemical composition data from IMS-MS was used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering, as well as machine learning-based supervised analysis to predict geographic and source rock categories for each sample; the latter also yielded several novel prospective biomarkers for fingerprinting of crude oils. We found that IMS-MS data have complementary advantages for fingerprinting and characterization of diverse crude oils and that proposed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon biomarkers can be used for rapid exposure characterization.

This review gives an overview of common techniques for setting up HSEs. The HSE consists of an artificial dermis and epidermis. 3T3-J2 murine fibroblasts, purchased human fibroblasts or freshly isolated and cultured fibroblasts, together with other components, for example, collagen type I, are used to build the scaffold. Freshly isolated and cultured keratinocytes are seeded on top. It is possible to add other cell types, for example, melanocytes, to the HSE-depending on the research question. After several days and further steps, the 3D skin can be harvested. Additionally, we show possible markers and techniques for evaluation of artificial skin. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of HSEs to human skin organ culture, a model which employs human donor skin. We outline advantages and limitations of both models and discuss future perspectives in using HSEs.

The cracks initiated and developed in EBCs owing to various reasons during service greatly undermine their lifespans. To address this problem, in this work, silicon carbide (SiC) in the forms of particles and whiskers with various amounts have been introduced to ytterbium disilicate (Yb2Si2O7), the mainstream EBC topcoat materials, so as to gain some self-healing potential. The results reveal that, the SiC inclusions in Yb2Si2O7 in the presence of ytterbium monosilicate (Yb2SiO5) can trigger the following reactions. Specifically, SiC self-healing agents are oxidized to form viscous SiO2, which actively reacts with Yb2SiO5 upon encountering it, forming Yb2Si2O7. This has brought twofold beneficial effects including ① silicon supplementation of disilicate topcoat, whose silicon element tends to be "dragged out" by water vapor, leading to the deterioration of thermal mismatch; as well as ② crack self-healing resulting from the volume expansion induced by the above reactions. Then the two aspects of self-healing agents, namely the "promptness" and "sustainability," have been discussed in detail. The former is unveiled to be more pertinent to the repairing of large cracks, whilst the latter is more relevant to the self-healing of tiny cracks at initiation or early stage of propagation. The current work sheds some lights on the design and development of more durable and robust EBCs with self-healing capability.

The literature describes the negative impact that both conditions have on children with SCD separately; however, the effect of OSA on asthmatic children with OSA is less specific. We hypothesized that the presence of OSA in children with SCD and asthma is associated with specific hematologic markers, worse clinical outcomes, and greater healthcare utilization. MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated children with both SCD and asthma who underwent polysomnography (PSG). We assessed their demographic information, PSG data, hematologic indices, and healthcare utilization based on the concurrent presence of OSA. ResultsFifty-nine percent of the cohort had OSA with a lower oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) nadir (87% vs. 93%, p < 0.001) and a lower median daytime SpO(2) (96.5% vs. 98.5%, p < 0.05); those with OSA were more likely to have the hemoglobin SS genotype (86% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.03). Additionally, those with OSA had a higher mean corpuscular volume (87 vs. 77.2 fL, p = 0.03) and reticulocyte count (10.1% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.01). There was no difference in asthma severity or healthcare utilization between those with OSA and those without OSA. DiscussionOverall, children with SCD and asthma might be at increased risk for developing OSA, and screening for sleep-disordered breathing should be incorporated as part of their routine care.

Design Rule Hidden from The Eye in S/N-Bridged Ancillary Ligands for Copper(I) Complexes Applied to Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						copper (I) complexes; light-emitting electrochemical cells; multivariate analysis; thermally activated delayed fluorescence; thin-film lighting	CU(I) COMPLEXES; DELAYED FLUORESCENCE; SINGLET; STATE; AREA	Enhancing low-energy emitting Cu(I)-ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is of utmost importance towards Cu(I)-iTMC-based white-emitting LECs. Here, the ancillary ligand design includes (i) extension of & pi;-systems and (ii) insertion of S-bridge between heteroaromatics rings. This led to two novel heteroleptic Cu(I)-iTMCs: 2-(pyridin-2-yl-l2-azanyl)quinoline (CuN2) and 2-(naphthalen-2-ylthio)quinoline (CuS2) as N<^>N and bis[(2-diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether as P<^>P, exhibiting improved photoluminescence quantum yields (& phi;) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence processes compared to their reference Cu(I)-iTMCs: di(pyridin-2-yl)-l2-azane (CuN1) and di(pyridin-2-yl)sulfane (CuS1). Despite CuS2 stands out with the highest & phi; (38% vs 17 / 14 / 1% for CuN1 / CuN2 / CuS1), only CuN2-LECs show the expected enhanced performance (0.35 cd A(-1) at luminance of 117 cd m(-2)) compared to CuN1-LECs (0.02 cd A(-1) at6 cd m(-2)), while CuS2-LECs feature low performances (0.04 cd A(-1) at 10 cd m(-2)). This suggests that conventional chemical design rules are not effective towards enhancing device performance. Herein, nonconventional multivariate statistical analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies allow to rationalize the mismatch between chemical design and device performance bringing to light a hidden design rule: polarizability of the ancillary ligand is key for an efficient Cu(I)-iTMC-LECs. All-in-all, this study provides fresh insights for the design of Cu-iTMCs fueling research on sustainable ion-based lighting sources.	[Giobbio, Ginevra; Cavinato, Luca M.

However, in this article, implementing heat pumps in existing buildings, a significant challenge is still presented due to high temperature requirements. In this article, a systematic analysis of the effects of heat source temperatures, maximum heat pump condenser temperatures, and system temperatures on the seasonal performance of heat pump (HP) systems is presented. The quantitative performance analysis encompasses over 50 heat pumps installed in residential buildings, revealing correlations between the building characteristics, observed temperatures, and heat pump type. The performance of an HP system retrofitted to a 30-dwelling multifamily building is presented in more detail. The bivalent HP system combines air and ground as heat sources and achieves a seasonal performance factor of 3.25 with a share of the gas boiler of 27% in its first year of operation. In these findings, the technical feasibility of retrofitting heat pumps is demonstrated in existing buildings and insights are provided into overcoming the challenges associated with high temperature requirements.

Moisture field of rice grains described using thin-layer equations. On this basis, the deep-bed drying of rice grains modeled with COMSOL, and verified its plausibility. The results showed that the drying rate of rice grains was significantly accelerated when the hot air temperature was increased from 40 & DEG;C to 70 & DEG;C, but the inhomogeneity of rice grains temperature increased by 29.79%, 22.31%, and 17.41% for every 10 & DEG;C increase. Drying grains faster with vertically arranged an angular air duct, with a 4.88% increase in drying speed in 300 min. The temperature difference between the top and the bottom of an angular air duct with a small width is smaller, about 11 & DEG;C, and the heating efficiency is better at the top, by 31.28%.Practical ApplicationsGrain dryers are often used in high-volume grain drying operations and it has been a great challenge to save the energy consumption of the drying process. It is necessary to use numerical simulation to design a reasonable structure of the heating section to improve the energy utilization efficiency of the heating section of the grain dryer. The numerical model proposed in this article can effectively simulate the spatial distribution of moisture content of rice under different structures of grain drying units, which can be used not only for the prediction of drying time but also for analyzing the optimal heating structure from it. A technical basis is provided for the design of grain dryers.

To realize efficient and rapid solar-driven water evaporation, developing and designing efficient photothermal conversion materials is of great significance. Herein, a high-entropy alloy (HEA) fiber membrane with rapid heating and wide spectral response is synthesized via adjusting high-entropy metals diffusion on the surface of carbon nanofibers by an electrospinning technology. Benefiting from the low equivalent evaporation enthalpy and high solar spectrum capacity of HEA fibers, the HEA (FeCoNiCuMn)-carbon nanofiber-5S2 achieves a rapid steam-generation rate of 2.74 kg m(-2) h(-1) with a solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of 99.4% under 1 sun illumination. In addition, the evaporator presented a stable seawater desalination and wastewater purification performance. Therefore, the HEA-based solar evaporator can be an alternative photothermal material for efficient solar steam generation.

We compared how children with dry night cough differ from those who wheeze. MethodsLuftiBus in the school is a population-based study of schoolchildren conducted between 2013 and 2016 in Zurich, Switzerland. We divided children into four mutually exclusive groups based on reported dry night cough (henceforth referred as "cough") and wheeze and compared parent-reported symptoms, comorbidities, exposures, FeNO, spirometry, and healthcare use and treatment. ResultsAmong 3457 schoolchildren aged 6-17 years, 294 (9%) reported "cough," 181 (5%) reported "wheeze," 100 (3%) reported "wheeze and cough," and 2882 (83%) were "asymptomatic." Adjusting for confounders in a multinomial regression, children with "cough" reported more frequent colds, rhinitis, and snoring than "asymptomatic" children; children with "wheeze" or "wheeze and cough" more often reported hay fever, eczema, and parental histories of asthma. FeNO and spirometry were similar among "asymptomatic" and children with "cough," while children with "wheeze" or "wheeze and cough" had higher FeNO and evidence of bronchial obstruction. Children with "cough" used healthcare less often than those with "wheeze," and they attended mainly primary care. Twenty-two children (7% of those with "cough") reported a physician diagnosis of asthma and used inhalers. These had similar characteristics as children with wheeze. ConclusionOur representative population-based study confirms that children with dry night cough without wheeze clearly differed from those with wheeze. This suggests asthma is unlikely, and they should be investigated for alternative aetiologies, particularly upper airway disease.

Although it is expected that spin wave interference can perform as highly efficient reservoir computing in some micromagnetic simulations, there has been no experimental verification to date. Herein, reservoir computing is demonstrated that utilizes multidetected nonlinear spin wave interference in an yttrium-iron-garnet single crystal. The subject computing system achieves excellent performance when used for hand-written digit recognition, second-order nonlinear dynamical tasks, and nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA). It is of particular note that normalized mean square errors for NARMA2 and second-order nonlinear dynamical tasks are 1.81 x 10(-2) and 8.37 x 10(-5), respectively, which are the lowest figures for any experimental physical reservoir so far reported. Said high performance is achieved with higher nonlinearity and the large memory capacity of interfered spin wave multidetection.

As rare sugars, L-hexoses are not readily obtained from natural sources. Access to L-hexose building blocks from commercially available and inexpensive D-sugars is highly desirable from the viewpoints of organic synthesis and drug discovery. As demonstrated by the convenient preparation of L-glucosyl, L-galactosyl, and L-mannosyl fluorides from readily available ss-D-C-glucosyl, ss-D-C-mannosyl, and ss- D-C-galactosyl derivatives, we describe a novel and efficient approach to the demanding L-glycosyl fluorides. The transformation features the installation of anomeric hydroxymethyl group under mild conditions and C1-to-C5 switch of sugar rings through radical decarboxylative fluorination of uronic acids. The power of this protocol is highlighted by the first assembly of a pentasaccharide repeating unit of Pseudomonas ATCC 31554 extracellular polysaccharide (S-88). This synthesis relies on the efficient extension of sugar chain at the sterically hindered hydroxy group and the facile introduction of L-mannosyl unit using L-mannosyl fluoride as glycosylating agent. The methods developed in this work would provide new tools to the arsenal of synthesis of L-sugar building blocks and of assembly of glycans containing L-sugar moieties.

J	Rabaiotti, D; Coulson, T; Woodroffe, R				Rabaiotti, Daniella; Coulson, Tim; Woodroffe, Rosie			Climate change is predicted to cause population collapse in a cooperative breeder	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; demography; individual-based model; Lycaon pictus; mammal; populations; social species; temperature	AFRICAN WILD DOGS; GROUP-SIZE; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; LYCAON-PICTUS; SURVIVAL; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; EVOLUTION; MAMMALS; DEMOGRAPHY	It has been suggested that animals may have evolved cooperative breeding strategies in response to extreme climatic conditions. Climate change, however, may push species beyond their ability to cope with extreme climates, and reduce the group sizes in cooperatively breeding species to a point where populations are no longer viable. Predicting the impact of future climates on these species is challenging as modelling the impact of climate change on their population dynamics requires information on both group- and individual-level responses to climatic conditions. Using a single-sex individual-based model incorporating demographic responses to ambient temperature in an endangered species, the African wild dog Lycaon pictus, we show that there is a threshold temperature above which populations of the species are predicted to collapse. For simulated populations with carrying capacities equivalent to the median size of real-world populations (nine packs), extinction risk increases once temperatures exceed those predicted in the best-case climate warming scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 2.6). The threshold is higher (between RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0) for larger simulated populations (30 packs), but 84% of real-world populations number <30 packs. Simulated populations collapsed because, at high ambient temperatures, juvenile survival was so low that packs were no longer recruiting enough individuals to persist, leading them to die out. This work highlights the importance of social dynamics in determining impacts of climatic variables on social species, and the critical role that recruitment can play in driving population-level impacts of climate change. Population models parameterised on long-term data are essential for predicting future population viability under climate change.

Focusing on the relationship between sectors' positions in the global supply chain, this study develops a structural position analysis framework based on input-output analysis. Our framework reveals the highest-priority sectors and transactions, and the best strategies for CO2 emission reduction in the global supply chain. The strategies identified focus on cross-border transactions and highlight the need for inter-sectoral and international collaboration. The results indicate that the United States and China have different priorities and characteristics (even vis-a-vis the same industry), and that joint emission reduction policies should be coordinated to take advantage of each country's emission reduction potential. Our findings suggest that, in the United States and Europe, policies to promote the reduction of direct emissions from production of goods for exports through carbon taxes are important. Contrarily, in Asian countries, carbon emissions originate mainly from intermediate goods trades, suggesting the need for mandatory life cycle assessment reporting and emissions disclosure. Our analytical framework thus proposes specific policies that could effectively reduce specific sectors' and transactions' carbon footprints.

A simple stirring allowed the grafting of N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin inhitopes onto their surface by copper-free strain promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition click reaction. The synthesized iminosugars clusters were tested as multivalent inhibitors of the biologically relevant enzymes & beta;-glucocerebrosidase and acid & alpha;-glucosidase, involved in Gaucher and Pompe lysosomal storage diseases, respectively. For both enzymes, all the multivalent compounds were more potent than the reference N-hexyl deoxynojirimycin. Remarkably, the final dodecavalent compound proved to be one of the best & beta;-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors described to date. These cyclotriphosphazene-based deoxynojirimycin dendrimers were then evaluated as pharmacological chaperones against Gaucher disease. Not only did these multivalent constructs cross the cell membranes but they were also able to increase & beta;-glucocerebrosidase activity in Gaucher cells. Notably, dodecavalent compound allowed a 1.4-fold enzyme activity enhancement at a concentration as low as 100 nM. These new monofluorocyclooctyne-presenting dendrimers may further find numerous applications in the synthesis of multivalent objects for biological and pharmacological purposes.

Previous measurement systems provided accurate measurements; however, their most significant disadvantage was the relatively low spatial resolution, including in the vertical profile. The aim of this work was to develop and initially validate a new, original temperature measurement system based on the photonic sensing technique of optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR). The system consists of a fibre-optic sensor, an interrogator, and an automatic data acquisition system. Such fibre-optic sensors allow a significant increase in spatial resolution. Data on precise temperature distribution in the ground profile will allow for a detailed determination of the changes in the thickness of the permafrost active layer (PAL) and, as a consequence, a better description of the current state of the permafrost and the layers above it in relation to their progressive degradation. In the longer term, it will make a better prediction of the pace of possible changes in the polar environment and will open up previously unavailable opportunities in the field of climate change monitoring and forecasting.

In EFL learning and teaching settings, student motivation, cultural adequation, and historical imagination are also needed. In Tunisia, this was further complicated after the Jasmine Revolution when newly radicalised students of English resented aspects of premodern literature which they considered inaccurate, uninteresting, or inappropriate. In this paper, the author presents a learning and teaching model developed to help post-revolutionary Tunisian learners with diverse backgrounds and orientations better understand and appreciate the works of Geoffrey Chaucer. Combining elements of cognitive studies, comparative literature, and digital codicology, this bricolage was used in graduate seminars at the University of Sousse to study digitised manuscripts and texts in Arabic, Latin, and (Middle) English. Informed by active pedagogy and enhanced by audio-visual aids, activities based on this model effectively addressed challenges, helped achieve learning outcomes, and made Tunisians more at home with Chaucer.

PurposeThe purpose of this comparative study was to evaluate the 3- and 5-year survival and failure rate of tooth-supported resin-bonded fixed dental prosthesis compared to implant-supported single crowns. The null hypothesis was that there was no significant difference in survival rate, occurrence of complications or patient-reported outcome between RBFDPs and ISSCs. Materials and MethodsA total of 45 resin-bonded FDPs were inserted in 27 young patients (test group) with tooth agenesis in the anterior part of the maxilla or mandible and a control group of 28 patients also with tooth agenesis in the anterior region but treated with 40 implant-supported single crowns were included in this study. All patients and treatments were followed with a baseline and a 3- or 5-year examination. All patients had to fill out an Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-49) questionnaire at baseline and at the 3- or 5-year examination. The restorations were evaluated according to the Copenhagen Index Score (CIS). ResultsFor the RBFDP (test) group there was an 82% survival rate and 18% failure rate, that is, four RBFDPs were not in situ after 3 years and four RBFDPs were not in situ after 5 years. Correspondingly, the ISSC showed a survival rate of 98% and a failure rate of 2%, that is, only one failure (ceramic fracture) after 3 and none after 5 years. Of the 82% RBFDPs in situ, there were no complications in 78% of the cases, whereas 22% had complications after 3 (4 complications) and 5 years (4 complications). There were 92% of the ISSCs without any complications and 8% (ie, 3 ISSCs) with complications after 3 or 5 years. In general, there was a significant reduction in the OHIP-49 scores, for example, an improved oral health quality of life for both treatment options. ConclusionThe results of this study indicate that ISSCs have lower complication and failure rates than RBFDPs. In general, the OHIP-scores were significantly reduced regardless of whether RBFDPs or ISSC were used.

Material and methodsAll liveborn children from 2002 to 2015 were included. Information was collected from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, linked to the Norwegian Quality and Surveillance Registry for Cerebral Palsy as of December 31, 2022. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the prevalence of cerebral palsy per 1000 live births after ART and natural conception with birth year as covariate, crude odds ratios (OR) for cerebral palsy among children born after ART using children born after natural conception as reference, and OR adjusted for potential confounders, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Potential mediators of the association were studied in stratified analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to compare proportions in clinical characteristics among children with cerebral palsy born after ART and natural conception. ResultsAmong 833 645 livebirths, 23 645 children were born after ART and of the latter 97 were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The overall prevalence of cerebral palsy after ART was 4.10 per 1000 live births (95% CI 3.36-5.00), decreasing from 7.79 per 1000 in 2002 to 3.55 in 2015. Compared with children born after natural conception, the OR for cerebral palsy was 2.01 (95% CI 1.63-2.47) adjusted for mother's age at birth, parity, and pre-pregnancy health. When restricted to singletons born at term, the adjusted OR for cerebral palsy was 1.13 (95% CI 0.76-1.69). The distribution of cerebral palsy subtypes and the severity of gross and fine motor function and associated impairments did not differ significantly between children with cerebral palsy born after ART and natural conception. ConclusionsChildren born after ART had a risk of cerebral palsy that was twice that of children born after natural conception. The increased risk of cerebral palsy after ART is likely attributed to multiple pregnancies and preterm births. The prevalence of cerebral palsy after ART decreased significantly during the study period, despite an increased use of ART in the population. The distribution of clinical characteristics did not differ between children with cerebral palsy born after ART and those born after a natural conception, suggesting that the risk factors for, and causes of cerebral palsy were similar.

Therefore, we aimed to reduce lauric acid content (& SIM;30%) in VCO and evaluate its effect compared to VCO and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), on food intake, bodyweight (BW), lipid profiles, and hepatic histology. Female C57BL/6 mice were treated with different diets for 3 months: control (normal diet), high-fat diet (HF), HF + VCO, HF + MCT, HF + low lauric acid VCO (LLA), and normal diet + LLA (C + LLA). LLA was prepared by enzymatic interesterification of VCO with methyl octanoate (methyl caprylate) and methyl decanoate (methyl caprate). Plasma and liver lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride, were measured by colorimetric assay, and hepatic fat accumulation was examined by oil-red-O staining. HF mice exhibited high plasma and liver TC and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). VCO or MCT treatment lowered liver TC and LDL, whereas LLA increased plasma HDL and markedly improved TC:HDL ratio. The HF-induced hepatic fat accumulation was attenuated by all treatments, of which VCO was the most effective. Control mice administered with LLA demonstrated lower liver TC and LDL, but higher plasma TC and HDL compared to controls. Lowest BW gain and food intake were found in mice treated with LLA. In conclusion, VCO, MCT, and LLA ameliorated hepatic histopathology caused by HF. VCO and MCT improved liver lipid profiles, whereas LLA has more beneficial effect on plasma lipids via a better TC:HDL ratio and showed promise for BW control.

Poly-p-phenylene benzodioxole (PBO) is a high performance fiber with excellent mechanical properties. In this work, for the first time, elasto- and twistocaloric cooling of PBO fibers by stretching and twisting of the PBO fiber bundles is reported. The cooling temperature reaches -0.4 and -1.3 K, for fiber stretching and twisting, respectively. A self-coiled PBO fiber achieves maximum cooling of -3.7 K upon stretching by 35% strain, with an exceptionally high cycle life of 200 000 times. During the twisting of the PBO fibers, reversible changes in the intensity of the diffraction peaks in X-ray diffraction patterns are observed. A strain-sensitive color change application is realized by coating a self-coiled PBO fiber with liquid crystallite dyes. This work provides new perspectives for PBO fibers as a high cycle-life solid-state refrigeration material.

However, the aggregation issue, insufficient dielectric loss capacity, and lack of magnetic loss capacity for MXene severely hinder its practical applications. Herein, the authors propose multi-dimensional nanostructure engineering to electrostatically assemble 2D MXene and layered double hydroxides (LDH) derived from ZIF-67 polyhedron into a 3D hollow framework (LDH@MXene), and subsequently calcined to construct a Co nanoparticle-modified 3D hollow C-LDH@MXene framework to encapsulate a paraffin wax (PW) phase change material (PCM). The 3D hollow C-LDH@MXene framework not only prevents 2D MXene from aggregation but also contributes a high thermal energy storage density (131.04 J g(-1)). Benefiting from a 3D conductive network facilitating the rapid transport of photons and phonons from the interface to the interior and the synergistic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of MXene and Co magnetic nanoparticles, the C-LDH@MXene-PW composite PCM yielded a high photothermal storage efficiency of 96.52%. Besides, C-LDH@MXene-PW composite PCMs also exhibited efficient microwave absorption with a minimum reflection loss of -20.87 dB at 13.30 GHz with a matching thickness of only 2 mm. This distinctive design provides constructive references for the development of integrated composite materials for energy storage and microwave absorption.

The treatment of Sc(CH2SiMe3)(3)(THF)(2) with equimolar amounts of [(LH3)-H-1,2]Cl afforded chloro complexes (LScCl)-Sc-1,2(solv)(2) (solv=THF, Py) in 76-85 % yields. (LScCl)-Sc-1,2(THF)(2) were also prepared by the salt metathesis reactions of ScCl3 with [L-1,L-2]Na-2 generated from [(LH3)-H-1,2]Cl and 3 equiv. of NaN(SiMe3)(2) (-40 & DEG;C, THF) and isolated in somewhat lower yields (68-73 %). (LScCl)-Sc-2(THF)(2) was subjected to the alkylation reaction with LiCH2SiMe3 affording alkyl derivative [(LSc)-Sc-2(CH2SiMe3)](2).

Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1 is increased in mast cells in psoriasis and actinic keratosis, but not markedly in keratinocyte skin carcinomas	EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						CRH-R1; mast cell; skin cancer	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; VITAMIN-D; CRH; EXPRESSION; STRESS; PROOPIOMELANOCORTIN; INFLAMMATION; LIGAND	Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor-1 (CRH-R1) is expressed in human mast cells, but its role in skin diseases is unknown. By using a sequential double-staining technique, the mast cell expression of CRH-R1 was investigated in biopsies from lesional and non-lesional skin samples of patients with actinic keratosis (AK), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and psoriasis. Dermal tryptase(+) mast cells expressed CRH-R1 immunoreactivity in the non-lesional skin in all patient groups. The CRH-R1 expression was significantly increased in the lesional skin of AK (p = 0.03) and psoriasis (p = 0.02), non-significantly in BCC (p = 0.129), but not increased in SCC. To investigate the regulation of CRH-R1, the LAD2 mast cell line was irradiated with UVB or stimulated with CRH or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 [1,25-(OH)(2)D-3]. Consequently, UVB at 90 mJ/cm(2) (p = 0.041) and 120 mJ/cm(2) (p = 0.039) decreased CRH-R1 expression. Instead, CRH at 100 and 1000 nM increased CRH-R1 immunostaining, but did not affect the proliferative response. The treatment with 10 and 100 nM 1,25-(OH)(2)D-3 led to a noticeable increase in CRH-R1 staining. After irradiating with UVB, the concentration of CRH increased in the conditioned medium, but not in sonicated LAD2 mast cells. In conclusion, the lack of sufficient levels of CRH-R1 in mast cells may be related to diminished antitumoural response in SCC and possibly in BCC.

J	Harinck, F; Dooren, L				Harinck, Fieke; Dooren, Loes			Improvisation Exercises Increase Negotiators' Divergent Thinking, and Sometimes their Negotiation Outcomes	JOURNAL OF CREATIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Early Access						negotiation; improvisation; divergent thinking		Two studies investigated the effect of a short improvisation intervention (theatrical improvisation in Study 1, musical improvisation in Study 2) on negotiation processes and outcomes. The expectation was that an improvisation exercise, compared to a control condition in which participants engaged in jigsaw puzzling, would result in better negotiation agreements via higher levels of divergent thinking. Results showed that improvisation exercise increased participants' divergent thinking, compared to the control condition. The effects on negotiation processes and outcomes, however, only partly supported the predictions. In Study 2, improvisation exercise had an indirect influence on negotiation outcomes via divergent thinking, and in Study 1 improvisation exercise did influence divergent thinking but did not influence negotiation outcomes. So improvisation exercise increases divergent thinking, and sometimes this heightened divergent thinking results in higher negotiation outcomes.

Physical therapy provision for patients with pneumonia in US hospitals	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL MEDICINE			English	Article							EARLY MOBILITY; OLDER-ADULTS; CARE; OUTCOMES; SURVIVORS	BackgroundPhysical therapy (PT) appears beneficial for hospitalized patients. Little is known about PT practice patterns and costs across hospitals. ObjectiveTo examine whether receiving PT is associated with specific patient and hospital characteristics for patients with pneumonia. We also explored the variability in PT service provision and costs between hospitals. MethodsWe included administrative claims from 2010 to 2015 in the Premier Healthcare Database, inclusive of 644 US hospitals. We examined associations between receiving at least one PT visit and patient (age, race, insurance, intensive care utilization, comorbidity status, and length of stay) and hospital (academic status, rurality, size, and location) characteristics. Exploratory measures included timing and proportion of days with PT visits, and per-visit and per-admission costs. ResultsOf 768,010 patients, 49% had PT. After adjustment, older age most significantly increased the probability of receiving PT (+38.0% if >80 vs. & LE;50 years). Higher comorbidity burden, longer length of stay, and hospitalization in an urban setting were also associated with higher probability. Hospitalization in the South most significantly decreased the probability (-9.1% vs. Midwest). Patients without Medicare and Non-White patients also had lower probability. Median (interquartile range) days to first visit was 2 (1-4). Mean proportion of days with a visit was 35% & PLUSMN; 20%. Median per-visit cost was $88.90 [$56.70-$130.90] and per-admission was $224.00 [$137.80-$369.20]. ConclusionBoth clinical (intensive care utilization and comorbidity status) and non-clinical (age, race, rurality, location) factors were associated with receiving PT. Within and between hospitals, there was high variability in the number and frequency of visits, and costs.

Cultural representation in German as a foreign language textbooks used in Indonesia: A critical social semiotic analysis	FOREIGN LANGUAGE ANNALS			English	Article						critical social semiotic approach; cultural representation; foreign language textbooks; systemic functional linguistics	EDUCATION; ENGLISH	Informed by an integrated critical social semiotic approach, the present critical discourse study investigates the semiotic relations of image-text and the cultural meanings encapsulated in two German language textbooks: Studio d A1 and Netzwerk A1 widely used in Indonesia. Adopting Xiong and Peng's semiotic relation model, the findings demonstrate that Netzwerk A1 provides learners with opportunities to learn, think, and reflect critically on German culture through pedagogical questions regarding image-text-pedagogy discussion. However, the image-text in Studio d A1 emphasizes the acquisition of linguistic knowledge and does not engage learners in exploring and negotiating their cultural repertoire. This empirical evidence suggests that language textbook writers should consider designing culturally responsive language learning tasks to engage learners in the active construction of cultural knowledge in practice.

This compound crystallizes with the ZrBeSi structure type with the space group P6(3)/mmc (no. 194), a=4.9917(6) & ANGS;, c=9.079(2) & ANGS;, V=195.92(7) & ANGS;(3) with two formula units per unit cell. In addition to being a colored ternary variant of the AlB2 type, the crystal structure of BaLiBi can be also viewed as a "stuffed" variant of the NiAs structure, where the Bi atoms form a hexagonal close packing, the Ba atoms occupy the octahedral voids in this packing, and the Li atoms are located between adjacent tetrahedral voids on their common triangular faces. In the absence of direct Bi-Bi interactions, the BaLiBi crystal structure rationalized according to the notation (Ba2+)(Li+)(Bi3-), suggesting an electron-balanced composition, i. e., a Zintl phase. In line with this notation, scalar-relativistic first-principle calculations with the LMTO code reveal a semiconducting ground state, with a bandgap of about 0.6 eV. Fully relativistic electronic structure calculations predict a semimetallic ground state.

Higher MFFT latexes do not produce continuous coherent films at low temperatures during application. Consequently, in order to solve the paradoxical problem of obtaining latex films with high T-g at low emulsion MFFT, a series of alkali soluble resin (ASR) stabilized latexes were synthesized in this study using a semi-continuous pre-emulsification polymerization process. The microstructure of latex particles, polymerization stability, composition and properties of latex films were characterized and tested by ATR-FTIR, TEM, ZETA potential analyzer, DSC, orthomorphic metallographic microscope, and gloss tester. The results show that the addition of ASR reduces the content of coagulum during polymerization and significantly increases the number of latex particles. The high T-g ASR also induces the formation of a microphase separation structure with a dual glass transition in the latex film, which improves heat resistance. Additionally, hydroplasticized ASR reduces emulsion MFFT, improves latex film flatness, and enhances its glossiness. The introduction of ASR acts as a dual role of synergy with conventional ionic surfactants during synthesis to increase the stability of composite latexes and with polyacrylate (PA) in application to enhance its properties.

The World Health Organization recognizes RA as one of the most prevalent chronic inflammatory diseases. In the last decade, there was an expansion on the available RA therapeutic options which aimed to improve patient's quality of life. Despite the extensive research and the emergence of new therapeutic approaches and drugs, there are still significant unwanted side effects associated to these drugs and still a vast number of patients that do not respond positively to the existing therapeutic strategies. Over the years, several references to the use of flavonoids in the quest for new treatments for RA have emerged. This review aimed to summarize the existing literature about the flavonoids' effects on the major pathogenic/molecular targets of RA and their potential use as lead compounds for the development of new effective molecules for RA treatment. It is demonstrated that flavonoids can modulate various players in synovial inflammation, regulate immune cell function, decrease synoviocytes proliferation and balance the apoptotic process, decrease angiogenesis, and stop/prevent bone and cartilage degradation, which are all dominant features of RA. Although further investigation is necessary to determine the effectiveness of flavonoids in humans, the available data from in vitro and in vivo models suggest their potential as new disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. This review highlights the use of flavonoids as a promising avenue for future research in the treatment of RA.	[Rufino, Ana T.; Freitas, Marisa; Proenca, Carina; de Oliveira, Jose M. P.

In this report, a metal-free intramolecular benzylic sp(3) C-H amination is disclosed using aryl nitro compounds as aryl nitrene precursors. Organosilicon reagent N,N'-bis(trimethylsilyl)-4,4'-bipyridinylidene (Si-DHBP) served as an efficient reductant in the transformation, enabling the in situ generation of aryl nitrene species for the direct, metal-free synthesis of unprotected 2-arylindolines from the corresponding nitroarene compounds.

Herein, this work develops a distinctive ternary method that adding an amorphous B & LARR;N embedded polymer named BN-Cl-2fT to a crystallized host polymer blend of PM6 (a commercialized polymer donor) and PY-TT (a copolymer of Y6 and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene). Although the structures between BN-Cl-2fT and PM6 and PY-TT are completely different, excellent miscibility is found between BN-Cl-2fT and both of the host PM6 and PY-TT, which can be interpreted by the crowded phenyl groups anchoring along the backbone of BN-Cl-2fT, leading to weak self-aggregation. Glazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS) measurements explicitly confirm the crystallization of PM6 and PY-TT and amorphous feature of BN-Cl-2fT. Furthermore, adding 10 wt% BN-Cl-2fT to PM6:PY-TT can significantly enhance the crystallization of the host polymers. Thus the ternary devices based on PM6:PY-TT:BN-Cl-2fT afford promote short-circuit current density (J(SC), 23.29 vs. 21.80 mA cm(-2)), fill factor (FF, 62.4% vs. 60.0%), and power conversion efficiency (PCE, 13.70% vs. 12.23%) in contrast to these parameters of binary devices based on PM6:PY-TT. This work provides a unique and enlightening avenue to design high performance all-PSCs by adding amorphous B & LARR;N embedded polymers as guest component to enhance host-crystallization.

Stem cells possess a remarkable antioxidant capacity and the ability to proliferate, differentiate, and migrate, and their main mode of action is through paracrine secretion, with exosomes being the primary form of secretion. Stem cell-derived exosomes contain a variety of growth factors and cytokines and may have great potential to promote skin repair and delay skin ageing. MethodsThis review focuses on the mechanisms of UV-induced skin photoaging, the research progress of stem cell exosomes against skin photoaging, emerging application approaches and limitations in the application of exosome therapy. ResultExosomes derived from various stem cells have the potential to prevent skin photoaging. ConclusionThe combination with novel materials may be a key step for their practical application, which could be an important direction for future basic research and practical applications.

Thermoelectric cementitious composites that use temperature difference power generation to achieve the transformation of thermal and electrical energy can achieve a reduction in urban environmental temperature and alleviate resource depletion. However, the low thermoelectric conversion efficiency at this stage restricts its development. Herein, boron-doped carbon nanotubes (B-CNTs) are proposed to improve the thermoelectric properties of cement materials by doping boron into carbon nanotubes through the thermal diffusion method. At H3BO3: CNTs = 1:4, the synthesized B-CNTs improve the Seebeck coefficient, which is mainly due to the increase in defect content and the appearance of additional phases around the Fermi energy level, leading to enhanced thermoelectric properties due to the increase in carrier scattering intensity. The thermoelectric optimum of the cement matrix composite with 7.0 wt% B-CNTs content is 1.1 x 10(-4), which is three times higher than that of the undoped carbon nanotube. This article provides a research idea to modify the thermoelectric properties of the material by doping the carbon material.

Adiabatic null passage for on-resonance magnetization transfer preparation	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						adiabatic null passage; direct saturation; magnetization transfer; T-2 effect	TRANSFER CONTRAST MTC; CROSS-RELAXATION; IN-VIVO; SATURATION-TRANSFER; BINOMIAL PULSES; EXCHANGE; PROTON; TISSUE; INVERSION; WATER	Purpose: We propose a novel RF pulse providing an adiabatic null passage (ANP) for magnetization transfer preparation with improved insensitivity to B-1(+) and B-0 inhomogeneities and mitigated direct saturation and T-2 effects. Method: The phase modulation function of a 6-ms time-resampled frequency offset-corrected pulse was modified to achieve zero flip angle at the end of the pulse. The spectral response was simulated, and its insensitivity to B-0 and B-1(+) was investigated and compared with a phase-inverted (121- 121) binomial pulse. The proposed pulse was implemented in a 2D-EPI pulse sequence to generate magnetization transfer (MT) contrast and MT ratio (MTR) maps. In vivo experiments were performed on 3 healthy participants with power-matched settings for ANP and the binomial pulse with the following parameters: 6-ms binomial pulse with a flip angle of 107 degrees (shortest element) and pulse repetition period (PRP) of TRslice = 59 ms, three experiments with 6-ms ANP and constant MT used overdrive factor (OF)/PRP values of 1/TRslice,root 2/2TR(slice), andv3/3TR(slice). Results: At gray matter (white matter) in vivo, the MTR decreased from 61% (64%) at OF= 1 to 38% (42%) applying ANP with an OF = root 3 and PRP= 3TR(slice), demonstrating the mitigation of T2/direct effect by 22% (22%). Bloch-McConnell simulations gave similar values. In vivo experiments showed significant improvement in the MTR values for areas with high B-0 inhomogeneity. Conclusion: ANP pulse was shown to be advantageous over its binomial counterpart in providingMT contrast by mitigating the T-2 effect and direct saturation of the liquid pool as well as reduced sensitivity to B-1(+) and B-0 inhomogeneity.

This research follows the foundations of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and examines how cognitive and peripheral cues impact experiential dimensions, leading to chatbot user recommendation intentions. The study introduced warmth and competence as mediating variables in both the purchase and postpurchase stages, utilizing a robust explanatory sequential mixed-method research design. The researchers tested and validated the proposed conceptual model using a 3 x 3 factorial design, collecting 354 responses in the purchase stage and 286 responses in the postpurchase stage. In the second stage, they conducted in-depth qualitative interviews (Study 2) to gain further insights into the validity of the experimental research (Study 1). The results obtained from Study 1 revealed that "cognitive cues" and "competence" significantly influence recommendation intentions among chatbot users. On the other hand, "peripheral cues" and warmth significantly contribute to positive experiences encountered during the purchase stage. The researchers further identified 69 thematic codes through exploratory research, providing a deeper understanding of the variables. Theoretically, this study extends the ELM by introducing new dimensions to human-machine interactions at the heart of digital transformation. From a managerial standpoint, the study emphasizes the significance of adding a "humanness" element in chatbot development to create more engaging and positive customer experiences actively.

Study designProspective, cohort study. AnimalsDogs and cats undergoing soft tissue or orthopedic surgery over a 12-month period at a referral hospital. MethodsClients were emailed a questionnaire 30 days postoperatively, or 90 days where an implant was used. Three algorithms were developed to diagnose SSIs using one or both of two criteria: (1) presence of any wound healing problems; (2) wound dehiscence or antibiotic prescription, and either purulent discharge or two or more clinical signs (redness, pain, heat, swelling, discharge). Algorithmic diagnoses were compared to gold standard diagnoses made by veterinarians. ResultsOf 754 surgical procedures, 309 responses were completed with 173 corresponding gold standard diagnoses. The most accurate algorithm determined "SSI" or "No SSI" from 90.2% of responses with 95.5% (92.4-98.6) accuracy, 82.6% (77-88.3) sensitivity, 97.7% (95.5-100) specificity, 86.4% (81.2-91.5) positive predictive value, and 97% (94.5-99.6) negative predictive value. "No SSI" was diagnosed in responses not meeting criterion 1, and "SSI" in responses meeting criteria 1 and 2. "Inconclusive" responses, comprising 9.8% of responses, met criterion 1 but not 2. Overall SSI rate was 62/754 (8.2%) and 12/62 (19.4%) SSIs were detected by active surveillance only. ConclusionUse of this client questionnaire accurately diagnosed SSIs; active surveillance increased SSI detection. Clinical significanceSurveillance of SSIs should be active and can be simplified by using a client questionnaire and algorithmic diagnoses, allowing automated distribution, data collection and analysis.

Dapagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), has shown promising effects against diabetes in rodent experiments and human clinical assays. This study aimed to determine the underlying mechanism and examine the effect of dapagliflozin on diabetic cognitive impairment. To create an in vivo model of diabetic cognitive impairment, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice were used. Dapagliflozin was administered to mice for 8 weeks. The context fear condition and Morris water maze test was used to evaluate mice's behavioral change. Western blotting was used to evaluate protein expression. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Nissl staining were applied to monitor morphological and structural changes. Congo red staining was performed to identify the formation of senile plaques. Mitochondria morphology was examined using a transmission electron microscope, and blood flow in the mouse cerebral cortex was measured using a laser Doppler imaging assay. Comparison to the diabetes mellitus (DM) group, the dapagliflozin group had lower glucose levels. Behavioral studies have shown that dapagliflozin can restore memory deficits in diabetic mice. The murky cell membrane edges and Nissl bodies more difficult to identify in the DM group were revealed by HE and Nissl staining, which were both improved by dapagliflozin treatment. Dapagliflozin inhibited the progression of A ss generation and the reduced cerebral blood flow in the DM group was rescued.

We identify neoliberal postfeminism's structural contradictions and lingering individuating forces within a state-instituted yet bottom-up women empowerment collectivization program, enriching the emerging critique of neoliberal postfeminization, particularly within intersectionality conversations. Despite these impediments, the collective gradually developed a situational embodied relational collective feminist solidarity that facilitated possibilities for creating alternatives to neoliberal postfeminist patriarchal ways of organizing work and working bodies. By narratively mapping these processes, we hope to advance the emerging discussions on the development of feminist solidarity and solidaristic alternatives.

The survival condition is a crucial issue for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. The survival of ICT patients with CCRT treatment versus standard CCRT alone should be elucidated via a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. MethodsWe compared ICT with CCRT and CCRT alone treatment to determine if ICT with CCRT can be associated with a significant benefit of survival conditions versus CCRT. Different survival indicators were analyzed for the ICT with CCRT. Twelve studies with a total of 3711 patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were enrolled. The focused outcome was the overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and locoregional recurrence-free survival. ResultsOur results showed that ICT with CCRT is associated with a significant benefit for the overall survival status versus CCRT treatment. Similar significant benefits in the survival condition were seen in progression-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and locoregional recurrence-free survival. ConclusionsThe updated meta-analysis results suggest that the ICT with CCRT might be associated with significant benefits of survival in overall, progression-free, distant metastasis-free, as well as locoregional recurrence-free dimensions versus CCRT treatment. However, the bias of different kinds, doses, and regimens of chemotherapy agents and radiotherapy should not be ignored.

By using microRNA-9 regulated viral vectors for multicolor labeling and longitudinal in vivo monitoring of individual microglia, we followed their fate in the cortex of healthy adult mice and at the onset of amyloidosis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In wild-type mice, microglia were rather mobile (16% of the cells migrated at least once in 10-20 days) but had a low turnover as documented by low division and death rates. Half of the migratory events were tightly associated with blood vessels. Surprisingly, basic migration properties of microglia (i.e., fraction of migrating cells, saltatory migration pattern, speed of migration, translocation distance, and strong association with blood vessels) were preserved in amyloid-depositing brains, despite amyloid plaques becoming the major destination of migration. Besides, amyloid deposition significantly increased microglial division and death rates. Moreover, the plaque vicinity became a hotspot of microglial turnover, harboring 33% of all migration, 70% of death and 54% of division events.

QSPR analysis through graph models for predicting ADMET properties of antifungal drugs to treat fungal diseases	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						ADMET property; antifungal drugs; domination; domination number; QSPR analysis	TOTAL DOMINATION	The chemical structure of a drug is considered as a chemical graph G (sic) (V, E), where the vertex set V is the set of atoms and the edge set E is the set of bonds between the atoms. Fungi-related diseases are becoming a more serious medical problem as a result of changes in the worldwide environment. In this article, the QSPR analysis is performed to predict the ADMET properties of the drugs used to treat fungal infections such as mucormycosis, blastomycosis, invasive candidiasis, talaromycosis, cryptococcus, neoformans, and so forth. The antifungal drugs posaconazole, isavuconazole, and amphotericin B and its analogs are considered to carry out the QSPR analysis. The domination numbers of these drugs are determined to correlate with their ADMET properties through cubic regression and the analysis suggests a high association between the domination numbers of drugs and their ADMET properties. The ADMET properties of the analog structures of the drug amphotericin B are also predicted in this QSPR analysis.	[Parveen, S. Thilsath; Balamurugan, B.

In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of 16 nonionic surfactants containing ethylene oxide, ester, and ether functional groups against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). 12:0 MG ester and 6-12 diol, which showed antibacterial activity against both Staphylococci, had compact hydrophilic groups with low polarity. In contrast, 12:0 PEG-10 ester and 12:0 Sor ester, which showed antibacterial activity only against S. aureus, had large hydrophilic groups and high polarity. These results suggest that the hydrophilicity and polarity of the surfactant may be involved in its antibacterial behavior against Staphylococci. These findings will be useful in the design of surfactant molecules and in the development of cosmetics and body cleansers that exhibit antibacterial activity only against S. aureus.

Patients diagnosed with malignant bone tumors from 2000 to 2019 were included and their characteristics were retrospectively described. The limited-duration prevalence, annual age-adjusted incidence and mortality were calculated, and the annual percentage changes were analyzed to quantify the rate change. Finally, observed survival and relative survival rate were illustrated. Subgroup analysis across tumor type, age, gender, tumor Grade, primary tumor site and stage was also performed. As for results, a total of 11 655 eligible patients with malignant bone tumor were selected. Osteosarcoma was the most common tumor type, followed by chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and chordoma. The estimated limited-duration prevalence of malignant bone tumors increased from 2000 (0.00069%) to 2018 (0.00749%). Steady age-adjusted incidence was observed in all patients during the study period while the highest rate occurred in osteosarcoma. Mortality rates differed in subgroups while elder patients (older than 64 years) presented the highest mortality rate compared to other age groups. In all bone tumors, the 10-year observed survival and relative survival rates were 58.0% and 61.9%, respectively. Chondrosarcoma patients had the best survival outcome, followed by osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, chordoma and other bone tumors. In conclusion, different epidemiologic performance in incidence and mortality was observed across tumor type as well as other demographic and clinicopathological variables, which provide potential suggestion for further adjustment of medical resource.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related changes in physical activity exacerbated existing barriers to participation in adaptive sports. There is limited literature assessing the potentially disproportionate effect of pandemic-related changes to physical activity in IWDs. Objective: To determine how golf benefits IWDs and understand the effect of changes to golfing habits during the pandemic. Design: A survey was distributed to all registered players (n = 1759) of the European Disabled Golf Association (April 2021). It assessed participants ' demographic information (age, sex, race/ethnicity, nationality, impairment, golf handicap), golf habits before/after the pandemic, and perceived impact of golf and COVID19-related golf restrictions to physical/mental health and quality of life (QoL). Setting: European Disabled Golf Association (EDGA) worldwide database. Patients: Responses were received from 171 IWDs representing 24 countries. Age 18 years or older and registration with EDGA were required for inclusion. Interventions: Survey. Outcomes: Self-reported golfing habits, mental/physical health, and QoL. Results: Mean participant age was 51.4 +/- 12.9 years. Most respondents were amputees (41.5%) or had neurological diagnoses (33.9%). Pre-pandemic, 95% of respondents indicated that golf provided an opportunity to socialize, and most participants reported that golf positively affected physical/mental health and QoL. During the pandemic, more than 20% of participants reported golfing with fewer partners and 24.6% of participants reported playing fewer rounds per month (p <.001 for both); these findings were consistent across geographical region, ethnicity, and type of disability. Most participants (68.4%) perceived that their ability to golf had been impacted by COVID-19 and that these changes negatively affected theirmental/physical health and QoL. Conclusions: Golf benefits the physical/mental health and QoL of IWDs internationally. Changes to golfing habits throughout the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected these individuals. This highlights the need to create opportunities for physical activity engagement and socialization among adaptive athletes during a global pandemic.

In future large-scale applications, it is necessary to monitor and control the concentration of lead in the environment according to local laws and regulations. In this work, the coupling strategy of inorganic perovskite crystallization and photoluminescence is proposed for the first time to achieve the detection of lead in the environment. An easy-to-use, low-cost, and portable PVA/C(6)mimBr/CsBr ionogel (PCCI) device is prepared through solution process for on-site detection of Pb(II). The limit detection of PCCI is 236 mg kg(-1), which is close to and lower than the statutory standard of 250 mg kg(-1) in China's agricultural regulations, and is expected to achieve on-site early-warning. This work may promote the development of environmental early-warning devices in line with laws and regulations.

J	Jiang, LL; Bi, SH; Lin, L; He, F; Deng, F				Jiang, Liangliang; Bi, Shaohua; Lin, Li; He, Fan; Deng, Fang			Phenotypic and genetic characteristics of 24 cases of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy in East China, including a rare case of biallelic <i>UGDH</i> mutations	MOLECULAR GENETICS & GENOMIC MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						early infantile epileptic encephalopathy; next-generation sequencing; SCN1A; UGDH	UDP-GLUCOSE DEHYDROGENASE; VARIANTS; ISOFORM	BackgroundEarly infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) is a group of highly heterogeneous diseases, both phenotypically and genetically. Usually, it starts early on and manifests as intractable epilepsy, abnormal electroencephalogram, and growth retardation/intellectual impairment. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), its genetic etiology has attracted increasing clinical attention. This study aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics and clinical phenotypes of patients with EIEE from a central hospital in Eastern China. MethodsThis study retrospectively included the gene variants from 24 EIEE-positive patients admitted between January 2021 and January 2022 to a hospital in Anhui Province, China. The genetic diagnosis was performed in all cases by trio-based whole-exome sequencing (WES). Additionally, Video electroencephalogram (VEEG) and neuroimaging examinations were performed. ResultsA total of 24 children were included. The average age at the first seizure was approximately 5 months. About 42% of children had developmental retardation of varying degrees, 43% had brain structural abnormalities, and 64% had VEEG abnormalities. In addition, other phenotypes, including endocrine metabolism and cardiac structural abnormalities, have been independently reported. In total, fifteen pathogenic gene variants were identified in 24 patients. The main pathogenic genes identified were SCN1A (25%, 6/24), KCNQ2 (8.3%, 2/24), and TBC1D24 (8.3%, 2/24). We also found an extremely rare case of EIEE84 type caused by biallelic UGDH gene variants, predicting that this variant might affect the stability of the protein structure. ConclusionsSCN1A pathogenic variants are the main factor leading to EIEE, similar to previously published cohort reports. NGS is useful for accurate clinical diagnoses and precise treatment choices. We also reported a rare case of EIEE84 caused by variants in the UGDH gene in a Chinese patient. This study further enriches the known spectrum of pathogenic EIEE genes.

Drawing on interview data from a longitudinal study of young women's education and career aspirations, the paper zooms in on moments where concerns about planetary crises were felt in informants' everyday lives. We augment Judith Butler's writings on loss with Karen Barad's concept of "intra-action" to theorize these moments as experiences of loss in which constitutive dependencies and entanglements-otherwise repressed and invisible-touch young women's lives. Against this theoretical backdrop, we trace how such experiences interrupt performances of neoliberal work subjectivity and thereby create a potential for alternative agencies grounded in an ethics of entanglement. The paper thus contributes new insights into young women's complex performances of viable work subjectivity, showing how more sustainable and collective ways of performing the self emerge. As such, we offer researchers and professionals working with and around young women a nuanced understanding of how young women contest and exceed notions of neoliberal individualism.

In this study, we look at the reciprocal construction of national identity on Twitter by corresponding foreign missions. Specifically, we examine one year of Twitter posts from the South Korean missions in Japan and the United States as well as the reciprocal missions of Japan and the United States in South Korea. Our study indicates that tweets from the Korea-US dyad reproduce the two nations as allies, even as the United States is constructed as the "big brother" to Korea's "little brother," while the Korea-Japan dyad enacts and reinforces an adversarial relationship. Tweets from all four embassies reflect deep-rooted national aspirations: Japan's hope to be accepted as morally superior to Korea, the US interest in maintaining its position as a global leader, and Korea's desire for international ascendance through economic and cultural export. We find that reciprocal identity construction is most evident in the text of the tweets but not so much in the use of Twitter's visual and interactional features. Going beyond reciprocity, our analysis sheds light on to how tweeting practices reproduce asymmetries of power in the international order.

Using a sample of 3797 Nicaraguan child-caregiver dyads (M-AgeTime1 = 1.5 years, M-AgeTime2 = 5.9 years; 51% male), this registered report used a novel quasi-experimental approach to examine how exposure to political violence relates to child and caregiver outcomes, and to test three policy-relevant moderators: participation in a large-scale home visit parenting program, household economic disruption, and media exposure. Results revealed positive associations between political violence and harsh discipline practices (0.33 SD), but there was no evidence that political violence affected children's behavior, caregiver depressive symptoms, or responsive parenting practices, and there was no evidence of moderation.

However, the confirmation of active center and the mechanism of charge storage in COFs supercapacitors is still a significant challenge. Here, a series of Tp-based COFs with different link units have been obtained through Schiff base reaction. All the synthesized COFs exhibited high crystallinity and excellent thermal stability. Based on similar structure, electrochemical analysis and DFT calculation was used to identify the redox active sites. Because of their conjugated structures containing redox-active triphenylamine groups, the obtained a-COFs exhibited specific capacitance of 115 F center dot g(-1) in 1 M H2SO4 at 0.1 A center dot g(-1) and retained 70% capacitive after 1000 cycles. Our findings provide a new routine for designing new COFs electrode materials.

We argue that a fetal-focused decision-making framework and a maternal-fetal conflict lens are often applied, creating a false dichotomy between autonomy and fetal beneficence. Given the high prevalence of autonomy-depriving decision-making, it is important to understand how autonomy can be enhanced. MethodsWe interviewed 15 Swiss perinatal care practitioners (eight midwives, five physicians, and two doulas) and employed reflexive thematic analysis. We offer a reflection on underlying assumptions and researcher positionality. ResultsWe generated two descriptive themes: advancing and limiting factors of autonomy. Numerous subthemes, grouped at the levels of companion, birthing person, practitioners, birthing person-practitioner relationship, and structural determinants are also defined. The most salient advancing factors were practitioners' approaches to decision-making, antenatal contacts, and structural determinants. The most salient limiting factors were various barriers within birthing people (e.g., expertise, decisional capacity, and awareness of own rights), practitioners' attitudes and behavior, and structural determinants. DiscussionThe actualization of autonomy is multifactorially determined and must be understood against the background of power structures both underlying and inherent to decision-making in birth. Practitioners attributed a significant proportion of limited autonomy to birthing people themselves. This reinforces a "mother-blame" narrative that absolves obstetrics of primary responsibility. Practitioners' recognition of their contributions to upholding limits on autonomy should be leveraged to implement training towards rights-based practice standards. Most importantly, autonomy can only fully materialize if the underlying sociocultural, political, and medical contexts undergo a fundamental change.

However, often in this population the choice and management of antimicrobial therapy is complex. When selecting an antimicrobial agent, key considerations include the need for dose adjustments due to renal or hepatic impairment, managing drug interactions, the potential for additive drug toxicity among those receiving polypharmacy and therapeutic drug monitoring. Other factors include leveraging pharmacodynamic principles to enable optimization of directed therapy against challenging pathogens, as well as judicious use of antimicrobials to limit drug resistance and adverse drug reactions.This review summarizes the clinical considerations for commonly used antimicrobials in this setting, including antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents.

J	Wang, S; Zheng, YS				Wang, Sha; Zheng, Yuanshui			Evaluation and improvement of angular response for a commercial 2D detector array for patient-specific QA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED CLINICAL MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						angular response; composite dose verification; IMRT; MatriXX; quality assurance (QA); VMAT	PIXEL IONIZATION-CHAMBER; QUALITY-ASSURANCE; IMRT; VERIFICATION; MATRIXX	PurposeMatriXX ionization chamber array has been widely used for the composite dose verification of IMRT/VMAT plans. However, in addition to its dose response dependence on gantry angle, there seems to be an offset between the beam axis and measured dose profile by MatriXX for oblique beam incidence at various gantry angles, leading to unnecessary quality assurance (QA) fails. In this study, we investigated the offset at various setup conditions and how to eliminate or decrease it to improve the accuracy of MatriXX for IMRT/VMAT plan verification with original gantry angles. MethodsWe measured profiles for a narrow beam with MatriXX located at various depths in increments of 0.5 mm from the top to bottom of the sensitive volume of the array detectors and gantry angles from 0 & DEG; to 360 & DEG;. The optimal depth for QA measurement was determined at the depth where the measured profile had minimum offset. ResultsThe measured beam profile offset varies with incident gantry angle, increasing from vertical direction to lateral direction, and could be over 3 cm at vendor-recommended depth for near lateral direction beams. The offset also varies with depth, and the minimum offset (almost 0 for most oblique beams) was found to be at a depth of & SIM;2.5 mm below the vendor suggested depth, which was chosen as the optimal depth for all QA measurements. Using the optimal depth we determined, QA results (3%/2 mm Gamma analysis) were largely improved with an average of 99.4% gamma passing rate (no fails for 95% criteria) for 10 IMRT and VMAT plans with original gantry angles compared to 94.1% using the vendor recommended depth. ConclusionsThe improved accuracy and passing rate for QA measurement performed at the optimal depth with original gantry angles would lead to reduction in unnecessary repeated QA or plan changes due to QA system errors.

But there are still many concerns that need to be urgently solved for further electrochemical sensing application including improvement of electric conductivity and enhancement of selectivity. Limited by poor conductivity and low recognition ability of primitive COFs, they always need to be further functionalized. To further promote the development of COFs-based electrochemical sensing technology, here, we summarize and review the recent advances on construction of two-dimensional functional COFs materials for electrochemical sensing applications and related sensing device setups in detail, including design strategies, preparation methods, modification considerations, sensing principles and analytical applications, and tentatively propose development prospects and outlooks in future.

Saproxylic Coleoptera are both functionally and taxonomically diverse and are the representatives of an imperilled fauna confronted with the realities of a changing landscape. Understanding the effects of elevation and other forest characteristics on saproxylic and non-saproxylic Coleoptera is a step towards predicting the future of taxonomic and functional group biodiversity at the tree-line and on mountains.The objective of this study was to examine the effect of elevation and other forest characteristics on the biodiversity of montane Coleoptera at the tree-line using both taxonomic and functional feeding guild classifications.Our results suggest that abundance of saprotrophs is closely linked to the density of large trees rather than the volume of wood. Edge effects and elevation seem to drive abundance patterns of some species and also influence taxonomic and functional guild community patterns differently. Finally, we discuss the implications of climate change and land abandonment to future Coleoptera community structure.

A self-management mobile application (SMA) was developed based on social cognitive theory and the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) model. The SMA includes information about disease management; self-recording of data on diet, exercise, medication, and health behavior; and healthcare providers' support and feedback. Participants aged 19-65 years were randomly allocated to the intervention group (n = 27) using the SMA for 10 weeks, and the control group (n = 26) receiving usual care. PD-related knowledge and self-efficacy, PD-related health behavior, biomarkers, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were surveyed pretest/posttest and analyzed using SPSS 23.0.Results: Compared to the controls, the intervention group showed significant improvement in PD-related knowledge and health behavior, albumin, and hemoglobin. HRQoL domains of symptoms/problems of kidney disease and disease impact on daily activity were improved in the intervention group.Conclusion: The SMA is an effective intervention for enhancing health behaviors as well as improving the HRQoL of patients with PD. Without any limitations on time or location, patients with PD can easily use the SMA to monitor their health conditions, efficiently manage their disease, and perform PD-related behaviors. Nurses can implement high-quality tailored healthcare by using patients' lifelog data from the SMA.

Economic evaluations of nonpharmacological treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy: A systematic review	EPILEPSIA			English	Review; Early Access						cost-effectiveness; deep brain stimulation; drug-resistant epilepsy; systematic review; vagus nerve stimulation	COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; HEALTH-CARE DECISIONS; KETOGENIC DIET; CHILDREN; SURGERY; ADOLESCENTS; PREPARE; INTERVENTION; CONSENSUS; ADULTS	This study was undertaken to systematically identify and critically appraise all published full economic evaluations assessing the cost-effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study criteria was used to design search strategies for the identification and selection of relevant studies. Literature search was performed using the MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, International Health Technology Assessment, National Institute for Health Research Economic Evaluation Database, and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry databases to identify articles published between January 2000 and May 2023. Web of Science was additionally used to perform forward and backward referencing. Title, abstract, and full-text screening was performed by two independent researchers. The Consensus Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) checklist and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 were applied for quality assessment. A total of 4470 studies were identified, of which 18 met our inclusion criteria. Twelve of the studies conducted model-based economic evaluation, and others were trial-based. Three studies showed that epilepsy surgery was cost-effective in adults, whereas this remained inconclusive for children (two positive, three negative). Three studies showed negative economic outcome for ketogenic diet in children. One of four studies showed positive results for self-management. For vagus nerve stimulation, one study showed positive results in adults and another one negative results in children. One recent study showed cost-effectiveness of responsive neurostimulation (RNS) in adults. Finally, one study showed promising but inconclusive results for deep brain stimulation (DBS). The mean scores for risk of bias assessment (based on CHEC) and for reporting quality (CHEERS 2022) were 95.8% and 80.5%, respectively. This review identified studies that assessed the cost-effectiveness of nonpharmacological treatments in both adults and children with drug-resistant epilepsy, suggesting that in adults, epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation, and RNS are cost-effective, and that DBS and self-management appear to be promising. In children, the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy surgery remains inconclusive. Finally, the use of ketogenic diet was shown not to be cost-effective. However, limited long-term data were available for newer interventions (i.e., ketogenic diet, DBS, and RNS).	[Chan, Hoi Yau; Janssen, Luca M. M.; Hiligsmann, Mickael; Evers, Silvia M. A.

We found that Epinodosin has an effective inhibitory effect on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the potential roles and mechanisms of Epinodosin in ESCC remain unclear. We performed many experiments to clarify the effect and mechanism of Epinodosin on ESCC. In this study, cell viability, invasion, migration, and apoptosis were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,-diphenytetrazoliumromide (MTT), Transwell, and flow cytometry. The differentially expressed miRNAs were screened through RNA transcriptome sequencing. The expression levels of miRNA-143-3p and some proteins were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. The anticancer effects of Epinodosin in vivo were determined by a nude mouse model. Epinodosin suppressed cell proliferation/invasion/migration and induced ESCC cell apoptosis. Epinodosin remarkably affected the protein expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The animal experiments demonstrated that Epinodosin could attenuate the growth of ESCC tumors in nude mice. The expression of p53, Bim, and Bax was upregulated, while that of Bcl-2 was downregulated in tumor tissues. In conclusion, Epinodosin suppresses cell viability/invasion/migration, while induces ESCC cell apoptosis by mediating miRNA-143-3p and Bcl-2, and can markedly attenuate the growth of ESCC tumors in nude mice.

Eligible participants were aged = 18 years, with a routine check-up in 2019 (N = 21 771 683) and complete height, weight, sex and region data. The unadjusted prevalence rates of overweight/obesity were calculated by age, sex and region. In addition, the nationwide prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were standardized according to the 2010 China census by age group and sex. The prevalence of obesity-related complications by body mass index (BMI) groups was calculated using logistic regression.Results There were 15 770 094 eligible participants (median age 40 years; mean BMI 24.1 kg/m(2); 52.8% male). By Chinese BMI classification, 34.8% were overweight and 14.1% were obese. Overweight and obesity were more prevalent in male than female participants (standardized: overweight 40.2% vs. 27.4%; obesity 17.6% vs. 9.6%, respectively). The prevalence of assessed complications was higher in participants with overweight/obesity versus those with normal BMI (P < 0.001 for trends). The most prevalent complications in participants with overweight/obesity were fatty liver disease, prediabetes, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. The number of complications increased with higher BMI.Conclusions Overweight/obesity and related complications are highly prevalent in this population. These data may better inform management and prevention public health strategies in China.

Biological life-history and farming scenarios of marine aquaculture to help reduce wild marine fishing pressure	FISH AND FISHERIES			English	Article; Early Access						ecosystem-based management; food security; integrated systems; MSY; sustainable development	NATURAL MORTALITY; FORAGE FISH; BROODSTOCK MANAGEMENT; BLUEFIN TUNA; FISHERIES; FUTURE; DOMESTICATION; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; ECOSYSTEMS	Aquaculture (freshwater and marine) has largely supplemented fisheries, but in theory could help reduce fishing pressure on wild stocks. Although not the sole factors, some potential benefits depend on aquaculture pressures on fished species, including collection of wild 'seed' material-earlier to later life stages-for rearing in captivity and the capacity of aquaculture to increase. Here we first classify 203 marine (saltwater and brackish) animal species as being produced by either open-cycle capture-based aquaculture (CBA) or closed-cycle domesticated aquaculture (DA)-based on their likely reliance on wild seed-and assess the extent to which these forms of aquaculture could support seafood production and greater wild biomass. Using a data-limited modelling approach, we find evidence that current aquaculture practices are not necessarily helping reduce fishing to sustainable levels for their wild counterparts-consistent with emerging scientific research. However, if some wild capture species (87 equivalent spp.) were instead produced through CBA, almost a million extra tonnes could theoretically be left in the wild, without reducing seafood production. Alternatively, if reliance on wild seed inputs is further reduced by shifting to DA production, then a little less than doubling of aquaculture of the overexploited species in our study could help fill the 'production gap' to support fishing at maximum sustainable levels. While other ecological (e.g. escapes), social and economic considerations (e.g. market substitution) are important, we focused on a critical biological linkage between wild fisheries and aquaculture that provides another aspect on how to improve management alignment of the sectors.

B. falcatum was continuously cultivated and intensively chemically fertilized in order to attain a high yield, which reduced the soil quality and caused continuous cropping problems. Thus, there is a significant impact on S. baicalensis yield and quality. To solve this problem, soil with 0 or 3 continuous cropping years (0- and 3-year soil) was fertilized with several organic materials, which are Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus mucilaginosus, humic acid fertilizer, biochar, and vermicompost. The experiment examined the effectiveness of B. falcatum's growth and nutrient uptake under various organic materials. It was shown that organic materials improved soil fertility and promoted the growth and nutrient uptake of B. falcatum. The combination of vermicompost and biochar had a better improvement effect. It increased soil nutrients by 23.8%-73.3% (0-year soil) and 24.6%-71.1% (3-year soil), respectively. In two types of soil, both microbial number and enzyme activity substantially increased. The B. falcatum shoot and root biomass with vermicompost was increased 74.8%-84.5% (without biochar) and 41.8%-71.1% (with biochar) in two types of soil. Vermicompost and biochar also significantly promoted the root development of B. falcatum. The root length increased by 13.3%-66.7%, the root diameter by 38.6%-84.8%, the root volume by 8.4%-61.3%, and the specific root length varied by -171.9% to 3.1% when compared with the control. The nutrient (N, P, and K) concentrations in shoots and roots changed from -3.9% to 67.2% and from 1.4% to 53.5%. All the findings demonstrated that long-term continuous cropping caused cropping obstacles, deteriorated soil quality, and inhibited the B. falcatum growth. Applying organic fertilizers, such as vermicompost and biochar, can help to improve soil quality, increase soil nutrients, promote the growth and nutrient absorption of B. falcatum, and eliminate continuous cropping obstacles.

For instance, episcleral plaques (EPs) for the treatment of uveal melanoma, are designed according to generic population approximations. However, more personalized implants can enhance treatment precision through better adjustment of dose profiles to the contours of cancerous tissues. An original approach integrating biomedical imaging, 3D printing, radioactivity painting, and biomedical imaging, is developed as a workflow for the development of tumor shape-specific BT implants. First, computer-aided design plans of EP are prepared according to guidelines prescribed by the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study protocol. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a high-performance polymer suitable for permanent implants, is used to 3D-print plaques and the geometrical accuracy of the printed design is evaluated by imaging. The possibility to modulate the dose distribution in a tridimensional manner is demonstrated by painting the inner surfaces of the EPs with radioactive 103Pd, followed by dose profile measurements. The possibility to modulate dose distributions generated by these 3D-printed plaques through radioactivity painting is therefore confirmed. Ex vivo surgical tests on human eyeballs are performed as an assessment of manipulation ease. Overall, this work provides a solution for the fabrication of tumor-specific radioactive implants requiring higher dose precision.

In recent years, low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-A) has been implemented for PAD treatment. However, it has not been possible to ensure insurance coverage for patients with lower LDL levels than 140 mg/dL under cholesterol-lowering drugs. Rheocarna is a novel adsorption-type blood purification device for the treatment of CLTI by adsorbing LDL and fibrinogen (Fib) that is not constrained by hypercholesterolemia and is not amenable to or nonresponsive to revascularization surgery. The only requirements for use are that the blood flow rate increases up to 200 mL/min gradually.Methods: To evaluate the applicability of this treatment procedure, we compared the removal rates of Fib and LDL following Rheocarna therapy using various blood treatment volumes (6, 10.5, and 19.5 L).Results: Fib and LDL removal rates were about 20% and 15%-25% per treatment, with no significant differences between treatment volumes. Following treatment with Rheocarna, blood pressure tends to decrease at first, which later increases, and the higher the treatment volume, the longer the time of low blood pressure tended to be.Conclusion: Although no significant difference was found in the removal rate of Fib and LDL in response to increase volume to 6 L or beyond in this study, the 6 L volume is considered effective enough for the removal of Fib and LDL.

Construction of organic cycles from thioalkynes attracted increasing attention due to the facile access of thioalkynes. 2H-Azirines were synthesized successfully from thioalkynyl oxime ethers. Cyclobutanes were formed through chiral titanium catalyzed cycloaddition of thioalkynes. Cyclopentenes were afforded by annulation of thioalkynes. Thioalkynes could be also applied to synthesize thiophenes, oxazoles, benzo[b]thiophenes, 2H-chromenes, 2-phenylbenzothiazoles, diazacyclobutene, etc. In this review, construction of organic cycles from thioalkynes were highlighted. Firstly, the property and application of organic cyclic compounds were simply introduced. After presenting the general methods to access organic cycles, applications of thioalkynes as synthons to prepare organic cycles were classified and presented in detail. Based on different kinds of organic cycles obtained from thioalkynes, organic reactions for synthesis of three-, four-, five-, six-membered as well as fused cycles would be summarized and the plausible reaction mechanisms could be presented if available.

As a result, removal of invasive species is a common practice although long-lasting success is rare. In order to effectively conserve and manage invaded forests, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that drive shrub invasion, that is, high propagule pressure, low native resistance and exploitation of empty niches. To gain a deeper understanding of the invasion process in forest ecosystems we conducted a meta-analysis of the work done in this topic. We collected data on invasive species and native community performance, and on the abiotic conditions of forest understories under low and high levels of shrub invasion. We analysed data from 124 articles that yielded 377 unique observations. Our results revealed that while invader performance did not vary by the mechanism of invasion, the impact on the native community was significantly detrimental when invasion occurred via low biotic resistance, and only marginally significant via propagule pressure. Invasive species performance was associated with increases in light availability, but not with other resources (soil water or nutrients). When assessing impact on native performance as a function of invasive performance, results were again only significant under the low biotic resistance mechanism. Lastly, impacts were stronger when invasion took place by a single invader. Synthesis and applications. Taken together, these results suggest that restoration efforts should focus on (i) increasing the presence of strong native competitors or functionally diverse native communities, (ii) decreasing sources of invasive shrub propagules while keeping the canopies closed when invasion occurs via high propagule pressure, (iii) avoiding management techniques that degrade or diminish canopy cover and (iv) prioritizing management of forest understories dominated by particularly impactful invasive shrubs.

Patterns of metastatic progression and association with clinical outcomes in canine osteosarcoma: A necropsy study of 83 dogs	VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						canine; metastasis; osteosarcoma; transcriptional profiling	STAGE-III OSTEOSARCOMA; CANCER; AMPUTATION; CHEMOTHERAPY; CARBOPLATIN; PROGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; AUTOPSY; CELLS; TIME	Osteosarcoma is a highly metastatic primary bone tumour that occurs spontaneously in both pet dogs and humans. Patterns of metastasis to organs beyond the most common site (lung) are poorly characterised and it is unknown whether specific associations between patterns of metastatic progression and patient features exist. This retrospective study characterised the necropsy findings of 83 dogs receiving standardised therapy and clinical monitoring in a prospective clinical trial setting to document patterns of metastasis and correlate outcomes with these patterns and other patient and tumour-specific factors. A total of 20 different sites of metastasis were documented, with lung as the most common site, followed by bone, kidney, liver, and heart. Two distinct clusters of dogs were identified based on patterns of metastasis. There was no significant association between site of enrollment, trial arm, sex, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, or tumour location and clinical outcomes. A second cancer type was identified at necropsy in 10 dogs (10/83; 12%). These data showcase the extensive nature of osteosarcoma metastasis beyond the lung and provide a benchmark for clinical monitoring of the disease.

J	Vandenbroucke, S; Kantorowicz, J; Erkens, Y				Vandenbroucke, Sarah; Kantorowicz, Jaroslaw; Erkens, Yvonne			Decoding supplier codes of conduct with content and text as data approaches	CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Early Access						corporate self-regulation; global supply chains; international labor rights; supplier codes of conduct	CORPORATE CODES; ETHICAL CODES; COMPANIES; QUALITY	This study analyzes supplier codes of conduct of multinational firms, with two main research objectives: (1) providing a description of supplier codes' content provisions, specifically focusing on the labor standards provisions included in these self-regulatory policies, and (2) comparing code content across regions and sectors. To this end, the study uses hand-coding and novel text-as-data techniques for content analysis of a large sample of 880 codes of conduct. Results show that a standardized list of labor rights is included in up to 90% of the aforementioned codes, regardless of the location or sector of the drafting company. Codes are drafted with a clear influence from internationally recognized standards, even though a minority of codes directly refer to international texts. However, the similarity of codes is limited as they differ in length and extent to which they elaborate certain topics. This latter aspect is correlated with the firms' location and the sector they operate in. The research demonstrates that European companies refer to the legal framework and international standards extensively, while American companies more often develop their corporate ethical values or focus on governance and their relationship with suppliers. It also empirically shows that companies evolving in reputation-sensitive sectors are developing more specific codes including more detailed labor provisions.

Ala-Ser-His (ASH), a new ZCP located in the cruciferin precursor, was identified from in vitro digestion hydrolysate of rapeseed (Brassica napus) protein. Also, ASH exerted the concentration value of 114.09 & PLUSMN; 0.98 mM showing 50% zinc chelating activity. The prepared ASH-Zn (ZCP-zinc chelate), displayed varying characteristics from ASH on surface microstructures, X-ray photon energies, and infrared spectrum. The geometric structure of ASH-Zn with minimum free energy was obtained using density functional theory, producing a bridge bond of O-21-Zn-41-O-32 between Ser and His residues. Based on the basic set of 6-311++G (d, p), O-21-Zn (41) and O-32-Zn-41, respectively, had bond lengths of 1.96503 & ANGS; and 1.94515 & ANGS;, while O-21-Zn-41-O-32 displayed a bond angle of 136.41069 & DEG;. These findings further promote research on rapeseed proteins providing new possibilities for studying peptide-metal chelates.

However, the multi-scale damage mechanism of 3D braided composite shafts remains unclear. The main purpose of this article is to propose a shell-based multiscale finite element model for effectively predicting the compressive and torsional properties of 3D four-directional (3D4d) braided composite shafts. Considering the relation between equivalent ply angles and yarn structures, the multiscale model was developed based on a universal tubular unit cell. The equivalent ply angle was derived through the yarns' local braiding and horizontal orientation angles, and the elastic properties of each equivalent ply were derived through the stiffness averaging method. Both derivations were achieved by creatively utilizing deformation gradient theory and Nanson's formula from continuum mechanics. LaRC04 failure criteria and energy-based damage evolution law were implemented to characterize the equivalent UD-ply's damage behaviors. The proposed model was validated experimentally, and good agreements were observed between the failure morphologies and load-displacement curves of FEA and experimental results. The results show that the fiber tension and compression damages are the major failure modes of 3D4d braided composite shafts under compressive and torque loads, respectively. Finally, a parametric study was carried out and compared with that from other literature to clarify the meaning of this article in relevant studies. It provides an efficient and useful tool for the design and manufacturing of 3D4d braided composite shafts with desirable mechanical properties. Highlights 1. A shell-based hierarchical multiscale model is developed for 3D braided composite shafts. 2. An analyzing method is developed to investigate the tubular yarn structures. 3. A large-scale torsional experimental scheme is developed.

We developed a catalytic system comprised of Ru-ReOx/SiO2+HZSM-5 for direct HDO of polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyphenylene oxide (PPO), and their mixtures, to cycloalkanes as LOHCs, with high yields up to 99 %, under mild reaction conditions. The theoretical hydrogen storage capacity reaches ca. 5.74 wt%. The reaction pathway involves depolymerization of PC into C-15 aromatics and C-15 monophenols by direct hydrogenolysis of the C-O bond between the benzene ring and ester group, and subsequent parallel hydrogenation of C-15 aromatics and HDO of C-15 monophenols. HDO of cyclic alcohol is the rate-determining step. The active site is Ru metallic nanoparticles with partially covered ReOx species. The excellent performance is attributed to the synergetic effect of oxophilic ReOx species and Ru metallic sites for C-O hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation, and the promotion effect of HZSM-5 for dehydration of cyclic alcohol. The highly efficient and stable dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes over Pt/& gamma;-Al2O3 confirms that HDO products can act as LOHCs.

Iron-Chelated Silk Microfibers as a Novel Magneto-Responsive Architecture for In Situ Aligning Biomaterial Scaffolds	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						alignments; fibers; irons; magnetic biomaterials; silks	BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; FIBROIN; NANOPARTICLES; TOXICITY; CELLS; METAL; IONS	Magnetically functionalized biomaterials represent an exciting prospect in the development of stimuli-responsive tissue engineering scaffolds. Magneto-responsive properties are traditionally imparted to scaffold systems via integration of iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), yet poor understanding of long-term MNP toxicity presents a significant translational challenge. Given the demonstrated iron-binding capacity of silk fibroin (SF), passive chelation of ferric iron ions is explored herein as an alternative, MNP-free approach for magnetic functionalization of silk fibroin (SF)-based biomaterials. SF microfibers treated with aqueous ferric chloride (FeCl3) exhibit significantly increased iron content relative to the nascent protein. Coupled with the absence of detectable chlorine traces and inorganic iron oxide species, the ferric oxidation state of the iron detected within the FeCl3-treated microfibers suggests that iron is incorporated, without reduction, at innate oxygen-containing ligands in SF. On exposure to an external magnetic field, these ferric iron-chelated SF microfibers (Fe3+-mSF) display paramagnetic magnetization behaviors that facilitate field-parallel alignment. Both magnetization and directional uniformity increase with iron exposure during FeCl3 treatment, suggesting the observed magnetic response of Fe3+-mSF is derived from the chelated iron. This work is the first to investigate the magneto-responsive properties and biocompatibility of ferric iron-chelated SF, highlighting a novel, MNP-free mechanism for synthesizing magnetically functionalizedscaffolds.

Interleukin 37 (IL-37) is a cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family that shows anti-inflammatory and protective effects in various mouse models of psoriasis. Even though various animal models are used to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis, human clinical studies are still needed to make up for the deficiencies, as animal models generally do not exhibit the complex phenotypic features of human psoriasis. Our study aims to demonstrate the relationship between IL-37-producing tissue-resident immune cells with the pathogenesis of psoriasis. The present study was performed on 28 psoriasis patients and 17 healthy volunteers. The ability of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 to impede inflammation and regulate metabolic pathways was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, immunofluorescence double staining for CD4(+)IL-37b(+), CD68(+)IL-37b(+), and (forkhead box protein P3) Foxp3(+)IL-37b(+) was performed. The proportion of CD4(+)IL-37b(+) T cells, CD68(+)IL-37b(+) macrophages, and Foxp3(+)IL-37b(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells was significantly increased in the psoriasis group compared to the control group. IL-37 gene expression was downregulated in psoriasis when contrasted to the control group. Our findings disclosed that IL-37-producing tissue-resident immune cells might be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, and thus may be a therapeutic target for individuals with psoriasis.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play various roles in tumor progression; however, the characteristics of lncRNAs in pathological responses of the OC microenvironment are not entirely understood. Through high-throughput sequencing, lncRNA expression in hypoxia (1% O-2) and normoxia (21% O-2) SKOV3 cells was explored and analyzed. The 5 & PRIME;- and 3 & PRIME;-rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends was used to detect the full length of the novel HIF1A-AS3 transcript. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess HIF1A-AS3 expression in OC cells and tissues. In vitro and in vivo evaluations of the biological functions of hypoxic HIF1A-AS3 were conducted. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of HIF1A-AS3 in hypoxic OC, a dual-luciferase assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA-sequencing were used. We used high-throughput sequencing to investigate a novel lncRNA, HIF1A-AS3, as a hypoxic candidate significantly elevated in OC cells/tissues. HIF1A-AS3 was predominantly localized in the nucleus and promoted in vitro and in vivo OC growth and tumorigenesis. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 & alpha; bound to hypoxia response elements in the HIF1A-AS3 promoter region and stimulated its expression in hypoxia. Under hypoxia, HIF1A-AS3 directly integrated with Y-Box binding protein 1 and inhibited its ability to bind to the promoters of p21 and AJAP1 to repress their transcriptional activity, thereby promoting hypoxic OC progression.

Reducing ammonia permeance in poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene) (NBR)-based elastomers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						amine; ammonia; elastomer; graphene oxide; permeability	BLENDS; BARRIER; CELLULOSE; RUBBER; NANOCOMPOSITES; PERMEABILITY; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; ALCOHOL); OXIDE	Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a sustainable future fuel for a low-carbon future. Ideally, the transportation and storage of ammonia in re-purposed natural gas networks will dramatically reduce the economic burden associated with converting to ammonia. However, the highly condensable nature and small kinetic diameter of the ammonia means that this fuel readily permeates through the polymer-based elastomers and gaskets used in natural gas infrastructure. To mitigate this issue, three kinds of additives have been incorporated into the conventional natural gas elastomer poly(acrylonitrile-co-butadiene) (NBR) to reduce ammonia permeance. The first is based on increasing the basicity of the elastomer environment, the second provides chemical reactivity with ammonia to limit transport, and the third uses barrier additives to prevent diffusion. The mechanical properties of the modified elastomers; expressed as the tensile stress at yield and Young's modulus were studied. The creation of a basic environment through the addition of amines resulted in moderate changes in ammonia permeability, with up to 50% reduction of ammonia permeability observed from putrescine added NBR. Chemical additives lowered the permeability by up to 20% with limited impact on the tensile properties. The addition of 3% graphene oxide to NBR had the most significant decrease in ammonia permeability, 80%, but also produced a more rigid material. The investigation shows that ammonia permeability can be significantly reduced in NBR elastomers, through the addition of inexpensive additives in tailored strategies.

Measurement error effects on estimates from linear and nonlinear regression whole-stand yield models	NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING			English	Article; Early Access						errors-in-variables; sensitivity analysis; stochastic measurement error; systematic measurement error; system of equations; whole-stand yield models	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; GROWTH-MODEL; PINE	Systems of whole-stand yield models facilitate projections of forest attributes, but their inputs may be difficult to measure accurately. This study conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the effect of systematic and stochastic measurement errors on outputs from a representative system of equations. Simulated error was added to explanatory variables stand age, site index, or both. Results showed that large systematic error in one variable tended to produce moderate to large percent changes in all models, particularly the height and volume equations (often >50% change). Systematic error in both variables amplified this effect, especially for young, less productive stands. Stochastic error dramatically increased estimate variability (some relative standard errors >50%), particularly in the height and volume models at young ages and low site indices. These results suggest that measurement error may considerably alter projections and increase uncertainty when using whole-stand yield models, highlighting the need for careful crew training.

Thereby, it was aimed to detect the impact behavior of the composite structures with numerical analysis program for reducing experimental tests on these composite structures. LS-DYNA finite element method (FEM) software was used for numerical modeling. The material model MAT055, which is based on the Tsai-Wu matrix failure modeling on damage mechanics, was selected for the analyses in LS-DYNA. Low-velocity impact analyses have been carried out on composite structures at various impact energies as a range of 15-250 J as similar to experiments. From the analysis of the plots, it can be seen that the values of absorption energy provided by the FEM analyses are close to the experimental values at all impact energy levels. It can be determined that the mean difference between the absorption energy levels provided from the experimental and numerical studies is 1.81%. In the same studies, matrix cracking was observed at 50 J impact energy value and full penetration was observed at 250 J impact energy. The error rate between the values obtained using the derived impact energy prediction equation and the values obtained as a result of numerical analysis was maximum 5.26%. Thus, derived equation was found to be reasonable for use in predicting the absorption energy. As a result, these values indicate that the experimental results are agreed well with the numerical results.

Our framework identifies five critical capabilities that contribute to CA, namely, firm image, labor costs, product differentiation, product quality, and market share. Using a novel bias-correction methodology, we examined the Spanish Technological Innovation Panel (PITEC in Spanish) database from 2003 to 2016 to determine whether GI practices foster CA. Treatment-effects analyses, including propensity score matching and fuzzy difference-in-differences (DiD), demonstrated that R & D expenditures have a positive moderating effect on CA when controlling for the covariates GI practices, firm age, and firm size. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between GI practices, R & D investments, and CA and, as such, has implications for decision makers aiming to create sustainable CA through GI. Our findings are also highly relevant for firms seeking to remain competitive in today's evolving business climate.

The aim of this prospective randomized controlled clinical study was to evaluate the 3 month-efficacy of CPAP used either in fixed CPAP or APAP mode.Methods: Eight hundred one patients with severe OSA were included in twenty-two French centres. After 7 days during which all patients were treated with APAP to determine the effective pressure level and its variability, 353 and 351 patients were respectively randomized in the fixed CPAP group and APAP group. After 3 months of treatment, 308 patients in each group were analysed.Results: There was no difference between the two groups in terms of efficacy whatever the level of efficient pressure and pressure variability (p = 0.41). Exactly, 219 of 308 patients (71.1%) in the fixed CPAP group and 212 of 308 (68.8%) in the APAP group (p = 0.49) demonstrated residual apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) <10/h and Epworth Score <11. Tolerance and adherence were also identical with a similar effect on quality of life and blood pressure evaluation.Conclusion: The two CPAP modes, fixed CPAP and APAP, were equally effective and tolerated in severe OSA patients.

Herein, a & beta;-glucans-functionalized zinc-doxorubicin nanoparticle system (& beta;Glus-ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC-bearing mice, & beta;Glus-ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (& beta;Glus-ZnD@M & phi;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, & beta;Glus-ZnD@M & phi; transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor-homing and "stealth" properties that are conferred by endogenous M & phi;. Meanwhile, the M & phi; that hitchhikes & beta;Glus-ZnD NPs is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M-1-like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of & beta;Glus-ZnD@M & phi; and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

While model-based planning has demonstrated reliability, it is beneficial to incorporate human demonstrations and align the results with human behaviors. This work aims at bridging the gap between model-based planning and driver imitation by proposing a constraint imitative trajectory planning method (CITP). CITP integrates artificial potential field and dynamic movement primitives, which have achieved both the ability to imitate human demonstrations as well as ensure safety constraints. During the planning process, CITP first encodes human demonstrations, local driving target, and traffic obstacles as attractive or repulsive effects, and then the trajectory planning problem is solved through model predictive optimization. To address the dynamics of traffic scenarios, a hierarchical planning strategy is proposed based on the division of planning process. CITP is designed with five modules, including LSTM-based target generation, encoding attractive and repulsive effects with target, demonstrations and obstacles, and trajectory planning with model predictive optimization. Data collection and experiments are carried out based on CARLA driving simulator, and the effectiveness in terms of both safety and consistency with human behavior are reported.

Specifically, biopolymers impact structure formation by inhibiting aggregation as a separation agent or promoting aggregation as a bridging agent. Mucus is a biopolymer excreted by earthworms that consists mainly of proteins, polysaccharides, and, to a lesser extent, lipids. However, despite earthworms' fundamental contribution to soil quality and structuring via bioturbation, the role of mucus in aggregation still has to be unraveled. AimsOur study explores the role of cutaneous earthworm mucus (CEM) of Lumbricus terrestris L. for the formation of organo-mineral associations and aggregates, a sub-process of pedogenesis. MethodsWe conducted batch experiments with goethite and CEM at different pH values and varying CEM concentrations to form mucus-goethite associations. Employing the newly formed mucus-goethite associations, we explored the (homo-/hetero-)aggregation with quartz particles as a function of the loading of surfaces with mucus-C and CEM concentrations in solution. ResultsOur results suggest that the molecular structure of CEM constituents (especially proteins) is sensitive to pH. We found that the adsorption of CEM to goethite depends on pH and concentration. Polysaccharides of CEM adsorbed preferentially under acidic conditions (pH 3) and at low CEM concentration (6 mg mucus-C L-1). In contrast, stronger adsorption of proteins was observed at higher CEM concentrations (30 mg mucus-C L-1). In subsequent aggregation experiments, the hetero-aggregation rate of organo-mineral associations and quartz decreased at low C-loadings. Conversely, the rate increased at high loadings compared to the CEM-free reference. Furthermore, electrostatic/steric repulsion (separation agent) inhibited the aggregation between goethite particles at high CEM concentrations in the solution (mineral/mucus ratio of 17). However, at a low CEM supply (mineral/mucus ratio of >83), CEM took the role of a bridging agent. ConclusionsThe composition, function, and (im-)mobilization of CEM and corresponding organo-mineral associations in earthworm-influenced soil structures are shaped by the structure/reactivity of CEM affected by environmental parameters. Formation and aggregation of mucus-mineral associations contribute to nutrient/carbon storage and are involved in the structure formation in soil.

We apply this to prove that the 3-3-3-Coxeter group is not Helly (nor even coarsely injective), thus obtaining the first example of a systolic group that is not Helly, answering a question of Chalopin, Chepoi, Genevois, Hirai, and Osajda.

Nevertheless, the optimisation of bleb formation in SRI, for the attainment of desired therapeutic outcomes, still requires further investigation. MethodsThis study analysed the influence of surgical parameters on SRI using a robotic setup. The surgical procedure was automated using visual guidance. A predictive model for bleb formation was established through regression analysis. To validate the model, we compared the clinical data's target area with the simulated SRI's actual area using parameters determined by the predictive model. ResultsThe insertion angle dominated the eccentricity and area of the bleb. The injection speed dominated the axial angle. Automated SRI increased success rate and produced predictable outcomes. ConclusionsWe could provide accurate SRI on phantom models by adjusting surgical parameters based on the patient's clinical information. Automatic robot-assisted SRI is a promising surgical technique with highly predictable results.

However, failure may cause critical situations. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and causes of failed awake fibreoptic intubation at a tertiary care hospital. The study was conducted at St. Olav University Hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Problems occurring during anaesthesia are routinely recorded in the electronic anaesthesia information system (Picis Clinical Solutions Inc.), including difficult intubations. We applied text search on all anaesthesia records between 2011 and 2021 and identified 833 awake fibreoptic intubations. The anaesthesia records were examined to identify failed awake fibreoptic intubations, the cause of failure and how the airway ultimately was secured. Among 233,938 patients who received anaesthesia, 90,397 received tracheal intubation and 833 received awake fibreoptic intubation. Twenty-nine of the procedures failed. In nine patients the failure caused loss of airway control with desaturation and hypoventilation. The major causes of failure were dislodged tube after induction of general anaesthesia (n = 8), patient distress (n = 5), tube not able to pass (n = 5), and airway bleeding (n = 3). The situations were primarily solved using direct laryngoscopy, with or without bougie, or with video laryngoscopy. Tracheostomy was performed in four patients. Awake fibreoptic intubation failed in 3.5% of patients, most often due to dislocation, problems passing the tracheal tube, or patient discomfort. The failure rate was higher than in previous studies.

Benzodiazepines are currently one of the most common drugs detected in individuals leaving Scottish prisons; however, understanding illicit benzodiazepine use within prisons and assessing the potential harm to individuals is challenging due to the lack of available analytical data on the substances circulating. Increasingly, materials, such as paper and clothing, infused with novel benzodiazepines have been identified as a smuggling route into Scottish prisons. Methods were developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of benzodiazepines using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and applied to 495 seized samples from 11 Scottish prisons, including papers, cards, blotters, powders, tablets, and clothing. Evolution in the benzodiazepines being detected was demonstrated, with etizolam being the most prevalent throughout 2020/2021 following which flubromazepam and bromazolam detections increased. Additionally, significant changes in the smuggling methods and drug formats detected occurred over time following policy changes within prisons. These data represent the first reported widescale etizolam quantitation data and demonstrate high levels of variability across all sample types, most notably within tablets (0.34-2.33 mg per tablet). Additionally, concentration mapping of a whole seized card sample revealed the total concentration of drug present (312.5 mg) and demonstrated variability across the surface of the card (1.16-1.87 mg/cm(2)). These data highlight the challenges of consistent dosing for individuals and the high risks of unintentional overdose. Increased understanding of the challenge of such drug smuggling and benzodiazepine use will aid in the development of strategies to reduce supply and mitigate harm.

This study therefore assessed poverty decomposition in rural Nigeria along gender lines. Data for the study came from the General Household Survey panel data for 2010/2011 (wave 1) and 2015/2016 (wave 3) and were analyzed with Foster Greer and Thorbecke poverty classes and the Shapley decomposition method. Total poverty change and poverty elasticity were -0.0690 and 0.1394, respectively, in women-led households, -0.0973 and 0.1825 in men-led households, and -0.1152 and 0.2906 in gender-balanced households. Between-group (0.9773) elasticity was higher than the within-group (0.1853) component for the poverty headcount, while within-group elasticity was higher than the between-group component for poverty depth and severity. Thus, an effective poverty reduction strategy in Nigeria should be gender-inclusive.

In this paper, we applied CSA to the cryo-EM structure modeling task by combining the python subroutine of CSA (PyCSA) and the fast relax (FastRelax) protocol of PyRosetta. Refinement of initial structures generated from two methods, rigid fitting of predicted structures to the Cryo-EM map and de novo protein modeling by tracing the Cryo-EM map, was performed by CSA. In the refinement of the rigid-fitted structures, the final models showed that CSA can generate reliable atomic structures of proteins, even when large movements of protein domains were required. In the de novo modeling case, although the overall structural qualities of the final models were rather dependent on the initial models, the final models generated by CSA showed improved MolProbity scores and cross-correlation coefficients to the maps. These results suggest that CSA can accomplish flexible fitting and refinement together by sampling diverse conformations effectively and thus can be utilized for cryo-EM structure modeling.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether, when, and to what extent metabolic remission occurs. MethodsFasting metabolite and lipid profiles were determined in blood plasma collected from a nonrandomized intervention study involving 148 patients before RYGB and at 2, 12, and 60 months post RYGB. Both short-term and long-term alterations in metabolism were assessed. Anthropometric and clinical variables were assessed at all study visits. ResultsThis study found that the vast majority of changes in metabolite levels occurred during the first 2 months post RYGB. Notably, thereafter the metabolome started to return toward the presurgical state. Consequently, a close-to-presurgical metabolome was observed at the time when patients reached their lowest weight and glucose level. Lipids with longer acyl chains and a higher degree of unsaturation were altered more dramatically compared with shorter and more saturated lipids, suggesting a systematic and reversible lipid remodeling. ConclusionsRemission of the metabolic state was observed prior to notable weight regain. Further and more long-term studies are required to assess whether the extent of metabolic remission predicts future weight regain and glycemic deterioration.

Eight plant species from northwestern Anatolia were evaluated for their anti-growth properties in two malignant (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and a non-malignant (MCF-10A) breast cell lines. The two most active extracts, Achillea multifida (AME) and Astragalus sibthorpianus (ASE), induced apoptotic cell death in all cell lines. The major phenolic compounds in AME were identified as chlorogenic acid, and catechins in ASE. ASE displayed selective cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells, with DNA damage repair in non-malignant cells contributing to its selectivity. Conversely, AME induced DNA damage in a time-dependent manner and displayed a dual dose-dependent biological activity, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis at different doses. Most plant species exhibited moderate to strong cytotoxicity, highlighting their medicinal and economic potential and the need for their protection.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the standardised approach to ileoanal pouch formation that we have developed in our pouch surgery centre. MethodsWe developed a structured approach to laparoscopic proctectomy with ileoanal pouch anastomosis formation, divided into 10 different steps. All patients referred to our centre from January 2020 to December 2022 for ulcerative colitis were included in the study. ResultsA total of 38 consecutive patients underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) surgery. All procedures were completed laparoscopically with one conversion to open (2.6%). A total of 13 patients had postoperative complications within 30 days of surgery (34.2%), with six (15.8%) being Clavien Dindo class 3 or higher. Median follow-up length was 18 months (range 2-30). Median number of bowel movements in 24 h at 12 months post-surgery was 4 (range 1-11). ConclusionsOur modular 10 steps approach could provide a standardised framework to surgeons in the learning curve. IPAA is a complex surgical procedure with significant postoperative morbidity. Our stepwise approach resulted in a high rate of minimally invasive surgery and could facilitate introduction of the technique.

Hence, hollow nanotubes composed of N-doped ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets (N-MoS2 NHTs) are fabricated as efficient S hosts for LSBs by using CdS nanorods as a sacrifice template. Characterization and theoretical results show that the template effectively inhibits the excessive growth of MoS2 sheets, and N doping expands the interlayer spacing and modulates the electronic structure, thus accelerating the mass/electron transfer and enhancing the LiPSs adsorption and transformation. Benefiting from the merits, the N-MoS2 NHTs@S cathode exhibits an excellent initial capacity of 887.8 mAh g(-1) and stable cycling performances with capacity fading of only 0.0436% per cycle at 1.0 C (500 cycles). Moreover, even at high S loading that of 7.5 mg cm(-2), the N-MoS2 NHTs@S cathode also presents initial excellent areal capacity of 7.80 mAh cm(-2) at 0.2 C. This study offers feasible guidance for designing advanced MoS2-based cathode materials in LSBs.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the stability-indicating capacity of an analytical method for Eugenia uniflora, enhance understanding of the stability of myricitrin, and assess the effect of degradation of spray-dried extract (SDE) on antioxidant and antifungal activities. Validation of the stability-indicating method was carried out through a forced degradation study of SDE and standard myricitrin. The antioxidant and antifungal activities of SDE were evaluated both before and after degradation. The quantification method described was found to be both accurate and precise in measuring myricitrin levels in SDE from E. uniflora, with excellent selectivity that confirmed its stability-indicating capability. The forced degradation study revealed that the marker myricitrin is sensitive to hydrolysis, but generally stable under other stress conditions. By contrast, the standard myricitrin displayed greater susceptibility to degradation under forced degradation conditions. Analysis of the antioxidant activity of SDE before and after degradation showed a negative impact in this activity due to degradation, while no significant effect was observed on antifungal activity. The method described can be a valuable tool in the quality control of E. uniflora, and the findings can assist in determining the optimal conditions and storage of products derived from this species.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who received a primary prevention ICD between 2010 and 2016 were identified using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry. Trends in ICD utilization and patient characteristics were assessed over time. Using linked Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service claims data, Cox proportional hazard models assessed factors associated with mortality and postdischarge hospitalization for cardiac arrest/ventricular arrhythmia. Of 5571 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 1511 (27.1%) were >= 65 years old. ICD utilization increased over time in all age groups. There were no changes in the prevalence of risk factors for sudden cardiac death over time. The variables most strongly associated with postdischarge mortality were older age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.80 [95% CI, 1.47-2.21]), New York Heart Association class (III/IV versus I/II aHR 2.17 [95% CI, 1.57-2.98]), and left ventricular ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction <= 35% versus >50% aHR 2.34 [95% CI, 1.58-3.48]; left ventricular ejection fraction 36%-50% versus >50% aHR 2.98 [95% CI, 2.02-4.40]), while history of onsustained ventricular tachycardia (aHR 2.38 [95% CI, 1.62-3.51]) and New York Heart Assnociation class (III/IV versus I/II aHR 1.84 [95% CI, 1.22-2.78]) were strongly associated with hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia/cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Primary prevention ICD utilization in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy increased over time, including among those >= 65 years old. Among older patients, the strongest risk factors for hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia/cardiac arrest following ICD implantation were history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and New York Heart Association class.

Despite the complex mechanical conditions surrounding the collagen hydrogels, previous studies mostly focus on analyzing the mechanical behavior under dynamically varying compressive or shear loads, but the tensile properties at the quasistatic time scale are relatively less studied. This work aims to investigate the quasistatic tensile behavior of reconstituted collagen hydrogels under uniaxial tensile stresses. The evolution of the collagen fiber network structures with straining is visually observed using the confocal microscope equipped with the tensile strain actuator. While the unfolding of the initially undulated fibers accommodates the early-stage strains, the deformation mechanism continuously changes to the stretching of fibers through the network alignment to the tensile direction. This transition commences with the buckling of a fiber lying transverse to the loading direction, which otherwise locks the rotation of adjacent fibers.

NLP is innovative in this context and promises of reducing test cases creation time and simplifying understanding for "non-developer" software testers as well. Recently, many vendors have launched on the market many proposals of NLP-based tools and testing frameworks but their superiority has never been empirically validated. This paper investigates the adoption of NLP-based test automation in the web context with a series of case studies conducted to compare the costs of the NLP testing approach-measured in terms of test cases development and test cases evolution-with respect to more consolidated approaches, that is, programmable (or script-based) testing and capture & replay testing. The results of our study show that NLP-based test automation appears to be competitive for small- to medium-sized test suites such as those considered in our empirical study. It minimizes the total cumulative cost (development and evolution) and does not require software testers with programming skills.

Radiation therapy techniques provide precise and spatially accurate radiation delivery, which facilitates treating tumors in more anatomic locations and incorporating hypofractionated protocols. The purpose of this update is to aid radiation oncology teams in capturing and grading clinically relevant data that impacts the decision-making process in everyday practice and the assessment of clinical trials involving radiation therapy. A dedicated committee initially updated the criteria to include more anatomical sites and grades to characterize a broad spectrum of possible radiation-induced acute and late tissue changes. Through the revision process, which solicited and incorporated feedback from all radiation oncologists within the American College of Veterinary Radiology (ACVR) and specialists outside the ACVR, the authors endeavored to create a grading structure reflective of clinical decision-making in daily radiation oncology. The updated VRTOG v2 toxicity criteria guideline complements the updated Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (VCOG-CTCAE v2) guidelines. Because radiation oncology continues to progress rapidly, the VRTOG toxicity criteria should be regularly updated as adverse event data that will be collected following this update further informs the practice of radiation oncology.

Unlike SLC35A2, whose specificity for UDP-Gal is well-established, the UDP-GlcNAc transporting activity initially attributed to SLC35A3 has recently been put into question. In this study, we constructed two hybrid proteins (SLC35A2-SLC35A3 and SLC35A3-SLC35A2) and expressed them in a previously generated SLC35A2/SLC35A3 double knockout HEK293T cell line. Our idea was to force equivalent stoichiometry of the two proteins in the cells in order to reproduce the behavior of the SLC35A2/SLC35A3 complexes in the Golgi membrane. The hybrid proteins were able to fully restore glycosylation in the double knockout. In contrast, the expression of SLC35A3 alone in these cells improved galactosylation only to a limited extent. Our study shows that the proper glycosylation requires a balanced cooperation between SLC35A2 and SLC35A3.

However, a systematic to evaluate the efficacy of active NIBS versus sham stimulation in reducing body weight and food cravings in patients with obesity is not available. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Control Trial between January 1990 and February 2022. Mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome variables with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to examine the effects of NIBS on body weight and body mass index (BMI), whereas the hedges's g test was used to measure the effects on food craving. Nineteen RCTs involving 571 participants were included in this study. Active neurostimulation (TMS and tDCS) was significantly more likely than sham stimulation to reduce body weight (TMS: -3.29 kg, 95% CI [-5.32, -1.26]; I-2 = 48%; p < .001; tDCS: -0.82 kg, 95% CI [-1.01, -0.62]; I-2 = 0.0%; p = .00) and BMI (TMS: -0.74, 95% CI [-1.17, -0.31]; I-2 = 0% p = .00; tDCS: MD = -0.55, 95% CI [-2.32, 1.21]; I-2 = 0% p = .54) as well as food cravings (TMS: g = -0.91, 95% CI [-1.68, -0.14]; I-2 = 88 p = .00; tDCS: g = -0.32, 95% CI [-0.62, -0.02]; p = .04). Compared with sham stimulation, our findings indicate that active NIBS can significantly help to reduce body weight and food cravings. Hence, these novel techniques may be used as primary or adjunct tools in treating patients with obesity.

This study analyses the impact of text messages that make salient neighbours' savings behaviour on account usage and savings behaviour of low-income men and women in Senegal. We performed a randomized field experiment in which 2056 clients of a local financial institution were assigned to one of three experimental conditions. We found gender differences in how these text messages impact savings and account usage. Account usage, account activity and average savings balances of female clients who received weekly savings reminders making their neighbours' savings behaviour salient increased compared to those who received generic savings reminders and those who received no savings reminders. The treatment had no impact on male clients. These results suggest that content-specific text message reminders can create benefits for both the supply and demand side of financial services for women in low-income countries, thereby increasing financial inclusion.

In this study, CiteSpace and VOSviewer software are used to explore "traffic management" field by summarizing development process and predicting future research trend. A total of 3,028 relevant documents over the past 40 years were collected from Web of Science. Results show that (1) studies on traffic management were mainly published by researchers from USA (30.55%), China (20.90%), and some European countries; (2) the key traffic management research contents can be classified into four categories, that is, background requirements, traffic problems, method models, and control strategies; (3) the evolution process can be divided into four stages, that is, budding stage (1990-1994), development stage (1995-2003), calm stage (2004-2010), and maturation stage (2011-); (4) machine learning, deep learning and other intelligent algorithms have played more important roles in recent years, and connected vehicle management is also a potential development trend. Results suggest that cooperative vehicle-infrastructure systems or machine learning-based studies might be the hotspots on traffic management studies.

Small for gestational age preterm infants and later adiposity and height: A systematic review and meta-analysis	PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						adiposity; birth; birthweight; body fat; body mass index; growth; height; infant; preterm infant; risk adjustment; small for gestational age; weight	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; FETAL-GROWTH RESTRICTION; CHILDREN BORN; BODY-COMPOSITION; BLOOD-PRESSURE; INSULIN SENSITIVITY; ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; TERM; RETARDATION	BackgroundOverweight and obesity and their consequent morbidities are important worldwide health problems. Some research suggests excess adiposity origins may begin in fetal life, but unknown is whether this applies to infants born preterm. ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to assess the association between small for gestational age (SGA) birth and later adiposity and height among those born preterm. Data sourcesMEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL until October 2022. Study selection and data extractionStudies were included if they reported anthropometric (adiposity measures and height) outcomes for participants born preterm with SGA versus non-SGA. Screening, data extraction and risks of bias assessments were conducted in duplicate by two reviewers. SynthesisWe meta-analysed across studies using random-effects models and explored potential heterogeneity sources. ResultsThirty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. In later life, preterm SGA infants had a lower body mass index (-0.66 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.79, -0.53; 32 studies, I-2 = 16.7, n = 30,346), waist circumference (-1.20 cm, 95% CI -2.17, -0.23; 13 studies, I-2 = 19.4, n = 2061), lean mass (-2.62 kg, 95% CI -3.45, 1.80; 7 studies, I-2 = 0, n = 205) and height (-3.85 cm, 95% CI -4.73, -2.96; 26 studies, I-2 = 52.6, n = 4174) compared with those preterm infants born non-SGA. There were no differences between preterm SGA and preterm non-SGA groups in waist/hip ratio, body fat, body fat per cent, truncal fat per cent, fat mass index or lean mass index, although power was limited for some analyses. Studies were rated at high risk of bias due to potential residual confounding and low risk of bias in other domains. ConclusionsCompared to their preterm non-SGA peers, preterm infants born SGA have lower BMI, waist circumference, lean body mass and height in later life. No differences in adiposity were observed between SGA preterm infants and non-SGA preterm infants.

Background: Healthy Marriage Initiatives (HMI) generally have small, short-term positive effects on relationship outcomes. It remains unclear, however, which programming components are responsible for those effects and for whom programming is most effective. Method: Using two waves of data from over 2,000 lower-income couples in the Supporting Healthy Marriages study, we conducted path models and a multigroup model to address our research aims. Results: Time spent in family support services was the only component positively associated with future satisfaction, controlling for the influence of other program components, initial relationship satisfaction, and expectations of the program's effectiveness. Economic disadvantage did not moderate any of these associations. Conclusion: Results suggest that many HMI programs may potentially be beneficial to relationship functioning because of the provision of supplementary support services that partially aim to alleviate external stressors and provide personalized assistance to families. Implications: Practitioners should not only consider how relationship education programming may influence intimate bonds, but also how complementary programs may also factor into program efficacy.

We examine the vulnerability of the water sector to weather and climate extremes in rural, predominantly Indigenous and underserved coastal areas and analyze how networks support resilience. Drawing on the analysis of 39 web-based questionnaire responses and 19 interviews with rural water and wastewater managers and service providers in southern Louisiana and western Alaska, this article reports a range of interrelated historical, environmental, and social factors that influence vulnerability to extreme weather events. Formal and informal social networks serve multiple roles in building resilience. These roles include building technical and financial capacities, supporting emergency response and operational- to long-term planning, fostering data collection and monitoring, supporting information sharing and innovative research, and providing institutional support. Results from this research enrich our understanding of the social, relational, and networking processes that condition community resilience to extreme weather events.

The developed strategy featured a highly diastereoselective singlet-oxygen (O-2(1)) [4+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed cyclohexadienones (derived from oxidative dearomatization of the corresponding carboxylic-acid appended phenol precursors), followed by programmed "O-O" and "C-C" bond cleavage. In doing so, a highly functionalized and versatile intermediate was identified and prepared in synthetically useful quantity as a plausible precursor to access a variety of designed and naturally occurring vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Most notably, the developed strategy was successfully applied in the stereo-controlled synthesis of advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.

The created patterns strongly influence the wetting behavior and allow the preparation of hydrophobic surfaces with controlled solid-liquid interaction. A detailed analysis of anisotropic surface patterns reveals that the observed effect arises from a combination of topographical and compositional changes that are introduced to the surface. As a main result it is found that an individual combination of material and structure is required for the production of water-repellent biopolymer foils that are highly attractive for packaging applications.

Herein, a small amount of sorbitol was doped into carbocyclic inositol as a core monomer, and bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin were used to produce epoxide-terminated hyperbranched polyether by one-pot preparation method. After that, the prepared polymer was used as modifier to improve the toughness and strength of petroleum-based EPs. Results demonstrated that after adding the homemade epoxy-terminated hyperbranched polyether (EHBPE) to the EP, the polyether prepared with the ratio of sorbitol and inositol displayed significant advantages compared with the polyether with monomers using only sorbitol and inositol, respectively. In particular, the impact, and tensile strengths of EHBPE-IS/EP cured sample with EHBPE-IS loading at 20% were increased by 197.5%, 139.6%, respectively, compared with those of neat EP. In brief, EHBPE-IS, a member of the family of EHBPEs, provided a facile method for the preparation of bifunctional modifier for tough and strong EP with promising industrial applications.

Long-term safety and functional outcomes of delandistrogene moxeparvovec gene therapy in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A phase 1/2a nonrandomized trial	MUSCLE & NERVE			English	Article; Early Access						delandistrogene moxeparvovec; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; dystrophin; gene therapy; microdystrophin; rAAVrh74		Introduction/AimsDelandistrogene moxeparvovec is indicated in the United States for the treatment of ambulatory pediatric patients aged 4 through 5 years with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. Long-term delandistrogene moxeparvovec microdystrophin protein (a shortened dystrophin that retains key functional domains of the wild-type protein) expression may positively alter disease progression in patients with DMD. We evaluated long-term safety and functional outcomes of delandistrogene moxeparvovec in patients with DMD. MethodsAn open-label, phase 1/2a, nonrandomized controlled trial (Study 101; NCT03375164) enrolled ambulatory males, & GE;4 to <8 years old, with DMD. Patients received a single intravenous infusion (2.0 x 10(14) vg/kg by supercoiled quantitative polymerase chain reaction) of delandistrogene moxeparvovec and prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) 1 day before to 30 days after treatment. The primary endpoint was safety. Functional outcomes were change from baseline in North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and timed function tests. ResultsFour patients (mean age, 5.1 years) were enrolled. There were 18 treatment-related adverse events; all occurred within 70 days posttreatment and resolved. Mean NSAA total score increased from 20.5 to 27.5, baseline to year 4, with a mean (standard deviation) change of +7.0 (2.9). Post hoc analysis demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 9-point difference in NSAA score, relative to a propensity-score-weighted external control cohort (least-squares mean [standard error] = 9.4 [3.4]; P = .0125). DiscussionGene transfer therapy with delandistrogene moxeparvovec treatment is well tolerated, with a favorable safety profile.

Nevertheless, the escalating effect of climate change shows a significant and alarming threat to the actual environmental conditions required to sustain agricultural production. This study examines the potential contribution of demographic dividends, digitalization, and energy intensity in facilitating the attainment of environmental sustainability and agricultural productivity by BRICS economies from 1996 to 2020. The study first tested cross-sectional dependence, then unit roots, cointegration, and long-run elasticities using suitable econometric approaches to explore possible links between the study variables. The empirical results from the long-run estimators stated that digitalization improves agricultural production and the environment; contrarily, demographic dividend and energy intensity contribute to environmental degradation. Furthermore, the long-term improvement of agricultural production is supported by demographic dividend, GDP per capita, energy intensity, and digitalization. Also, the study reached a broad inference emphasizing bidirectional causal associations between demographic dividend, energy intensity, GDP per capita, the environment, and agricultural production. In conclusion, the study has identified robust policy options for BRICS economies that can serve as valuable guidance for policymakers in making informed decisions and implementing effective practices.

J	Quan, LJ; Ye, L; Li, JT; Yuan, K; Chang, HJ				Quan, Lijuan; Ye, Lin; Li, Juntao; Yuan, Kun; Chang, Hongjuan			Anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses under the stress of flooding and the COVID-19 pandemic	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						anxiety; COVID-19; depression; flood disaster; nurses; pandemic; stress		AimThis study investigated anxiety, depression, and stress and their influencing factors among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the flood in Henan Province, China. It aimed to provide the theoretical foundation for the management of relevant hospital departments, improvement of nursing quality, implementation of antiepidemic work, and other relevant studies. BackgroundIn December 2019, COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China and became a global pandemic. In July 2021, unprecedented flooding occurred in Henan Province, China. Under the dual pressure of COVID-19 and the flood, nurses' mental health problems deteriorated. MethodsIn August 2021, 1229 nurses from various departments of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University in Xinxiang City, Henan Province,China were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey using a general condition questionnaire and the Chinese version of the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the status of nurses' anxiety, depression, and stress. Analysis of variance, t-test, and multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the factors influencing anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses. ResultsOf the participants, 36.1%, 10.1%, and 15.5% had moderate to high levels of anxiety, stress, and depression, respectively. Moreover, 42 (3.4%) participants experienced high to severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The scores showed significant differences based on gender, harmonious family relationships, department position, work intensity, sleep quality, physical exercise, participation in leisure activities, health status, involvement in emotion management-related training, and attending self-care-related training (all P < 0.05). Gender, work intensity, harmonious family relationships, health condition, sleep quality, and participation in leisure activities influenced stress, anxiety, and depression scores. Department position influenced anxiety and stress scores, and average monthly earnings influenced anxiety scores. ConclusionAll the nurses experienced various levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Related departments should pay special attention to male nurses and nurses with high work intensity, unharmonious family relationships, poor health, and sleep quality, and who engage in fewer leisure activities. Implications for nursing and health policyIt is recommended that departments allocate human resources and arrange schedules reasonably, encourage nurses to participate in more recreational activities, and implement emotion management and self-care-related training to relieve emotional distress, and ultimately maintain nurses' mental health.

These features can promote cell proliferation and platelet agglomeration. Herein, we studied the preparation of gel dressing by using silver carp skin collagen and bovine collagen as raw materials. Their properties and the application effects of collagen gel dressing were evaluated and compared. The centrifugal stability, rheology, and water-loss rate of silver carp skin collagen gel (SCG) and bovine tendon collagen gel (CTG) were determined. Results showed that the two gels were stable, and SCG had better rheology and ductility than CTG. However, the denaturation temperature and water-retention rate of SCG were slightly lower than those of CTG. Two collagen gels were used in the burn-repair experiment of KM mice. Results showed that the SCG and CTG were consistent with the wound-repair effect of commercially available products for shallow II-degree scald and deep II-degree scald. In the superficial shallow II scald experiment, SCG had a faster healing rate in the first 8 days and a shorter recovery time than CTG. In the deep II-degree scald experiment, the wound-healing rate of SCG on the 14th day reached 94.24%, which was 2 days faster than the recovery time of CTG. Moreover, the skin after wound healing was shallower than the scar produced after CTG treatment. Therefore, SCG had the potential to be used as the medical dressing.

We interviewed 21 ovarian cancer patients and survivors who had GT as part of the treatment process and analyzed the transcripts using the qualitative content analysis method. We found that patients' information practices, manifested in their information-seeking mode, information sources utilized, information assessment, and information use, showed three distinct styles: passive, semi-active, and active. Patients with the passive style primarily received information from clinical sources, encountered information, or delegated information-seeking to family members; they were not inclined to assess information themselves and seldom used it to learn or influence others. Women with semi-active and active styles adopted more active information-seeking modes to approach information, utilized information sources beyond clinical settings, attempted to assess the information found, and actively used it to learn, educate others, or advocate GT to family and friends. Guided by the social ecological model, we found multiple levels of influences, including personal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal, acting as motivators or barriers to patients' information practice. Based on these findings, we discussed strategies to promote patient access to GT-related information.

The economic loss and environmental and safety problems are also the most concerning aspects of these materials. As a result, numerous studies are performed by the researchers to improve the overall environment throughout the materials world. That is why, in this study, the surface morphology and corrosion behavior of pure aluminum and its alloys, such as 7S10 and 7003H, were investigated in aqueous sulfuric acid medium through immersion process at different temperatures. Open-circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization techniques were used to evaluate the resistance to corrosion of pure aluminum and its alloys 7S10 and 7003H. The current density increased with increasing temperature in the case of the alloys, and pure aluminum showed the highest corrosion resistance properties. The surface roughness measurement was performed using atomic force microscope to find out the amount of roughness of the used materials before and after the immersion process. Surface roughness was higher on the alloys than in pure Al, which indicates that less corrosion was formed in pure Al than in the alloys. The surface morphology analysis was also carried out using scanning electron microscopic data. The results revealed that the alloy 7003H undergoes more corrosion than pure aluminum and 7S10 in sulfuric acid medium, which clearly indicates that pure aluminum has higher corrosion resistance than the alloys 7S10 and 7003H. The corrosion rate of the test materials decreased with increasing immersion time.	[Alam, Md.

Radical resection is the only curative strategy, even in patients with metastatic tumors. However, data regarding treatment strategies remain limited owing to the small number of cases. Herein, we report a patient who underwent repeated robotic pancreatectomy for recurrent pancreatic metastasis originating from extraskeletal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma of the pelvis. First, robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy with a reconstruction of pancreaticogastrostomy was performed for synchronous pancreatic metastasis 5 months after the primary resection of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Ten months after robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy, tumor recurrence was observed at the tail end of the pancreas, which was removed by reperforming robotic distal pancreatectomy. Given the precise tissue manipulation that can be achieved with robotic articulated forceps, the peripheral splenic artery and pancreas were easily isolated and divided in close proximity to the tumor. The central part of the pancreas was preserved. Robotic surgery allowed safe and effective resection of the reconstructed remnant pancreas. The patient survived for 28 months after primary tumor resection. Repeated pancreatectomy with minimally invasive techniques is a feasible and curative treatment for metastatic mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.

Our predictor data are stock-level price charts, allowing us to extract the most predictive price patterns using machine learning image analysis techniques. These patterns differ significantly from commonly analyzed trend signals, yield more accurate return predictions, enable more profitable investment strategies, and demonstrate robustness across specifications. Remarkably, they exhibit context independence, as short-term patterns perform well on longer time scales, and patterns learned from U.S. stocks prove effective in international markets.

Fire severity influences the post-fire habitat structure and abundance of a cool climate lizard	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Black-summer bushfires; fire; fire severity; lizard; mega-fire; reptile	EULAMPRUS-TYMPANUM; THERMAL BIOLOGY; WILDFIRE; REPRODUCTION; LANDSCAPES; FOREST; IMPACT	In the spring and summer of 2019-2020, the 'Black Summer' bushfires burned more than 97 000 km(2) of predominantly Eucalyptus dominated forest habitat in eastern Australia. The Black Summer bushfires prompted great concern that many species had been imperilled by the fires. Here, we investigate the effects that fire severity had on the habitat and abundance of a cool climate lizard Eulamprus tympanum that was identified as a species of concern because 37% of its habitat was burnt in the Black Summer bushfires. We quantified habitat structure and the abundance of E. tympanum at sites which were unburnt, burnt at low severity and at high severity 10, 15 and 23 months after the fires. Our classification of fire severity based on scorch height and canopy status corresponded well with the Australian Government Google Earth Engine Burnt Area Map (AUS GEEBAM) fire severity layer. Ten months after the fires, sites burnt at high severity had less canopy cover, more bare ground and less fine fuel than sites burnt at low severity or unburnt sites. The abundance of E. tympanum varied with survey occasion and was greatest during the warmest sampling period and lowest during the coolest sampling period. The abundance of E. tympanum was consistently lower on sites burnt at high severity than sites burnt at low severity or unburnt sites. Our findings show that higher severity fires had a greater effect on E. tympanum than low severity fires. Our results suggest that E. tympanum were likely to have persisted in burnt sites, with populations in low severity and unburnt sites facilitating population recovery in areas burnt at high severity. Our results also suggest that wildfire impacts on E. tympanum populations will increase because the frequency and extent of severe fires are expected to increase due to climate change.

J	Maaravi, Y; Levy, A; Heller, B				Maaravi, Yossi; Levy, Aharon; Heller, Ben			To Bid or Not to Bid? That is the Question! First- Versus Second-Mover Advantage in Negotiations	NEGOTIATION JOURNAL			English	Review; Early Access						negotiation; information; first offer; power; second offer; strategy	MOVING 1ST; POWER; OFFERS; ANCHORS; CULTURE; DISADVANTAGE; ALTERNATIVES; UNCERTAINTY; PERSPECTIVE; ROBUSTNESS	For the past two decades, negotiation research has established a first-mover advantage based on the anchoring and adjustment heuristic. Negotiation scholars have argued that first offers serve as anchors that affect both counteroffers and settlement prices. Consequently, management education-including negotiation articles, books, courses, and seminars-often recommends that negotiators move first to "anchor" their counterparts. Nonetheless, a growing body of recent research contradicts this general advice and points to a second-mover advantage in specific cases. Interestingly, this contradiction was termed the "practitioner-researcher paradox," as practitioners and negotiation experts appeared to understand the benefits of moving second in negotiations, which scholars-up until recently-generally have overlooked. The current article offers a solution to this paradox by proposing three key factors that might explain the conditions and circumstances of first- versus second-mover advantage in negotiations. These three factors are central in negotiation research and practice: information, power, and strategy. Given the centrality of first offers in negotiations, the solution to this paradox is crucial for negotiation scholars, businesspeople, managers, and anyone else who finds themselves in a negotiation.

However, many existing methods are hindered by their inability to achieve microscale stress fields that align with the designed structure, consequently limiting the manufacturing of desirable microstructures. In recent years, laser-induced strain micro/nanostructure fabrication has emerged as a promising technique due to its advantages, including simple processing, cost-effectiveness, high efficiency, and large-area fabrication. Nevertheless, this technique is limited to fabricating specific periodic structures, thereby constraining its manufacturing capacities. Here, a novel laser-induced strain strategy assisted by electron beam irradiation is proposed, which successfully eliminates secondary structures and unordered wrinkles, realizing the fabrication of arbitrary micro/nanostructures with consistency between design and fabrication. Furthermore, the generation mechanisms of these strain structures are elucidated by a combination of simulations and experiments. The method transcends the limitations stemming from intrinsic wavelength of wrinkles, enabling the fabrication of isolated strain structures. The diverse structures achieved through the approach demonstrate the designability, controllability, and universality of the novel laser-induced strain strategy, establishing it as a reliable method for surface micro/nanostructure fabrication.

An important subset of the phenomena this question addresses involves decision-makers recognizing the existence of opportunities but failing to undertake ambitious, effective, sufficient, or timely action. Building on existing research on capability traps, market formation, and managing sustainability, we focus on the forces constraining organizations from developing the capabilities and market infrastructures required for sustainability transformations. We characterize types of sustainability initiatives and, using causal loop diagramming, visualize structures that enable and constrain how organizations can navigate individually and collectively worse-before-better dynamics resulting from uncertain, nonlinear, and delayed returns. Being under day-to-day pressures and deeply intertwined within their environment, organizational actors find it difficult to recognize, undertake, maintain, and coordinate necessary efforts internally and externally. We discuss research implications and directions for future research on avoiding these traps and accelerating sustainability transformations. Copyright (c) 2023 The Authors.

A convenience sample of 226 first-generation immigrants (58.6% female) of different nationalities completed a self-report questionnaire. Partial least squares path modelling was used to test a model assessing the relationship between national and ethnic identity and collective civic action, mediated by collective efficacy, perceptions of collective unfair treatment, and group resilience. Results confirmed the identity-efficacy pathway to collective civic action for both national and ethnic identity, but not the ethnic identity-injustice or the ethnic identity-group resilience pathways.

Purpose/objectives(1) Develop a learning guide for observable behaviors communicating emotional and cognitive empathy and (2) determine whether the learning guide can be used as a rubric for assessing empathy in a standardized patient experience. MethodsEleven standardized patients assessed 80 D3 students using a 4-point interval scale on 19 behavioral criteria in four domains: Initiation (four criteria); Health History and Caries Risk (four criteria); Treatment Planning (six criteria); and Communication Skills (five criteria). Standardized patients also provided qualitative feedback. ResultsStandardized patients completed all 1520 interval scales on the rubric and 94% of 320 open-ended entries. Students performed well. Of the 1520 criterion interval scales, 1242 (81.7%) were rated "excellent." Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed Initiation scores (Mean [M] = 3.82, Standard deviation [SD] = 0.28) and Treatment Planning scores (M = 3.82, SD = 0.36) were significantly higher than Health History Scores (M = 3.75, SD = 0.34; p < 0.05). Qualitative feedback also was overwhelmingly positive for Treatment Planning and more equivocal for Health History. ConclusionsThe emulation model for students to demonstrate observable aspects of empathy is viable as both a learning guide and evaluation rubric in a standardized patient format. The next steps include the development of a succinct skillset for reinforcement in the patient setting and continued discussion on what best captures core observable aspects of empathy.

Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia: No evidence of systemic inflammation as a modulator of disease severity. Could placental inflammation be key?	BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						fetal; neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia; placental inflammation; sFlt-1	SOLUBLE CD14; PROTEIN; MARKER; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; PREGNANCY; PLASMA	In fetal/neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT), maternal alloantibodies against paternal human platelet antigens (HPA) cross the placenta and lead to platelet destruction. The extent of thrombocytopenia varies among neonates, and inflammation may constitute an important trigger. A set of stable inflammatory markers was measured in serum samples from neonates with low platelet counts, of which n = 50 were diagnosed with FNAIT due to anti-HPA-1a antibodies and n = 50 were thrombocytopenic without detectable maternal HPA antibodies. Concentrations of C-reactive protein, soluble CD14, procalcitonin, and sFlt-1 did not differ between the two cohorts. There was no correlation between C-reactive protein or soluble CD14 and the platelet count, but a negative correlation between procalcitonin concentrations and the neonatal platelet count in both cohorts. sFlt-1 concentration and the platelet count were correlated in FNAIT cases exclusively. None of the inflammatory markers was statistically different between cases with and without intracranial haemorrhage. We were unable to identify systemic inflammation as a relevant factor for thrombocytopenia in FNAIT. The antiangiogenic enzyme sFlt-1, released by the placenta, did correlate with the platelet count in FNAIT cases. Our findings may give rise to the hypothesis that placental inflammation rather than systemic inflammation modulates disease severity in FNAIT.

In Study 1, participants identified a female target from 1-, 6-, or 10-voice target present or target absent lineups. Results demonstrated increasing accuracy with smaller target absent lineups. One-voice lineups led to higher rates of innocent suspect identifications than 10-voice lineups. In Study 2, participants identified a male or female target from 1-, 6-, or 10-voice target present or target absent lineups. Results revealed increased correct identifications in 1- and 6-voice and increased innocent suspect identifications in 1-voice lineups, compared to 10-voice lineups. Female lineups resulted in higher accuracy in target present lineups yet increased rates of innocent suspect identifications. Our findings indicate 1-voice lineups result in both increased accuracy and increased innocent suspect identifications, a trade-off which may not be advisable. Future research should further explore the impact of multi-voice lineups on accuracy.	[Harvey, Madison B. B.; Giroux, Megan] Simon Fraser Univ, Psychol Dept, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Price, Heather L.

J	Kang, N; Yu, ES				Kang, Namgu; Yu, Eun-Seung			Is digital intervention for fear of cancer recurrence beneficial to cancer patients?: A systematic review and meta-analysis	PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY			English	Review						cancer; digital; face-to-face; fear of cancer recurrence; oncology; psycho-oncology; psychotherapy	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOR; BREAST-CANCER; SURVIVORS; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; THERAPY; TRIAL	ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare the effectiveness of digital and face-to-face interventions in reducing fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) among individuals with cancer. MethodsThis study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of psychological interventions for FCR published between July 2018 and December 2021. We searched for research papers using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane and assessed their quality using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. ResultsOf the 2113 identified studies, we analyzed 17 samples (N = 1482) from 14 studies, of which 13 were RCTs. The overall sample showed a moderate effect size (Hedges' g = 0.607; 0.356 to 0.858; p I-2 = 81.29%) in FCR reduction. The overall effect size was 0.621 (95% CI, 0.276 to 0.966; p I-2 = 81.78%) for face-to-face interventions and 0.517 (95% CI, 0.093 to 0.941; p = 0.017; I-2 = 83.19%) for digital interventions. The difference between the two effect sizes was not statistically significant. ConclusionOur meta-analysis suggests that digital interventions are moderately effective in reducing FCR, similar to face-to-face interventions. However, given the high degree of heterogeneity, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are required to identify the most effective digital interventions and the populations that may benefit from them.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms in people living with dementia receiving home health services	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						Alzheimer's disease; behavioral and psychological symptoms; community-dwelling; dementia care; health disparities	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; OLDER-ADULTS; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT	BackgroundWe sought to describe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) among people living with dementia (PLWD) from diverse racial and ethnic groups receiving home health services while accounting for dementia severity, individual symptom prevalence, and neighborhood disadvantage. MethodsA prospective study using cross-sectional data from n = 192 PLWD receiving skilled home healthcare in New Jersey enrolled in the Dementia Symptom Management at Home Program trial. We prospectively measured symptom prevalence with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and dementia severity using the Quick Dementia Rating System. A one-way ANOVA determined NPS prevalence by dementia severity (mild, moderate, severe). Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the association of individual symptom prevalence with race and ethnicity and cross tabs to descriptively stratify individual symptom prevalence by dementia severity among groups. A Pearson correlation was performed to determine if a correlation existed among neighborhood disadvantages measured by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) state decile scores and NPS prevalence and severity. ResultsParticipants identified as non-Hispanic White (50%), non-Hispanic Black (30%), or Hispanic (13%). NPS were prevalent in 97% of participants who experienced 5.4 & PLUSMN; 2.6 symptoms with increased severity (10.8 & PLUSMN; 6.6) and care partner distress (13.8 & PLUSMN; 10.8). NPS increased with dementia severity (p = 0.004) with the greatest difference seen between individuals with mild dementia (4.3 & PLUSMN; 2.3) versus severe dementia (5.9 & PLUSMN; 2.3; p = 0.002). Few differences were found in symptom prevalence by racial and ethnic sub-groups. Nighttime behaviors were higher in non-Hispanic Black (78%), compared with non-Hispanic Whites (46%) with moderate dementia, p = 0.042. State ADI scores were not correlated with the number of NPS reported, or severity. ConclusionsNPS were prevalent and increased with dementia severity with commonalities among racial and ethnic groups with varying levels of neighborhood disadvantage. There is a need for effective methods for improving NPS identification, assessment, and management broadly for homebound PLWD.	[Lassell, Rebecca K.

Classically defined neuropathologically as subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) is the most frequent manifestation of PMD in children, but may also present in adults. A major challenge for accurate diagnosis of LSS in the genomic medicine era is establishing gene-disease relationships (GDRs) for this syndrome with >100 monogenic causes across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.Methods The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP), comprising 40 international PMD experts, met monthly for 4 years to review GDRs for LSS. The GCEP standardized gene curation for LSS by refining the phenotypic definition, modifying the ClinGen Gene-Disease Clinical Validity Curation Framework to improve interpretation for LSS, and establishing a scoring rubric for LSS.Results The GDR with LSS across the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes was classified as definitive for 31 of 114 GDRs curated (27%), moderate for 38 (33%), limited for 43 (38%), and disputed for 2 (2%). Ninety genes were associated with autosomal recessive inheritance, 16 were maternally inherited, 5 were autosomal dominant, and 3 were X-linked.Interpretation GDRs for LSS were established for genes across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Establishing these GDRs will allow accurate variant interpretation, expedite genetic diagnosis of LSS, and facilitate precision medicine, multisystem organ surveillance, recurrence risk counseling, reproductive choice, natural history studies, and determination of eligibility for interventional clinical trials.

DesignCross-sectional study; single time point sub-study of two prospective birth cohort studies. Setting, participantsParticipants in the Aboriginal Birth Cohort (ABC) - born to Indigenous mothers at the Royal Darwin Hospital during 1987-1990 - and the Top End Cohort (TEC) - people born to non-Indigenous mothers in Darwin, recruited during 2007-2009 - aged 32-35 years at the time of this sub-study. Main outcome measuresPlasma aldosterone and direct renin concentrations; ARRs (positive screening test result for primary aldosteronism defined as > 70 pmol/mU); systolic and diastolic blood pressure. ResultsA total of 255 ABC (205 in remote, 50 in urban locations) and 76 TEC members participated. Median aldosterone concentration was similar for all three groups. The median renin concentration was 7.5 mU/L (interquartile range [IQR], 4.1-12.4 mU/L) in the TEC group, 12.4 mU/L (IQR, 5.1-19 mU/L) in the urban ABC group, and 29.3 mU/L (IQR, 15.0-52.9 mU/L) in the remote ABC group. The median ARR was 10 pmol/mU (IQR, 6-19 pmol/mU) in the remote ABC group, 28 pmol/mU (IQR, 16-70 pmol/mU) in the urban ABC group, and 43 pmol/mU (IQR, 26-74 pmol/mU) in the TEC group. Thirteen urban ABC participants (26%), 21 TEC participants (28%), and six people in the remote ABC group (3%) had ARR values above 70 pmol/mU. Adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI), mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lower for women than men in all participant groups; after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI, larger ARR was associated with higher systolic blood pressure in the TEC group but not the two ABC groups. ConclusionScreening test results for primary aldosteronism were positive for about one-quarter of urban Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants. A prospective study that includes confirmatory testing would more accurately assess the prevalence of primary aldosteronism among Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory.

J	Sheng, Y; Liu, J; Zheng, S				Sheng, Yu; Liu, Jing; Zheng, Shuyun			Identification of distinct gene co-expression modules and specific hub genes in skin lesions of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis by WGCNA	FEBS OPEN BIO			English	Article; Early Access						atopic dermatitis; psoriasis; WGCNA	ADHESION MOLECULES	Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are among the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Although AD and psoriasis are distinguished using clinical criteria, the lesions of these two diseases are sometimes highly similar, making diagnosis difficult. In addition, the mechanisms underlying these two diseases are not fully clear. Here, we aimed to identify potential genes and regulatory mechanisms in AD and psoriasis patients to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of AD and psoriasis. The GSE121212 dataset was obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied. The functions of genes in modules of interest were determined using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis with the ggplot2 package of r. The hub genes were obtained using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database and then visualized using cytoscape. The MEgreen and MEbrown modules were identified to associate with AD and psoriasis, respectively, and the biological functions and pathways of genes in clinically significant modules were detected and analyzed. Hub genes in these two modules and details on potential protein interactions were also revealed. The genes and modules identified by WGCNA might contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of AD and psoriasis and aid in their diagnosis and treatment.

J	Soon, PS; Lim, WM; Gaur, SS				Soon, Pei-Shan; Lim, Weng Marc; Gaur, Sanjaya Singh			The role of emotions in augmented reality	PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING			English	Article; Early Access						augmented reality; desire; emotion; valence	ANTICIPATED EMOTIONS; CONSUMER RESPONSES; TECHNOLOGY; IMPACT; MODEL; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; BEHAVIORS; BRAND; SEM	Augmented reality (AR) can induce emotions among its users. However, emotional valence is often studied with a singular focus (e.g., enjoyment), which disregards and overlooks the multifaceted nature of emotional valence. Taking a multifaceted perspective of emotional valence, this study aims to broaden understanding of how induced emotions can drive consumers' inclination to use AR. A multifaceted emotion measurement scale was modified and utilized (n(Study1): 224), followed by two experimental studies (n(Study2): 214; n(Study3): 200). These experiments entailed a design wherein the experimental group explored products using an AR app while the control group navigated the mobile website of the same company devoid of any AR features. Our findings indicate that the use of AR instigates expressive emotions, further eliciting emotion components spanning both affective and physiological dimensions. In instances of positive emotions, at least two out of the three elicited emotion components consistently led to a heightened desire to engage with AR. Negative emotions produce no significant effects. Taken collectively, the principal theoretical contribution of this study lies in its elucidation of the components and elicitation patterns of emotions tied to AR, whereas the practical standpoint of these findings underscores the necessity for both developers and marketers to comprehend the pivotal role that the induction of positive expressive emotions plays in designing effective AR apps. These insights should therefore pave the way for more intuitively engaging and emotionally satisfying AR experiences for consumers.

Using a dyadic peer-rating approach, this study examined adolescents' attitudes and beliefs about real-world, rather than hypothetical, subtypes of socially withdrawn peers. Data were drawn from 274 adolescents (M-age = 13.23 years, SD = .68; 52% boys) from rural China. Adolescents rated each classmate's withdrawal motivation (shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance) and attitudes and beliefs about each classmate, including affiliative preference, social acceptance, prosocial orientation, teacher liking, negative impact, and learning problems. Results indicated that adolescents had pervasive negative perceptions of socially avoidant peers on all the outcomes except for teacher liking, and occasionally negative perceptions of shy peers, including low social acceptance and more learning problems. In contrast, adolescents did not perceive unsociable peers differently compared to non-withdrawn peers. Gender differences were found only for social avoidance with avoidant girls occasionally eliciting more negative perceptions than avoidant boys. These findings uncovered the complexity of young adolescents' perceptions of socially withdrawn peers in rural China and highlight the need for more efforts to support the healthy development of socially avoidant adolescents.

Protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) is a key regulator of renal insufficiency. In the present study, we explored the potential involvement of PRMT1 in SI-AKI. A murine model of SI-AKI was induced by cecal ligation and perforation. The expression and localization of PRMT1 and molecules involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1/Smad3 and interleukin (IL)-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathways were detected in mouse kidney tissues by western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. The association of PRMT1 with downstream molecules of the TGF-beta 1/Smad3 and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways was further verified in vitro in mouse renal tubular epithelial cells. Cecal ligation and perforation caused epithelial-mesenchymal transition, apoptosis, and inflammation in renal tissues, and this was alleviated by inhibition of PRMT1. Inhibition of PRMT1 in SI-AKI mice decreased the expression of TGF-beta 1 and phosphorylation of Smad3 in the renal cortex, and downregulated the expression of soluble IL-6R and phosphorylation of STAT3 in the medulla. Knockdown of PRMT1 in mouse renal tubular epithelial cells restricted the expression of Cox-2, E-cadherin, Pro-caspase3, and phosphorylated Smad3 (involved in the TGF-beta 1-mediated signaling pathway), and also blocked IL-6/soluble IL-6R, inducing the expression of Cox-2 and phosphorylated-STAT3. In conclusion, our findings suggest that inhibition of PRMT1 mitigates SI-AKI by inactivating the TGF-beta 1/Smad3 pathway in the cortex and the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in the medulla. Our findings may aid in the identification of potential therapeutic target molecules for SI-AKI.

Some metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have unique porous structure and appropriate nanometer particle size that are attractive in drug delivery. Herein, a folic acid (FA)-functionalized Fe-MOF was designed to efficiently incorporate Ori for targeting delivery to cancer cells and improve anticancer effects. The synthesized Fe-MOF-FA@Ori showed an average particle size of 200 nm with a loading capacity of 12.57%. The cytotoxicity assay confirmed that Fe-MOF-FA@Ori was effective in inhibiting the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Mechanistically, the synthesized nanoparticle induced apoptosis and blocked the progression of the G0/G1 phase cell cycle on SMMC-7721 cells. Cell metastasis and invasion assays demonstrated that Fe-MOF-FA@Ori had good anti-metastatic ability against SMMC-7721 cells. Overall, Fe-MOF-FA is a potent drug carrier for targeting cancer therapy.

In particular, nanomaterials have found a significant role in improving drug delivery and inhibiting the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. Moreover, recent studies have highlighted their potential in modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhancing the activity of immune cells to improve tumor therapy efficacy. Various types of nanomaterials are currently utilized as drug carriers, immunosuppressants, immune activators, immunoassay reagents, and more for tumor immunotherapy. Necessarily, nanomaterials used for tumor immunotherapy can be grouped into two categories: organic and inorganic nanomaterials. Though both have shown the ability to achieve the purpose of tumor immunotherapy, their composition and structural properties result in differences in their mechanisms and modes of action. Organic nanomaterials can be further divided into organic polymers, cell membranes, nanoemulsion-modified, and hydrogel forms. At the same time, inorganic nanomaterials can be broadly classified as nonmetallic and metallic nanomaterials. The current work aims to explore the mechanisms of action of these different types of nanomaterials and their prospects for promoting tumor immunotherapy.

First, the novel walking assistance training robot together with a user is modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system in state space form with control input where the control input includes two elements standing for pulling forces on two straps which attach to the chest and back, respectively, of the user. Then, based on the nonlinear dynamical system and some results proposed in this paper, a feedback control system is developed, and a nonlinear state feedback control algorithm is designed where the control input includes two parts, namely, a dynamical part and a constant part. By doing this, it is ensured that the feedback control system is stable, and achieves the main objective under some limits for the control input. A simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed nonlinear state feedback control algorithm.

Bone mineral content accrues rapidly early in life necessitating a positive phosphorus balance, which could be established by a combination of increased renal reabsorption and intestinal absorption. Intestinal absorption can occur via a transcellular pathway mediated by the apical sodium-phosphate cotransporter, Slc34a2/NaPiIIb or via the paracellular pathway. We sought to determine how young mammals increase dietary phosphorus absorption from the small intestine to establish a positive phosphorus balance, a prerequisite for rapid bone growth. MethodsThe developmental expression profile of genes mediating phosphate absorption from the small intestine was determined in mice by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Additionally, Ussing chamber studies were performed on small bowel of young (p7-p14) and older (8- to 17-week-old) mice to examine developmental changes in paracellular Pi permeability and transcellular Pi transport. ResultsBlood and urinary Pi levels were higher in young mice. Intestinal paracellular phosphate permeability of young mice was significantly increased relative to older mice across all intestinal segments. NaPiIIb expression was markedly increased in juvenile mice, in comparison to adult animals. Consistent with this, young mice had increased transcellular phosphate flux across the jejunum and ileum relative to older animals. Moreover, transcellular phosphate transport was attenuated by the NaPiIIb inhibitor NTX1942 in the jejunum and ileum of young mice. ConclusionOur results are consistent with young mice increasing phosphate absorption via increasing paracellular permeability and the NaPiIIb-mediated transcellular pathway.

A High-Performance Dual-Carbon Na-Ion Capacitor Fabricated from a Single Biowaste Precursor	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						carbon sheets; dual carbon; energy storage; hard carbon; sodium-ion capacitors	HIGH-ENERGY; PETROLEUM COKE; LITHIUM; SUPERCAPACITOR; ELECTRODES; NANOSHEETS; CATHODE; BIOMASS; STORAGE; WELL	A major limitation of sodium-ion capacitors (NIC) lies in their dissimilar charge storage mechanism of ion adsorption cathodes with fast reaction kinetics, versus battery-like anodes, having slow kinetics. It is possible to address this concern by designing NIC architecture with effective electrode strategies. In this study, a dual carbon NIC is constructed from a single bio-waste precursor (pistachio shell) by employing a facile approach to achieve a graphene sheet-like activated carbon cathode and disordered hard carbon anode as respective positive and negative electrodes. Detailed textural analysis of the activated carbon material indicates a highly ordered sp(2) carbon composition and a sheet-like morphology. The dual carbon NIC delivers a specific capacity of 71 mAh g(-1) and yields an excellent energy density of 141 Wh kg(-1) at 198 W kg(-1) (based on total active material mass) whereas the activated carbon-based supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 24 Wh kg(-1) at 675 W kg(-1). Hence, the pistachios shell derived carbon sheets with large effective surface area possess sufficient porosity for facile ion transfer kinetics resulting in high adsorption capacity, while hard carbon anode with disordered structure facilitates Na-ion intercalation, thus balancing the electrode kinetics of both the electrode materials in NIC device.

The effects of branch chain, mica filler content, and particle size in polyurethane structure on the mechanical, dynamic mechanical properties, and fire resistance of polyurethane and its polymerization process were studied. The experimental results showed that the effective damping temperature range of polyurethane material widened from 42.1 & DEG;C to 76.6 & DEG;C, and then narrowed to 31.2 & DEG;C with the increase in EBP ratio. And the maximum loss factor (tan & delta;(max)) of these samples is 0.989. The increase of mica content and the decrease of mica particle size in polyurethane damping materials make the dynamic mechanical properties of polyurethane damping materials present a trend of first improving and then impairing. Moreover, the mechanical properties of polyurethane enhanced with the increase of EBP and weakened with the increase of mica mass fraction. This research is expected to advance the development of marine coatings and address noise reduction and fire protection challenges for marine materials.

The implications of discharge time, O-2 concentration, and solution pH on adsorption capacity were explored. Studies indicated that nanosecond pulsed discharge-modified resins in 5 min of discharge time and 8% of O-2 concentration had a removal efficiency of 97.2%, and an increase of 36% compared to the raw. Furthermore, the residual Ni(II) concentration (0.3 mg/L) is well below the national permitted emission standard (0.5 mg/L). The rise in Ni(II) removal efficiency is associated with the increased specific surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups. Chemisorption played an important role in the removal of Ni(II) by raw and modified resins.

However, the absorbed constituents and synergistic mechanisms of processed Qixue Shuangbu Prescription to enhance the therapeutic effect of chronic heart failure remain unclear. In this study, we propose an integrated strategy combining plasma metabolomics, network pharmacology, and molecular docking to study the absorbed constituents and synergistic mechanisms of processed Qixue Shuangbu Prescription. A total of 34 prototype constituents and 24 metabolites were identified in rat plasma after administration of crude and processed Qixue Shuangbu Prescription. As a result, six potential absorbed constituents and six potential targets for the treatment of chronic heart failure were identified. In addition, the result of molecular docking indicated that the key constituents exhibited good affinity to hub targets. This study showed that the multiomics approach could effectively clarify absorbed constituents and synergistic mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicine processing from a new perspective.

Hugan tablet is a Chinese medicine preparation. It is composed of Bupleuri Radix, Artemisiae Scopariae Herba, Isatidis Radix, Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, Suis Fellis Pulvis, and Vigna radiata L. It has the effects of dispersing stagnated liver qi, strengthening the spleen and eliminating food to be used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis and early cirrhosis. However, the chemical composition of Hugan tablet is complex and not fully understood, which hampers the research in pharmacology. In this study, a reliable method for the rapid analysis and identification of the chemical components in Hugan tablet by their characteristic fragments and neutral losses using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry was developed. A total of 144 chemical components were tentatively identified, including 57 organic acids, 19 flavonoids, 23 alkaloids, 18 lignans, 7 saponins, and 20 others. These components may be the active ingredients of Hugan tablet. The established method can systematically and rapidly analyze the chemical components in Hugan tablet, which provides a basis for the pharmacodynamic substance study and is meaningful for the quality control of Hugan tablet.

Their chemical compositions and structures can be precisely tuned and functionalized at the molecular level, allowing a comprehensive understanding of COFs that helps to make full use of their features and addresses the inherent drawback based on the components and functions of the devices. In this review, the working mechanisms and the distinguishing advantages of COFs as electrodes for rechargeable Li-ion batteries are discussed in detail. Especially, principles and strategies for the rational design of COFs as advanced electrode materials in Li-ion batteries are systematically summarized.

Chiral 2D perovskites with intrinsic chiral optical activity and superior carrier mobility are promising for next-generation full-Stokes polarization detection. So far, most of the chiral 2D metal-halide perovskite-based photodetectors suffer from limited discrimination of circularly polarized light due to the high exciton recombination rate in single-phase perovskite, impeding the accurate measurement for Stokes parameters. Here, an on-chip Stokes photodetector based on chiral 2D/quasi-2D perovskite lateral heterojunction nanowire (NW) arrays with high polarization selectivity and photoresponsiveness is reported. The highly-aligned heterojunction NW arrays not only build up a built-in electric field for enhanced chiral discrimination, but also possess intrinsic anisotropy that enables outstanding linear polarization response. On this basis, the device exhibits reliable ability for polarization detection with a high anisotropy factor of 0.38, an outstanding polarized ratio of 1.5, and an excellent responsivity of 22.14 A W-1. These results will provide useful enlightenment for direct full-Stokes polarization detection in optoelectronic integrated circuits.

Systemic inflammatory response and mALBI were evaluated preoperatively and patients were classified into three groups based on the combination of CAR and mALBI score: low CAR and low mALBI grade (score 0), either high CAR or high mALBI grade (score 1), and both high CAR and high mALBI grade & GE;2b (score 2). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were conducted to assess disease-free and overall survival.ResultsIn multivariate analysis, sex (p < 0.01), HBsAg positivity (p < 0.01), serum AFP level = 20 ng/mL (p < 0.01), microvascular invasion (p = 0.02), multiple tumors (p < 0.01), type of resection (p < 0.01), and CAR-mALBI score = 2 (HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.39-3.44, p < 0.01) were independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival, while sex (p = 0.01), HBsAg positivity (p < 0.01), poor tumor differentiation (p = 0.03), multiple tumors (p < 0.01), CAR-mALBI score = 2 (HR 2.70, 95% CI 1.51-4.83, p < 0.01) were independent prognostic factors of overall survival.ConclusionsCAR-mALBI score is associated with disease-free and overall survival in patients with HCC after hepatic resection, suggesting the importance of evaluating both hepatic functional reserve and host-inflammatory state in the risk assessment of HCC patients.

Catalytic methods to provide direct access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones are highly desirable yet remain underdeveloped, partially owing to the high reactivity and instability of trifluoroacetyl radical. Herein, we report a photocatalytic synthesis of trifluoromethyl ketones from alkyl bromides with trifluoroacetic anhydride. The reaction features dual visible-light and halogen-atom-transfer catalysis, followed by an enabling radical-radical cross-coupling of an alkyl radical with a stabilized trifluoromethyl radical. The reaction provides straightforward access to aliphatic trifluoromethyl ketones from readily available and cost-effective alkyl halides and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA).

Objective functions based on the gap or range of the partition's components, that is, the difference between the maximum and minimum weight of a vertex in the component, have been already introduced in the literature. Here we introduce the notion of aggregated gap, defined as the sum of the differences between the weights of the vertices and the minimum weight of a vertex in the component. We study new connected p- partitioning problems whose objective is a function of the components' aggregated gap, and give NP-hardness results for these problems on general graphs. Mathematical programming formulations are proposed for these problems adopting flow-based constraints for modeling connectivity in a partition. Even if they are introduced for the new aggregated gap problems, such formulations are rather general and apply also to the classical non-aggregated gap problems. Extensive computational tests, both for aggregated and non-aggregated gap problems, are performed on a set of squared grids and randomly generated graphs with up to 120 vertices, and a number of components ranging from 2 to 9. In our experiments, we test several alternative formulations for our problems providing a comparative analysis of their performance.

Here, we show that aggregation during NP phase transfer does not necessarily result in transfer failure. Using a model system comprising gold NPs and amphiphilic polymers, we demonstrate an unusual mechanism by which NPs can undergo phase transfer from the aqueous phase to the organic phase via a single-aggregation-single pathway. Our discovery challenges the conventional idea that aggregation inhibits NP transfer and provides an unexpected pathway for transferring larger-sized NPs (>20 nm). The charged amphiphilic polymers effectively act as chaperons for the NP transfer and offer a unique way to manipulate the dispersion and distribution of NPs in two immiscible liquids. Moreover, by intentionally jamming the NP-polymer assembly at the liquid/liquid interface, the transfer process can be inhibited.

However, the molecular mechanism regulating this phenomenon is still unclear. In this study, we examined the transcriptome genes in RAW264.7 cells, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, canine renal epithelial cells, and periodontal ligament cells. The expression levels of genes related to cell migration, force transfer, and force sensitivity in the Ca2+ signaling pathway were analyzed. We observed that the transient receptor potential cation channel type 2 (TRPV2) was highly expressed in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, we used lentiviral transfection to knockdown TRPV2 expression in RAW264.7 cells and studied the effect of TRPV2 on the migration of RAW264.7 cells under a gradient FSS field. The results showed that compared with normal cells, TRPV2-knockdown cells had impaired ability for sensing FSS gradient to migrate toward the low-FSS region and lower intracellular calcium response to FSS stimulation. This study may reveal the molecular mechanism of regulating the directional migration of macrophages under a gradient FSS field.

However, the relationships among the molecular structure, supramolecular interaction, aggregation mode and crystal morphology are still unclear. In this work, we elaborate two model crystals formed by spiro[fluorene-9,9 & PRIME;-xanthene] (SFX) and spiro[cyclopenta[1,2-b : 5,4-b & PRIME;]dipyridine-5,9 & PRIME;-xanthene] (SDAFX) to demonstrate the feasibility of morphology prediction by periodic bond chain (PBC) theory based on interaction energy (IE) values in terms of single point energy. With non-directional van der Waals forces, only one PBC direction is found in SFX crystal, leading to the irregular 1D rod-like structure. Compared with SFX, the extra N heteroatoms in SDAFX can bring additional hydrogen bonds and some other interactions into the bulky molecular skeletons, inducing 3-dimensionally oriented PBCs to form the explicit F-face network in SDAFX which leads to the final octahedral structure. A simple and accurate method has been provided to quantify PBC vector on the supramolecular level in the organic molecular system, and the PBC theory has also been further demonstrated and developed in the morphology prediction of organic spiro-molecules.

Using a text-based method and a sample of Chinese listed companies from 2007 to 2021, we find that PEPU negatively affects substantive and strategic innovations, and its negative impact on strategic innovations is more noticeable than that on substantive innovations. Mechanism analysis shows that PEPU affects enterprise innovation strategies through innovation investment and financing constraints. Moreover, enterprises with a high shareholding ratio of executives and private enterprises are more likely to suffer the negative impact of PEPU. Finally, analyst attention and internal control quality may weaken the inhibitory impact of PEPU on enterprise innovation strategies.

This study explored risk factors for complications, focusing on sarcopenia. MethodsThe study explored the associations between computed tomography-defined sarcopenia and the occurrence of postoperative complications, adjusted for age, gender, smoking, alcohol, ASA scoring, clinical stage of tumor, tumor site, type of free flap used, presence of tracheotomy, and blood test parameters. ResultsOf 253 patients, 17.39% (44/253) of oral cancer patients had comorbid sarcopenia. Univariate analysis showed an overall postoperative complication rate of 65.90% in the sarcopenia group and 51.67% in the non-sarcopenia group. Multivariate modeling showed sarcopenia and smoking were major risk factors for total and respiratory complications, increasing the risks by over two-fold. No factors significantly impacted surgery-specific complications. ConclusionsThis study identified sarcopenia as a risk factor for postoperative complications in oral cancer patients undergoing flap reconstruction.

A new method, the Ce-enhanced modulation of MOFs' microenvironment, is proposed to modulate the -COO & BULL;& BULL;& BULL;Cu(II)- coordination microenvironment of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST-1) using Ce(III) as a molecular scalpel for fabricating abundant high-efficiency Cu(I) and Cu-coordination-unsaturated sites and improving the pore structures around adsorptive sites. The optimal CH-250 thus exhibits adsorptive capacities for 20.2, 28.0, and 58.3 mg S g(-1) of thiophene, benzo-thiophene, and dibenzothiophene, respectively, which are superior to most reported MOFs, zeolites, and nanoporous carbons. The constructed Cu(I) sites show stronger affinity for dibenzothiophene (-0.86 eV) than the initial Cu(II) (-0.74 eV) for out-of-plane adsorption. Further, they are far stronger in-plane adsorption interactions in DBT/CH-250 (-0.90 eV) than those in DBT/HKUST-1 (-0.37 eV). Thus, molecular engineering for modulating the coordination microenvironment of MOFs shows great potential for adsorption desulfurization.

However, the flammability of PP is a severe drawback that lowers operational safety. This study demonstrates the development of flame-retardant PP. The co-adding with various solid acids and a hindered N-alkoxy amine (NOR116 - Flamestab((R)) NOR 116 FF) affects the combustion behavior of PP in a vertical flame test. The co-adding of silica alumina (SA) and NOR116 with PP promoted the melt drip, suppressed upward combustion heat, and shorter the combustion time. The decomposition products of NOR116 induced the cleavage of the main chain of PP, and it quenched the radicals on the surface of the SA particles because SA has abundant acidic sites and large pores, facilitating the adsorption of a substantial quantity of NOR116. The molecular weight of PP was controlled to 10(3) similar to 10(4) before the combustion to achieve an increase in the melt flow ability and suppress the upward combustion. Furthermore, a small amount of a halogen-based flame retardant was incorporated into the PP/SA/NOR116 sample, and the specimens could instantly self-extinguish on the gas phase by radical trap.

The nurse faculty role: A lived experience of mentoring nurses while coping with anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Article; Early Access						anxiety; hope; mental health; nursing faculty; pandemic		BackgroundProviding patient care and nurse education in today's healthcare environment is high-stress, often resulting in high-anxiety among both nurses and nurse educators. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurse faculty is largely unexplored.AimsThe aim was to share the experience of living and work working with anxiety in the nurse faculty role during the COVID-19 pandemic.Materials & MethodsThis is a lived experience narrative of one nurse faculty member.ResultsThrough daily purposeful self-motivation and reflection, yoga, and brief outdoor respites, the author was able to strengthen professional identity, to see value in her work and to activate the personal resource of hope (Nursing Management, 52, 2021, 56; Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 93, 2020, 187).Discussion'Nursing faculty are essential to the profession' and likely experienced 'emotional exhaustion' during the pandemic (Nursing Education Perspectives, 42, 2021, 8) in their efforts to buoy students. It needs to be acknowledged that nursing faculty can experience anxiety, secondary trauma (International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 2020, 8358) and compassion fatigue, through listening to students' experiences and offering reinforcement during chaotic times.ConclusionLittle is known about what nursing faculty experienced as they attempted to support students (Nursing Education Perspectives, 42, 2021, 285). It is hoped that by sharing this lived experience, nurses and nurse faculty will understand how employing hope as a personal resource and re-engaging with their professional identity will help them cope with the significant stresses that future healthcare pandemics or disasters may bring.

The current study compared clinical characteristics at baseline and cognitive and motor progression over time among patients having GBA-related PD (GBA-PD), early-onset idiopathic PD (early-iPD), and late-onset idiopathic PD (late-iPD). MethodsWe recruited 88 GBA-PD, 167 early-iPD, and 488 late-iPD patients in this study. A subset of 50 GBA-PD, 81 early-iPD, and 223 late-iPD patients was followed up at least once, with a 3.0-year mean follow-up time. Linear mixed-effects models helped evaluate the rate of change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor and Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores. ResultsAt baseline, the GBA-PD group showed more severe motor deficits and non-motor symptoms (NMSs) than the early-iPD group and more NMSs than the late-iPD group. Moreover, the GBA-PD group had more significant cognitive and motor progression, particularly bradykinesia and axial impairment, than the early-iPD and late-iPD groups at follow-up. However, the early-onset GBA-PD (early-GBA-PD) group was similar to the late-onset GBA-PD (late-GBA-PD) group in baseline clinical features and cognitive and motor progression. ConclusionGBA-PD patients exhibited faster cognitive and motor deterioration than early-iPD and late-iPD patients. Thus, subtype classification based on genetic characteristics rather than age at onset could enhance the prediction of PD disease progression.

Successes notwithstanding, there is still a need for further improvement of organic solar cells, both regarding energy and current management in these devices. At present, there are different and mutually exclusive interpretation schemes for the associated losses of energy and charge, hampering the rational design of next generations of organic solar cells. One critical factor that affects voltage, current, and fill factor losses is whether or not photogenerated charges are effectively near or far away from thermodynamic equilibrium. While it is commonly agreed that both the vibronic and (disordered) energetic structure of organic semiconductors affect the solar cell characteristics, the degree to which deviations from near-equilibrium population of the associated energy level distributions matter for the photovoltaic performance is unclear: near-equilibrium as well as kinetic descriptions have provided seemingly convincing descriptions of a wide range of experiments. Here, the most important concepts in relation to experimental results are reviewed, open questions are addressed and implications for device performance and improvement are highlighted.

In order to explain the operating principle, the resonant property of the circular patch resonator has been investigated firstly. Two circular patch resonators connected by two microstrip lines are used in this design. A filtering coupler is achieved by adjusting the feeder position and the length and width of the microstrip line used to connect the two resonators. Without additional circuits, the desired 0 & DEG; and 180 & DEG; phase differences are realized by the inherent in-phase and out-of-phase characteristics of E-fields at the TM11 mode. To improve the passband selectivity, transmission zeros are created by introducing a coupling between the source and load through the coupling slots etched on the ground. Finally, a prototype of the filtering coupler centered at 2.12 GHz is designed, implemented, and tested, while the measured results coincide well with simulated ones, verifying the proposed design concept.

We aimed to determine the independent and combined effects of chronic heavy METH use and having at least one copy of the APOE-epsilon 4 allele (APOE-epsilon 4+) on brain morphometry and cognition, especially in relation to aging. Methods: We compared brain morphometry and cognitive performance in 77 individuals with chronic heavy METH use (26 APOE-epsilon 4+, 51 APOE-epsilon 4-) and 226 Non-METH users (66 APOE-epsilon 4+, 160 APOE-epsilon 4-), using a 2 x 2 design (two-way analysis of co-variance). Vertex-wise cortical volumes, thickness and seven subcortical volumes, were automatically measured using FreeSurfer. Linear regression between regional brain measures, and cognitive scores that showed group differences were evaluated. Group differences in age-related decline in brain and cognitive measures were also explored. Results: Regardless of APOE-epsilon 4 genotype, METH users had lower Motor Z-scores (P = 0.005), thinner right lateral-orbitofrontal cortices (P < 0.001), smaller left pars-triangularis gyrus volumes (P = 0.004), but larger pallida, hippocampi and amygdalae (P = 0.004-0.006) than nonusers. Across groups, APOE-epsilon 4+ METH users had the smallest volumes of superior frontal cortical gyri bilaterally, and of the smallest volume in left rostral-middle frontal gyri (all P-values <0.001). Smaller right superior-frontal gyrus predicted poorer motor function only in APOE-epsilon 4+ participants (interaction-P < 0.001). Cortical volumes and thickness declined with age similarly across all participants; however, APOE-epsilon 4-carriers showed thinner right inferior parietal cortices than noncarriers at younger age (interaction-P < 0.001). Conclusions: Chronic heavy use and having at least one copy of the APOE-epsilon 4 allele may have synergistic effects on brain atrophy, particularly in frontal cortices, which may contribute to their poorer cognitive function. However, the enlarged subcortical volumes in METH users replicated prior studies, and are likely due to METH-mediated neuroinflammation.	[Wang, Hannah A.

Preventive behavioral health interventions may improve outcomes, especially if interventions can be delivered at a distance to decrease barriers to mental health care. This pilot study examined the acceptability and accessibility of an evidence-informed resilience training program delivered using a video telehealth platform. A secondary aim was to assess the preliminary efficacy of the intervention on recipient behavioral health outcomes, perceived barriers to recipient medication adherence, parent behavioral health outcomes, and family functioning. MethodsSeventeen heart transplant recipients (8-18 years old) and their families were recruited and randomly assigned to a treatment as usual (n = 8) or an intervention group (n = 9). Baseline assessment data collected included demographic information and validated behavioral health measures. Follow-up assessments included the validated measures and acceptability and satisfaction ratings. ResultsThe study demonstrated that the program has high acceptability by recipients and parents, and a positive impact on recipients and parents, including significant reductions in youth behavioral difficulties as well as parent depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. ConclusionsResults of this study are promising and call for further evaluation of hybrid delivery models for behavioral health screening and prevention interventions for pediatric heart transplant recipients and their families.

Data SourcesThree databases including PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched by two independent authors from inception to June 12, 2022 for observational studies and randomized controlled trials investigating the association between BPPV and depression and anxiety. We included studies published as full-length articles in peer-reviewed journals with an adult population aged at least 18 years who have BPPV, detected through validated clinical methods like clinical diagnosis, interview and Dix-Hallpike test. ResultsA total of 23 articles met the final inclusion criteria and 19 articles were included in the meta-analysis. BPPV was associated with a 3.19 increased risk of anxiety compared to controls, and 27% (17%-39%) of BPPV patients suffered from anxiety. Furthermore, the weighted average Beck's Anxiety Inventory score was 18.38 (12.57; 24.18), while the weighted average State-Trait Anxiety Index score was 43.08 (37.57; 48.60). ConclusionThere appears to be some association between BPPV and anxiety, but further studies are required to confirm these associations.

It forms with high concentration only in very alkaline electrolytes, when OH- binds to the carbonyl carbon atom. Accordingly, the electrochemical upgrading of biomass-derived aldehydes to carboxylates is believed to be limited to very alkaline electrolytes at many electrode materials. However, OH--induced aldehyde decomposition in these electrolytes prevents application of electrochemical aldehyde oxidation for the sustainable upgrading of biomass to value-added chemicals at industrial scale. Here, we demonstrate the successful oxidation of aliphatic aldehydes at a rotating gold electrode at pH 12, where only 1 % of the aldehyde resides as the diolate species. This concentration is too small to account for the observed current, which shows that also other aldehyde species (i. e., the geminal diol and the non-hydrated aldehyde) are electroactive. This insight allows developing strategies to omit aldehyde decomposition while achieving high current densities for the selective aldehyde oxidation, making its future industrial application viable.

Estimating migration speed of glass eels during their colonization of a Mediterranean lagoon	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Anguilla anguilla; glass eels; Mediterranean lagoons; migration speed; migratory behavior; selective tidal stream transport	ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA L.; RHYTHMIC SWIMMING ACTIVITY; L DIPTERA-SCATOPHAGIDAE; DOUBLE-HURDLE MODEL; EUROPEAN EEL; REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR; SEXUAL SELECTION; RECRUITMENT; PATTERNS; CONSUMPTION	Migration speed can have important evolutionary consequences as it can affect the timing of arrival, remaining energy reserves, and habitat choice. Environmental conditions and individual phenotypic traits can impact the migration speed of individuals. In this way, estimating migration speed is of particular importance, especially for species under strong management strategies and colonizing highly diversified habitats, as is the case for the European eel. However, estimating the migration speed of glass eels, which is the life stage when eels colonize continental habitats, presents challenges due to typically low re-capture probabilities and difficulties in tagging individuals. Using recruitment time series at two sites, one at the sea connection and another inland, we estimated the temporal lag between the two migration peaks to compute migration speed. Because we worked on the Mediterranean coasts and in a lagoon, the weak tidal amplitudes may inhibit individuals from efficiently performing the selective tidal stream transport. We obtained migration speed values coherent with the few values available in the literature for Atlantic estuaries. The values we obtained that are lower than those obtained for Atlantic estuaries are also coherent with the weak tides along the Mediterranean coasts and lead to necessary further studies to understand the migratory behavior of glass eels in such hydro-systems.

Thanks to the sulfur functional group and the formation of Ti-S bond, which facilitates the sodium in-/desertion and strengthens the potassium ion adsorption ability, as well as enhances ion reaction kinetics and improved structure stability, the S-T3C2Tx exhibit excellent sodium/potassium storage performance, high reversible capacities of 151 and 101 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 mA g(-1) were achieved for SIBs and PIBs, respectively. Moreover, the S-T3C2Tx exhibits remarkable long-term capacity stability at a high density of 500 mA g(-1), providing an impressive storage of 88 mAh g(-1) for SIBs and 41 mAh g(-1) for PIBs even after 2000 cycles. This work could give a deep comprehension of the heteroatom modification influence on the MXene-based framework and promote the application of MXene electrodes.

Methods: In total, 585 patients undergoing regular hemodialysis in Sichuan Province of China from January to March 2022 were selected to complete a questionnaire survey on their knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Independent t tests and logistic multivariate analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors of COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients. Results: The survey showed that 37.44% of MHD patients had been vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Being married was associated with COVID-19 vaccination in patients with MHD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.969 95% CI 0 .870 similar to 4.453). MHD patients living in county areas have higher rates of COVID-19 vaccination (OR = 0.572 95% CI 0.301 similar to 1.087). Family /relatives/friends who are healthcare workers are associated with COVID-19 vaccination for MHD patients (OR = 1.840 95% CI 1.140 similar to 2.970). Other vaccination history within 5 years was a factor in COVID-19 vaccination for MHD patients (OR = 5.592 95% CI 2.997 similar to 10.434). Attitude (OR = 0.885 95% CI 0.808 similar to 0.905), and practice (OR = 0.756 95% CI 0.697 similar to 0.819) scores on the COVID-19 vaccination knowledge and practice questionnaire were related to the vaccination status of MHD patients. Conclusions: MHD patients had lower rates of COVID-19 vaccination. Marital status, living environment, whether family/relatives/friends were medical workers, and the score of the COVID-19 vaccine knowledge and practice questionnaire were the factors influencing their vaccination status. Clinical attention should be given to the adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccination in MHD patients to improve the awareness of primary medical staff on hemodialysis, and families and society should pay more attention to COVID-19 vaccination in MHD patients.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed an orthorhombic structure that consists of infinite intermetallic rods & INFIN;1[ ${{}_{\infty }{}<^>{1}[}$ Bi9Rh2](3+) and discrete anionic groups [(Bi2Cl2I5)-Cl-II](3-) and [(BiCl4I2)-Cl-III](3-). The rods consist of Rh-centered [RhBi8] polyhedra that alternately share triangular and rectangular faces. Using traditional electron counting rules, the rod can be interpreted as a covalent polymer with Rh-2 dumbbells bonded to molecular Bi-2 and Bi-5 units. However, a quantum-chemical bonding analysis shows that the bonds involving Rh atoms are largely diffuse, while two-center bonds dominate in the bismuth units. The below 240 K observed semiconducting behavior of Bi21Rh4Cl6I7 is consistent with a complete localization of the valence electrons. Above 240 K, the resistance along the needle axis is largely independent of temperature.

Intraoperative hypertensive crisis in a dog with functional paraganglioma of the gall bladder	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article; Early Access							GALLBLADDER; PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA; URINARY	A 15-year-old spayed female mongrel presented with anorexia and an abdominal mass. The mass originated from the gall bladder and was surgically resected along with divisionectomy of the central hepatic division. Paroxysmal hypertension and tachycardia were noted during manipulation of the mass. Following resection, arterial blood pressure decreased significantly. Histopathological analysis confirmed a diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining for synaptophysin and chromogranin A yielded diffuse and strong positive results, while gastrin was positive in only 10% of the cells. The preoperative elevated concentrations of catecholamine in the urinalysis showed a marked decrease after surgery. Based on these findings, the tumour was diagnosed as a functional paraganglioma of the gall bladder. The patient has undergone regular thoracic radiographs and ultrasound examinations and, until 431 days after surgery, has shown no signs of metastases or recurrences. Based on our literature search, we report the first case of functional paraganglioma of the gall bladder in a dog.

Despite the small monetary penalties, we still document a surprisingly strong negative stock price reaction to the news of corporate environmental violations. Additionally, we show that the negative stock market reaction weakens in firms with strong voluntary environmental commitment. But the effect of voluntary environmental commitment is less pronounced in state- or foreign-owned firms. Our study yields important managerial implications: our findings reveal considerable reputational losses associated with environmental misconducts and demonstrate the benefit of voluntary environmental commitment in upholding corporate reputation and helping firms recover during unfavorable environmental crises.

The amyloid hypothesis, currently the most pursued basis of AD drug discovery, points the cause of AD to abnormal production and ineffective removal of pathogenic aggregated amyloid-beta (A beta). AD therapeutic research has been focused on targeting different species of A beta in the amyloidogenic process to control A beta content and recover cognitive decline. Among the different processes targeted, the clearance mechanism has been found to be the most effective, supported by the recent clinical approval of an A beta-targeting immunotherapeutic drug which significantly slowed cognitive decline. Although the current AD drug discovery field is extensively researching immunotherapeutic drugs, there are numerous properties of immunotherapy in need of improvements that could be overcome by an equally performing chemical drug. Here, we review chemical and immunotherapy drug candidates, based on their mechanism of modulating the amyloid cascade, selected from the AlzForum database. Through this review, we aim to summarize and evaluate the prospect of A beta-targeting chemical drugs.

Simulation of induced acoustic emission (AE) and microseismic emission (ME) due to tensile fracturing and shear slip instability of pre-existing fracture interfaces is carried out and the numerical results of the emitted signals are analysed. The mathematical model is based on the generalized Biot's theory for coupled interaction of solid and fluid phases. A computationally robust non-linear solver is developed to handle the severe non-linearities arising from fluid saturations, relative permeabilities of fluids, constitutive models of interfaces and convective thermal coupling. To model pre-existing natural fractures and faults, discrete fracture propagation and nucleation of cracks (micro-cracking) independently of the original mesh topology, a local Partition-of-Unity (PU) finite element method, namely, the Phantom Node Method (PNM) is implemented. The cohesive fracture modelling scheme is implemented to account for the non-linear behaviour of fracturing and localization, and to rectify the non-physical stress singularity condition at the fracture tip. Effects of different system parameters on fracturing, shear-slip instability and the associated induced AEs and MEs are investigated through various numerical results.

Within this domain, oocyte cryopreservation has emerged as an important research area for preserving female fertility. Against the backdrop of the hotly debated first legal case in China of a single woman wishing to freeze her eggs, and the implementation of the 'three-child policy' in China, there is an urgent need to evaluate policies and address ethical considerations surrounding oocyte cryopreservation for non-medical reasons. This review examines current policies, explores China's practices and research, and examines the latest ethical challenges surrounding non-medical oocyte cryopreservation.

To achieve this objective, it is essential to design the key electron-deficient units with simple structures and facile preparation processes, which can facilitate the production of low-cost n-type polymers. Herein, by sequentially introducing fluorine and cyano functionalities onto trans-1,3-butadiene, we developed a series of structurally simple but highly electron-deficient building blocks, namely 1,4-dicyano-butadiene (CNDE), 3-fluoro-1,4-dicyano-butadiene (CNFDE), and 2,3-difluoro-1,4-dicyano-butadiene (CNDFDE), featuring a highly coplanar backbone and deep-positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (-3.03-4.33 eV), which render them highly attractive for developing n-type semiconducting polymers. Notably, all these electron-deficient units can be easily accessed by a two-step high-yield synthetic procedure from low-cost raw materials, thus rendering them highly promising candidates for commercial applications. Upon polymerization with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), three copolymers were developed that demonstrated unipolar n-type transport characteristics in OFETs with the highest electron mobility of >1 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Hence, CNDE, CNFDE, and CNDFDE represent a class of novel, simple, and efficient electron-deficient units for constructing low-cost n-type polymers, thereby providing valuable insight for OFET applications.

Their families are well-versed in care and can help identify safety/quality gaps to inform improvements. Although previous studies have shown families identify important safety/quality gaps in hospitals, studies of inpatient safety/quality experience of CMC and their families are limited. To address this gap and identify otherwise unrecognized, family-prioritized areas for improving safety/quality of CMC, we conducted a secondary qualitative analysis of safety reporting surveys among families of CMC. ObjectiveExplore safety reports from families of hospitalized CMC to identify areas to improve safety/quality. Designs, Settings and ParticipantsWe analyzed free-text responses from predischarge safety reporting surveys administered to families of CMC at a quaternary children's hospital from April 2018 to November 2020. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, we categorized responses into standard clinical categories. Three team members inductively generated an initial codebook to apply iteratively to responses. Reviewers coded responses collaboratively, resolved discrepancies through consensus, and generated themes. Main Outcome and MeasuresOutcomes: family-reported areas of safety/quality improvement. Measures: pre-discharge family surveys. ResultsTwo hundred and eight/two hundred and thirty-seven (88%) families completed surveys; 83 families offered 138 free-text safety responses about medications, feeds, cares, and other categories. Themes included unmet expectations of hospital care/environment, lack of consistency, provider-patient communication lapses, families' expertise about care, and the value of transparency. ConclusionTo improve care of CMC and their families, hospitals can manage expectations about hospital limitations, improve consistency of care/communication, acknowledge family expertise, and recognize that family-observed quality concerns can have safety implications. Soliciting family input can help hospitals improve care in meaningful, otherwise unrecognized ways.

Supporting collaborative dissection through the development of an online wiki positively impacts the learning of veterinary anatomy	ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						anatomical education; blended learning; COVID-19; digital learning; dissection; technology; wiki	EDUCATION; CURRICULUM; SCIENCES	An innovative series of dissections of the canine abdomen was created to facilitate social distancing in the dissection room following COVID-19 restrictions imposed in the UK. In groups of six, first-year veterinary students took turns dissecting selected parts of the canine abdomen while maintaining social distancing and documenting their work with video and photographs. Here, students learned about the canine abdominal anatomy by dissecting, recording the dissections of others in their group, and compiling the recorded material into a collaborative electronic media portfolio (Wiki). An online formative multiple-choice test was created to test students' knowledge of the canine abdominal anatomy. The result analysis showed that although students achieved the learning outcomes only by studying the Wiki, they had better performance in the anatomical areas where they learned through the dissection (p < 0.05). Student performance was very similar in the areas in which they were present in the dissection room and participated in recording the dissection compared with the areas that they effectively dissected (p > 0.05). A qualitative thematic analysis was developed to understand students' opinions via their feedback on this dissection approach. Our results showed that student collaboration and the development of practical skills were the most valued aspects of this dissection teaching initiative. Moreover, these results show that developing a group Wiki has a positive impact on student achievement of learning objectives, with a practical hands-on dissection being fundamental for the optimal learning of the canine abdominal anatomy.

To construct an aggregate bank performance index, we employ principal component analysis, which utilises a set of critical indicators summarised by the CAMEL rating system, including banks' solvency, asset quality, efficiency, profitability and liquidity. Our primary findings indicate that different measures of financial inclusion exhibit varying associations with bank performance. Specifically, there is a trade-off between bank performance and credit deepening, especially in high-income nations. Conversely, in low-income nations, higher financial inclusion, measured by deposits to GDP, number of deposits, and number of borrowers, does not affect bank performance adversely. Banks in low-income nations could achieve significant gains by improving financial access and enhancing regulatory environments.

But the uplift mechanisms of the eastern Tibetan Plateau remain uncertain. The analysis of flexural isostasy can provide new insights into those uplifting mechanisms. In this study, the effective elastic thickness (T-e) and load ratio (F) of the lithosphere are esti-mated around the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The derived T-e and F are used to compute flexural isostatic anomalies (FIA) using the theoretical Bouguer admittance method. We find the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau is dominated by low T-e, high F, and significant negative FIA. Our results suggest that this area has a weak lithosphere with heavy subsurface loadings and crustal mass surpluses. This supports that a middle-lower crustal channel flow probably underlies this region.

Here, we show that the occurrence and biosynthesis of progestogens and androgens are conserved across the viridiplantae lineage.An UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS method allowed high-throughput analysis of the occurrence and chemical conversion of progestogens and androgens in 41 species across the green plant lineage.Dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, and 5a-dihydrotestosterone are plants' most abundant mammalian-like steroids. Progestogens are converted into 17a-hydroxyprogesterone and 5a-pregnane-3,20-dione. Androgens are converted into testosterone and 5a-dihydrotestosterone. 17,20-Lyases, essential for converting progestogens to androgens, seem to be most effective in monocot species.Our data suggest that the occurrence of progestogens and androgens is highly conserved in plants, and their biosynthesis might favor a route using the ?(4) pathway.

PMI estimation relies on expert experience and a combination of thanatological data and environmental factors but is prone to errors. The lack of reliable methods for assessing PMI in bones and soft tissues necessitates a better understanding of bone decomposition. Several research groups have shown promise in PMI estimation in skeletal remains but lack valid data for forensic cases. Current methods are costly, time-consuming, and unreliable for PMIs over 5 years. Raman spectroscopy (RS) can potentially estimate PMI by studying chemical modifications in bones and teeth correlated with burial time. This review summarizes RS applications, highlighting its potential as an innovative, nondestructive, and fast technique for PMI estimation in forensic medicine.

However, the sluggish electronic conductivity still remains a challenge. Herein, bulk modification of Cu+ doping in porous TiNb2O7 microsphere is proposed via a simple one-step solvothermal method with subsequent calcination treatment. The results show that the electronic conductivity is improved effectively due to the reduced band gap after doping, while enhanced lithium-ion diffusion is achieved benefiting from the increased interplanar spacing. Therefore, the optimal sample of Cu0.06Ti0.94Nb2O7 exhibits a high reversible capacity of 244.4 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles, superior rate capability, and long-term cycling stability at 1000 mA g(-1) at room temperature. Particularly, it can also display good performance in a wide temperature range from 25 to -30 & DEG;C, including a reversible capacity of 76.6 mA h g(-1) at -20 & DEG;C after 200 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). Moreover, Cu0.06Ti0.94Nb2O7//LiFePO4 full cell can deliver a high reversible capacity of 177.5 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). The excellent electrochemical properties at both ambient and low-temperatures demonstrate the great potential of Cu+-doped TiNb2O7 in energy-storage applications.

While there has been great interest in species characteristics that promote invasiveness, still little is known about the characteristics that distinguish invasive from non-invasive insects. Using a database on the naturalised distributions of alien insects and expert opinions about their impacts, we identified the world's 100 worst invasive insect species.2. By comparing species characteristics reported in the literature using a meta-analysis, between the 100 worst invasive species and related non-invasive species, we found that invasive insects overall have more pathways of introduction, occur in more habitats, have higher fecundities, higher voltinism, more genes, shorted lifespans and faster development from egg to adult. Some of the differences in species characteristics related to propagule pressures, life-histories and biotic interactions, conditional on whether the non-invasive species compared is known to be naturalised somewhere, whether the invasive species is globally distributed, and the climatic region of the species.3. Synthesis and applications. We show for the first time, using a multi-species comparative approach, that invasive insects differ in several characteristics from related non-invasive insects. Our results show that invasive species, such as Spodoptera frugiperda, typically are habitat generalists with a high fecundity, a short lifespan and fast development, whereas the importance of female body size and number of enemies are context dependent. Our study can guide and improve existing screening tools for assessing the invasion potential of alien insects.

Hence, this study examined the effects of rational emotive behavioural and relaxation therapies on MA among deaf learners. The study adopted the quantitative quasi-experimental research design. A purposive sampling method was adopted to select three schools for the deaf in Oyo state. A random sampling procedure was employed to select 60 deaf learners who were assigned to two experimental groups and the control group. The Mathematics Anxiety Scale was used to screen participants, while a Mathematics Achievement Test was used for data collection. Data gathered were analysed using analysis of covariance and a descriptive chart. Findings revealed the efficacy of the two therapeutic interventions on the reduction of MA among the participants. The estimated mean difference between the treatments (rational emotive behavioural therapy = 5.537; relaxation therapy = 3.867) and control groups (1.670) showed higher potency of rational emotive behavioural therapy for reduction in MA among deaf learners than relaxation therapy. Based on the findings, it is important that mathematics teaching environment should be rich with tangible instructional materials that speak specifically to the emotion and cognitions of deaf learners.

Secondary aim was to assess the early wound healing index (EHI) at 2 weeks after surgery. BackgroundIt is hypothesized that healing after periodontal regeneration is dependent on preoperative soft tissue condition, and that local antibiotics may improve the site-specific inflammatory status at short time. MethodsSites associated with periodontal intrabony defects requiring regenerative surgery and showing bleeding on probing (BoP) were included. At T0, experimental sites were randomly treated with subgingival instrumentation with or without topic DOX application. After 2 weeks (T1), defects were approached by means of minimally invasive surgical technique. GCF was sampled at both T0 and T1 for inflammatory biomarker analysis. Two weeks after surgery, the EHI was evaluated (T2). ResultsForty-four patients were included. At T1, the number of BoP+ sites was statistically significantly less in the test group (27.3% vs. 72.7%; p < .01). The total amount of interleukin (IL)-1 & beta; (p < .001), matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP)-8 (p < .001), and MMP-9 (p = .010) in the GCF significantly decreased in the test group at T1, with relevant differences compared to controls. At T2, the EHI had an average value of 1.45 & PLUSMN; 0.86 in the test group while in the control, it was 2.31 & PLUSMN; 1.43 (p = .027). A statistically significantly positive correlation was observed between the amount of IL-1 & beta; and MMP-9 and EHI scores. ConclusionsWithin the limitations of this study, sites treated with DOX showed improved clinical and molecular inflammatory parameters before surgery, as well as soft tissue healing 2 weeks after surgery.

These applications rely on robust methods to manipulate gene function in hPSC models. This comprehensive review aims to both empower scientists approaching the field and update experienced stem cell biologists. We begin by highlighting challenges with manipulating gene expression in hPSCs and their differentiated derivatives, and relevant solutions (transfection, transduction, transposition, and genomic safe harbor editing). We then outline how to perform robust constitutive or inducible loss-, gain-, and change-of-function experiments in hPSCs models, both using historical methods (RNA interference, transgenesis, and homologous recombination) and modern programmable nucleases (particularly CRISPR/Cas9 and its derivatives, i.e., CRISPR interference, activation, base editing, and prime editing). We further describe extension of these approaches for arrayed or pooled functional studies, including emerging single-cell genomic methods, and the related design and analytical bioinformatic tools. Finally, we suggest some directions for future advancements in all of these areas. Mastering the combination of these transformative technologies will empower unprecedented advances in human biology and medicine.

Genetic testing and gene therapy in retinal diseases: Knowledge and perceptions of optometrists in Australia and New Zealand	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article; Early Access						eye care; gene therapy; genetic testing; inherited retinal diseases; ocular genetics; optometry; primary care; retinitis pigmentosa	CARE SERVICES; OPHTHALMOLOGY	With advances in gene-based therapies for heritable retinal diseases, primary eye care clinicians should be informed on ocular genetics topics. This cross-sectional survey evaluated knowledge, attitudes, and concerns regarding genetic testing and gene therapy for retinal diseases among optometrists in Australia and New Zealand. Survey data included practitioner background, attitudes and practices towards genetic testing for monogenic inherited retinal disease (IRDs) and age-related macular degeneration, and knowledge of ocular genetics and gene therapy. Responses were received from 516 optometrists between 1 April and 31 December 2022. Key perceived barriers to accessing genetic testing were lack of clarity on referral pathways (81%), cost (65%), and lack of treatment options if a genetic cause is identified (50%). Almost all respondents (98%) believed that ophthalmologists should initiate genetic testing for IRDs and fewer understood the role of genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists. This study found that optometrists in Australia and New Zealand have a high level of interest in ocular genetics topics. However, knowledge gaps include referral pathways and awareness of genetic testing and gene therapy outcomes. Addressing perceived barriers to access and promoting sharing of knowledge between interdisciplinary networks can set the foundation for genetic education agendas in primary eye care.

J	Cengiz, O; Manga, M				Cengiz, Orhan; Manga, Muge			Does economic globalization trigger de-industrialization in Western Balkan countries? Empirical evidence based on augmented mean group estimator	REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Early Access						economic globalization; deindustrialization; industrialization; manufacturing value-added; Western Balkans	EXPLAINING DEINDUSTRIALIZATION; PREMATURE DEINDUSTRIALIZATION; INDUSTRIALIZATION; TRADE; GROWTH	Integration into the global economy can cause shifts in industries and decrease the industrial sector's share. Deindustrialization, which refers to declining industry share, is commonly observed in developed countries. However, many developing countries have also experienced deindustrialization without attaining a high economic level in the era of globalization. Since transitioning to a market economy and integrating with the European Union (EU), deindustrialization has become a significant issue for Western Balkan countries. Thus, our paper analyzes the impact of economic globalization on the deindustrialization process in five Western Balkan countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia by using panel data spanning 2000-2019. Our study involved the creation of two models utilizing the augmented mean group (AMG) estimation method to ensure precise results. Our research shows that in model I, the economic globalization index, economic growth, capital investment, and the rule of law positively impact industry employment share. In model II, trade openness and economic growth positively affect manufacturing value-added; however, capital investment and the rule of law have a negative impact. Our findings indicate that economic globalization promotes industrialization in the Western Balkans instead of leading to deindustrialization. The panel causality results from Dumitrescu-Hurlin indicate that in model I, there is a one-way causal relationship going from economic globalization and capital investment to the share of industry employment. In model II, the causal relationship goes from economic growth and the rule of law to manufacturing value-added, from manufacturing value-added to trade openness and capital investment.

(Myrtales: Combretaceae) extracts in controlling Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						Combretum trifoliatum Vent.; fall armyworm; 5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromen-4-one; 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]; heptan-2-one; bioinsecticides; detoxification enzymes	FALL ARMYWORM; LEAF EXTRACTS; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; SULFURYL FLUORIDE; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; PLANT-EXTRACTS; CYPERMETHRIN; ANTIFEEDANT; TOXICITY; BIOACTIVITIES	BACKGROUND: The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is an important pest of agronomical crops. It is interesting to discover secondary metabolites in plants that are environmentally safer than synthetic pesticides. For this purpose, Combretum trifoliatum crude extract and its isolated compounds were investigated for their insecticidal activities against S. frugiperda. RESULTS: The median lethal dose (LD50) was evaluated in the second-instar larvae using the topical application method. The isolated compounds, apigenin and camphor, demonstrated a highly toxic effect on larvae at a lower LD50 dose than crude extract. Moreover, when the larvae were exposed to crude extract concentrations, the development to pupa and adult stages was reduced by more than 50%. The ovicidal toxicity was examined using a hand sprayer. The extract concentration 5, 10, and 20 mu g/egg significantly decreased the egg hatchability. In addition, crude extract showed a significant difference in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity while crude extract and camphor showed significant inhibitory effects on carboxylesterase (CE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities. CONCLUSION: The crude ethanol extract of Combretum trifoliatum was toxic to S. frugiperda in terms of larval mortality, negatively affecting biological parameters, and decreasing egg hatchability. Additionally, the activities of cholinergic and detoxifying enzymes were affected by crude extract and its isolated compounds. These results highlight that Combretum trifoliatum might be efficient as a bioinsecticide to control S. frugiperda. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

They play a crucial role in enhancing electronic reliability, healthcare, and defense security. However, traditional MAMs like ferrites, magnetic metals, and polymers possess certain limitations, including low impedance matching, narrow absorption bandwidth, poor chemical stability, and high filling ratio, which hinder their further development. To address the requirements of lightweight, wideband, and high-efficiency absorption, precise structural design has emerged as a captivating research focus. Additionally, comprehending the structure-property relationships between these unique microstructures and EM response and loss mechanisms still poses significant challenges. Herein, a comprehensive review of MAMs is presented with varied structural designs encompassing various scales, providing a detailed introduction of the relationship between various potential structural designs of MAMs and their corresponding EM characteristics and loss mechanisms. Moreover, EM theoretical calculation models, characterization, and analysis methods are discussed. Finally, the article proposes the challenges and prospects for the development of structural design EM wave absorbers.

Herein, we describe a further simplex case carrying a reported PRDX3 variant as well as two additional cases with novel variants. We report the first Brazilian patient with SCAR32, replicating the pathogenic status of a known variant. All presented cases from the Brazilian and Indian populations expand the phenotypic spectrum of the disease by displaying prominent neuroradiological findings. SCAR32, although rare, should be included in the differential diagnosis of sporadic or recessive childhood and adolescent-onset pure and complex cerebellar ataxia.

Genetic distance and bilateral foreign direct investment	WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article; Early Access						bilateral FDI; genetic distance; transaction costs	DETERMINANTS; UNCERTAINTY; DIFFUSION	This paper selects 141 countries from 2009 to 2020 to investigate the impact of genetic distance on bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI). Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we get the following conclusions. First, genetic distance has a significant negative impact on bilateral FDI by increasing transaction costs. This conclusion still holds after several robust checks. Second, genetic distance has different effects on bilateral FDI for different countries: (1) If at least one of the two countries is a low-income country, genetic distance will have a significant negative impact on their FDI, but no significant impact on both high-income countries; (2) if at least one of the two countries is not a member of the Belt and Road Initiative, genetic distance will have a significant negative impact, but no significant impact on both member countries; and (3) genetic distance has a significant negative impact only when both countries are World Trade Organization members. Third, further analysis shows that a smaller genetic distance has no significant effect on bilateral FDI, and only when the genetic distance is larger than the average would a significant negative impact exists.

J	Long, Y; Lin, SM; Lin, HT				Long, Ying; Lin, Shiming; Lin, Hua-Tay			Thermal stability of ReB<sub>2</sub>-type transition metal diborides	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						B content; thermal stability; transition metal diborides	HEXAGONAL OSB2; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SUPERHARD; 1ST-PRINCIPLES; BORIDES; HARDNESS	The thermal stability of metastable ReB2-type transition metal diborides (TMB2), which are considered as new type of superhard material, is of vital importance to obtain bulk samples. In the present work, thermal stability of four kinds of ReB2-type TMB2 powders, ReB2, OsB2, Os1-xRexB2, and Os1-xWxB2, were synthesized with varied transition metal (TM)-to-B molar ratio by mechanochemical methods and the subsequent annealing was compared. The as-synthesized powders were then consolidated using a pressureless sintering technique. The results showed that the B content required to obtain the pure hexagonal ReB2-type Os-1-(x)(TM)(x)B-2 phase varied, which indicated different thermal stabilities, such as OsB2 < Os0.1W0.1B2 < Os0.9Re0.1B2 < Os0.8W0.2B2 < ReB2 < Os0.6W0.4B2 and Os0.5W0.5B2. Among them, Os0.6W0.4B2 and Os0.5W0.5B2 were found to be relatively thermally stable and could be synthesized with a stoichiometric molar ratio of (Os + W):B = 1:2. It was also found that the thermal stability of TMB2 with a hexagonal ReB2 structure could be mainly governed by the length of lattice constant c. The results have guiding significance for the design and preparation of new type of TM borides. In addition, the hardness of TMB2 can be increased by tailoring the B content in the raw materials more precisely.

However, CBRAMs are prone to degenerate and fail during electrochemical metallization processes. To address this issue, herein we propose a self-repairability strategy for CBRAMs. Amorphous NbSe2 was designed as the resistive switching layer, with Cu and Au as the top and bottom electrodes, respectively. The NbSe2 CBRAMs demonstrate exceptional cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device uniformity, with forming-free and compliance current-free resistive switching characteristics, low-operation voltage, and competitive endurance and retention performance. Most importantly, the self-repairable behavior is discovered for the first time in CBRAM. The device after failure can recover its performance to the initially normal state by operating with a slightly large reset voltage. The existence of Cu conductive filament and excellent controllability of Cu migration in the NbSe2 switching layer has been revealed by a designed broken-down point approach, which is responsible for the self-repairable behavior of NbSe2 CBRAMs. Our self-repairable and high-uniform amorphous NbSe2 CBRAM may open the door to the development of memory and storage devices in the future.

However, the molecular characteristics underlying inflammation-related lung cancer remains unknown. In this work, the inflammation-related lung tumorigenesis mouse model was established by treated with B(a)P (1 mg/mouse, once a week for 4 weeks), followed by LPS (2.5 & mu;g/mouse, once every 3 weeks for five times), the mice were sacrificed 30 weeks after exposure. TMT-labeled quantitative proteomics and untargeted metabolomics were used to interrogate differentially expressed proteins and metabolites in different mouse cancer tissues, followed by integrated crosstalk between proteomics and metabolomics through Spearman's correlation analysis. The result showed that compared with the control group, 103 proteins and 37 metabolites in B(a)P/LPS group were identified as significantly altered. By searching KEGG pathway database, proteomics pathways such as Leishmaniasis, Asthma and Intestinal immune network for IgA production, metabolomics pathways such as Vascular smooth muscle contraction, Linoleic acid metabolism and cGMP-PKG signaling pathway were enriched. A total of 22 pathways were enriched after conjoint analysis of the proteomic and metabolomics, and purine metabolism pathway, the unique metabolism-related pathway, which included significantly altered protein (adenylate cyclase 4, ADCY4) and metabolites (L-Glutamine, guanosine monophosphate (GMP), adenosine and guanosine) was found. Results suggested purine metabolism may contribute to the inflammation-related lung tumorigenesis, which may provide novel clues for the therapeutic strategies of inflammation-related lung cancer.

J	Malhotra, A; Drexler, K; Hsu, MC; Tang, YL				Malhotra, Aniket; Drexler, Karen; Hsu, Michael; Tang, Yi-lang			Medication treatment for alcohol use disorder in special populations	AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS			English	Review; Early Access							EXTENDED-RELEASE NALTREXONE; HEPATIC SAFETY; OPIOID DEPENDENCE; GABAPENTIN; ACAMPROSATE; RISK; PHARMACOKINETICS; TOPIRAMATE; DRINKING; PHARMACOTHERAPIES	Background and ObjectivesAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant public health concern, with underutilized effective treatments, particularly in special populations. This article summarizes the current evidence and guidelines for treating AUD in special populations. MethodsThis article is a literature review that synthesizes the latest research on AUD treatment for special populations. We screened 242 articles and included 57 in our final review. ResultsThere are four food and Drug Administration-approved medications for AUD (MAUD): disulfiram, oral naltrexone, extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX), and acamprosate. Naltrexone and disulfiram have the potential to cause liver toxicity, and acamprosate should be avoided in patients with severe kidney disease. Psychosocial treatments should be considered first-line for pregnant and nursing patients. Naltrexone is contraindicated in patients on opioids, as it may precipitate acute withdrawal. For patients experiencing homelessness, nonabstinent treatment goals may be more practical, and XR-NTX should be considered to improve adherence. Limited evidence suggests medication can improve AUD treatment outcomes in adolescents and young adults. For patients with poor treatment response despite adequate medication adherence, switching to a different medication and augmentation with psychosocial treatments should be considered. Discussion and ConclusionsUnderstanding the unique considerations for special populations with AUD is crucial, and addressing their special needs may improve their treatment outcomes. Scientific SignificanceOur study significantly contributes to the existing literature by summarizing crucial information for the treatment of AUD in special populations, highlighting distinct challenges, and emphasizing tailored approaches to improve overall health and well-being.

Persistence of patient-detected breast cancer over time: 1990-2019	CANCER			English	Article; Early Access						breast cancer; cohort study; diagnosis; incidence; patient detected; race; stage; symptomatic	SERVICES TASK-FORCE; MAMMOGRAPHY; METAANALYSIS; SURVIVAL; INDIA	BackgroundThe continued presentation of patient-detected breast cancer (BC) and associated characteristics over time is understudied. MethodsIn a large institutional cohort of first primary stage 0-IV patients with BC in 1990-2019 (n = 15,827), diagnostic method (patient-detected [PtDBC] [n = 5844]; mammography-detected [MamDBC] [nondiagnostic] [n = 9248]; and physician-detected [PhysDBC] [n = 736]) and patient and tumor characteristics including age, race, TNM stage, and hormone-receptor status were reviewed. Pearson & chi;(2) tests for bivariate comparisons and logistic regression for patient detection-associated factors were used. ResultsIn a cohort from 1990 to 2019, the proportion aged 50-74 years (55%-63%; p < .001) and non-White race (9%-37%; p < .001) increased over time. Percentage PtDBC decreased over time but case numbers increased (1990-1999: 44% [n = 1399]; 2010-2019: 34% [n = 2349]; p < .001). Excluding stage 0, PtDBC declined from 47% to 41% over time (p < .001). In 2010-2019, 21% of cases were stage 0, 91% of which were mammography detected (n = 1439). Seventy percent of patient-detected cases were stage II-IV (stage II, 44%; stage III, 20%; stage IV, 6%; p < .001). In adjusted logistic regression, the odds of PtDBC decreased over time (2000-2009: odds ratio [OR], .65 [95% CI, .58-.72]; 2010-2019: OR, .54 [95% CI, .49-.60]), with age <40 years OR, 15.81, and Black and non-White other at 50% increased risk. ConclusionsThe relative proportion of PtDBC decreased to a constant 34%-40% of total cases after 1990-1999. PtDBC case numbers increased in subsequent years (2000-2019), and were consistently higher stage. Interval cancers, mammography-screening uptake, breast health awareness of age groups outside screening guidelines, and underserved socioeconomic groups may be related to the continued significant PtDBC incidence. Plain Language Summary After decades of mammography-screening availability, symptomatic patient-detected breast cancer declined over time from 44% to a persistent rate of 34% in our institutional cohort.The persistence of patient-detected breast cancer over time presents a difficult situation for patients and care givers without clear diagnosis pathways for younger and older women outside recommended screening guidelines, who often present with higher stage and more lethal characteristics.More timely diagnosis and treatment including breast health awareness, prompt presentation of breast problems, outreach to younger age and minority groups, and provision of specialized training and care delivery for symptomatic patient-detected breast cancer are needed.

Dietary tannins alter growth, behavior, and the gut microbiome of larval amphibians	INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						boldness; plant toxins; tadpole	LEAF-LITTER; DEFENDING PLANTS; TREE LEAVES; DECOMPOSITION; ASSIMILATION; TERRESTRIAL; PERSONALITY; STRATEGIES; REDUCTION; RUMINANTS	Research has shown that leached plant toxins negatively impact the growth and development of larval amphibians. However, tadpoles may encounter these same toxins in food material, and differential exposure routes and distribution of toxic chemicals can yield variable downstream effects on animals. To date, most research understanding the interactions between dietary plant toxins and herbivores has been conducted in terrestrial systems. Despite the abundance of plant toxins in food and water sources, the effects of dietary plant toxins on larval amphibians have not been studied, and tannins could negatively affect these species. Here, green frog tadpoles (Lithobates clamitans) were fed diets with or without 2% tannic acid to test how their growth, development, behavior, and gut microbiome respond to dietary tannins. At the end of the trial, we conducted a behavioral assay to measure tadpole activity and boldness and inventoried the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing. Dietary tannins significantly decreased body mass by 66% and length by 28%, without influencing tadpole developmental stage. We found significant differences in exploratory behavior and boldness during the first minute of our behavioral assay, demonstrating that tannins have the potential to influence behavior during novel or stressful events. Finally, tannins significantly sculpted the gut microbiome, with an increase in the measurement of Shannon entropy. We observed 7 microbial phyla and 153 microbial genera that exhibited significantly differential abundances differences between control and tannic acid-fed tadpoles. Collectively, our results demonstrate that dietary tannins have the potential to alter amphibian growth, behavior, and microbiome.

Quantitative increases of extracellular vesicles in prolonged cold storage of platelets increases the potential to enhance fibrin clot formation	TRANSFUSION MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates; cold storage; extracellular vesicles; platelet transfusion	ADDITIVE SOLUTION; REFRIGERATED PLATELETS; APHERESIS PLATELETS; HEMOSTATIC FUNCTION; QUALITY; MICROPARTICLES; 4-DEGREES-C; CLEARANCE; PAS	Background: Platelet derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) display a pro-coagulant phenotype and are generated throughout platelet concentrate (PC) storage. Cold storage (CS) of PCs is thought to provide a superior haemostatic advantage over room temperature (RT) storage and could prolong the storage time. However, the effect of storage conditions on EV generation and PC function is unknown. We investigated EV production under CS and RT conditions and assessed whether these EVs exhibited a more pro-coagulant phenotype in model experiments. Materials and Methods: Buffy-coat-derived PCs in a platelet additive solution (PAS) to plasma ratio of approximately 65:35 were stored at RT (22 +/- 2 degrees C) or CS (4 +/- 2 degrees C) for a prolonged storage duration of 20 days. Impedance aggregometry assessed platelet function. EVs were isolated throughout storage and quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis. EVs were applied to a coagulation assay to assess the impact on fibrin clot formation and lysis. Results: CS produced significantly larger EVs from day 4 onwards. EV concentration was significantly increased in CS compared to RT from day 15. EVs, regardless of storage, significantly reduced time to clot formation and maximum optical density measured compared to the no EV control. Clot formation was proportionate to the number of EV applied but was not statistically different across storage conditions when corrected for EV number. Conclusion: EVs in CS and RT units showed similar clot formation capacity. However, the higher number of larger EVs generated in CS compared to RT suggests PC units derived from CS conditions may overall exhibit a haemostatically superior capacity compared to RT storage.

Lessons Learned from an Academic Partnership to Review Pennsylvania Network for Student Assistance Services' Annual Survey	JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH			English	Review; Early Access						student assistance program; academic-public health partnership; data-driven decision-making	PUBLIC-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES	INTRODUCTION: Pennsylvania's Student Assistance Program (SAP) began in the mid-1980s to address student barriers to academic success. SAP teams, groups of trained school and community professionals, review referrals, and connect students to services. State leadership conducts an annual SAP team survey, but capacity to evaluate data and affect change is limited. In 2020, leadership partnered with [institution name] to collaboratively review the survey data. METHODS: Frequencies and percentages were calculated. Open responses were coded. Logistic regression models evaluated the association between SAP team size, team meeting frequency, and team maintenance. RESULTS: The 2019 to 2020 survey had 1003 respondents. Median number of SAP team members was 8 (range 1-21). The majority (54%) indicated their SAP team met once per week/cycle for 30 to 90+ minutes. Larger teams met more often. Annual team maintenance occurred for 38% of teams, and was more common for larger teams. SAP team members identified mental health (68%), trauma (44%), and parent engagement (36%) as top training needs. CONCLUSIONS: An academic partnership successfully provided the capacity to review SAP survey responses, and informed evidenced-based discussion of best practice guidelines and realignment of staff professional development opportunities.

J	Wang, M; Li, SW; Zhang, XX; Li, X; Cui, JQ				Wang, Meng; Li, Shiwei; Zhang, Xinxin; Li, Xin; Cui, Jingqiu			Association between hemoglobin glycation index and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	JOURNAL OF DIABETES INVESTIGATION			English	Article; Early Access						Hemoglobin glycation index; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Type 2 diabetes mellitus	INSULIN-RESISTANCE; BLOOD-GLUCOSE; RISK; NAFLD; STEATOHEPATITIS; PROGRESSION; PREVALENCE; STEATOSIS; POPULATION; FIBROSIS	Aims/IntroductionThe hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) represent the disparity between actual glycated hemoglobin measurements and predicted HbA1c. It serves as a proxy for the degree of non-enzymatic glycation of hemoglobin, which has been found to be positively correlated with diabetic comorbidities. In this study, we investigated the relationship between HGI and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), along with other relevant biological markers in patients with diabetes. Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study consisted of 3,191 adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We calculated the predicted glycated hemoglobin levels based on fasting blood glucose levels. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the correlation between the HGI and NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed using ultrasonography. ResultsAmong all participants, 1,784 (55.91%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. Participants with confirmed NAFLD showed elevated body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, liver enzyme, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein and uric acid levels compared with those without NAFLD. In the unadjusted model, participants in the last tertile of HGI were 1.40-fold more likely to develop NAFLD than those in the first tertile (95% confidence interval 1.18-1.66; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted model, those in the last tertile of HGI had a 39% increased risk of liver steatosis compared with confidence interval in the first tertile of HGI (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.74; P < 0.001). ConclusionsA higher HGI suggests an elevated risk of developing NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The oxygen reserve index (ORI) is a new parameter that can assess oxygenation through a relationship with arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2). The aim of this study was to examine whether the ORI provides a clinically relevant warning time for an impending SpO(2) (pulse oximetry hemoglobin saturation) reduction in neonates and small infants.Methods: ORI and SpO(2) were measured continuously in infants aged <2 years during general anesthesia. The warning time and sensitivity of different ORI alarms for detecting impending SpO(2) decrease were calculated. Subsequently, the agreement of the ORI and PaO2 with blood gas analyses was assessed.Results: The ORI of 100 small infants and neonates with a median age of 9 months (min-max, 0-21 months) and weight of 8.35 kg (min-max, 2-13 kg) were measured. For the ORI/PaO2 correlation, 54 blood gas analyses were performed. The warning time and sensitivity of the preset ORI alarm during the entire duration of anesthesia were 84 s (25th-75th percentile, 56-102 s) and 55% (95% CI 52%-58%), and those during anesthesia induction were 63 s (40-82 s) and 56% (44%-68%), respectively. The positive predictive value of the preset ORI alarm were 18% (95% CI 17%-20%; entire duration of anesthesia) and 27% (95% CI 21%-35%; during anesthesia induction). The agreement of PaO2 intervals with the ORI intervals was poor, with a kappa of 0.00 (95% CI = [-0.18; 0.18]). The weight (p = .0129) and height (p = .0376) of the infants and neonates were correlated to the correct classification of the PaO2 interval with the ORI interval.Conclusions: The ORI provided an early warning time for detecting an impending SpO(2) decrease in small infants and neonates in the defined interval in this study. However, the sensitivity of ORI to forewarn a SpO(2) decrease and the agreement of the ORI with PaO2 intervals in this real-life scenario were too poor to recommend the ORI as a useful early warning indicator for this age group.

In particular, individual VFET can be stacked on top of another and does not consume additional chip footprint beyond what is needed for a single device at the bottom, representing another dimension for high-density transistors. However, high-density VFETs with small pitch size are difficult to fabricate and is largely limited by the trade-offs between drain thickness and its conductivity. Here, a simple approach is reported to scale the drain to sub-10 nm. By combining 7 nm thick Au with monolayer graphene, the hybrid drain demonstrates metallic behavior with low sheet resistance of & AP;100 & omega; sq(-1). By van der Waals laminating the hybrid drain on top of 3 nm thick channel and scaling gate stack, the total VFET pitch size down to 20 nm and demonstrates a higher on-state current of 730 A cm(-2). Furthermore, three individual VFETs together are vertically stacked within a vertical distance of 59 nm, representing the record low pitch size for vertical transistors. The method pushes the scaling limit and pitch size limit of VFET, opening up a new pathway for high-density vertical transistors and integrated circuits.

These AI methods bring with them the potential to revolutionize diagnostic pipelines as well as treatment planning and overall patient care. Numerous peer-reviewed studies reporting remarkable performance across diverse tasks serve as a testimony to the potential of AI in the field. However, widespread adoption of these methods in clinical and pre-clinical settings still remains a challenge. In this review article, we present a detailed analysis of the major obstacles encountered during the development of effective models and their deployment in practice. We aim to provide readers with an overview of the latest developments, assist them with insights into identifying some specific challenges that may require resolution, and suggest recommendations and potential future research directions. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

J	Ay, R				Ay, Resul			The Problem of Early Islamic Diversity in Anatolia: Rethinking Dervish Piety Through Pantheistic Ideas	MUSLIM WORLD			English	Article						Islam in Anatolia; Sufism; Alevism; Dervish Piety; Folk piety in Anatolia		The Islamic diversity that developed parallel to the Islamization of Anatolia from roughly the 12(th) century onwards and was called dervish religiosity, is often defined by its inattentive and indifferent attitude toward Shari'a, although some of its other features are mentioned more or less. However, in this dervish-based religiosity, it draws attention that both the perception of Shari'a and some other religiosity practices are more related to the tawhid beliefs in pantheistic sense. This paper aims to analyze how both dervish religiosity and folk religiosity, which developed largely under its influence, are shaped through some mystical thoughts and spiritual experiences such as 'identification with God', 'immanence of God in man' and 'the human divinity'. The folk piety, which appears to be shaped within the framework of faith in saints, including high respect and various types of veneration that neglect the norms of Islamic worship, will be seen in relation to the pantheistic thoughts, as reflected in the understanding of seeing man as the qibla.

However, crucial open challenges still limit its applicability at large scale, such as the low coulombic efficiency, unstable electrodeposition, and dendrite propagation with severe safety concerns. One strategy to address these drawbacks is the rational design of innovative current collectors for the Li anode. Here, we report on a simple, low-cost, and easily scalable process based on Additive Manufacturing technology via extrusion 3D printing to produce Cu current collectors with different and tuneable patterned structures. The current collectors are characterized by means of X-ray diffractometry, electron microscopy, profilometry and galvanostatic cycling. We show that the three-dimensional network can significantly stabilize the electrodeposition of Li, thanks to an enhanced electroactive surface area that enables a better Li accommodation without uncontrollable dendrite growth. Contrary to the planar current collector, the Li anode supported by the 3D current collectors exhibits stable and low voltage hysteresis at different current densities and can run for at least 330 hours without short-circuiting. Moreover, the evaluation of Li@3DCu anode in a LiFePO4-based full cell by galvanostatic cycling reveals excellent rate performances, achieving specific capacity exceeding 100 mAh g(-1) at 1 C and coulombic efficiency higher than 99 %. These results show that the material extrusion 3D printing approach is a versatile strategy to develop new and safer anodes with a long lifespan and reduced amount of Li metal.

MethodOne-to-one, semistructured interviews with five therapists were conducted. Data collected from these interviews were subsequently analysed using the seven steps of interpretative phenomenological analysis. FindingsThe analysis revealed six superordinate themes: Enhance tutors' LGBTQ+ knowledge and cultural awareness; Provide students with adequate supervision; Teach a range of LGBTQ+ topics; Integrate LGBTQ cultural competence training throughout the curriculum; Invite LGBTQ+ specialists; and Signpost students to additional resources. ConclusionsParticipants felt unprepared by their entry-level counselling training to work with LGBTQ+ clients. The perceived lack of LGBTQ+ knowledge and understanding of their tutors was regarded as a contributing factor to the limited time and depth of LGBTQ cultural competence training received. Several suggestions to improve training in this area were offered. RecommendationsEntry-level counselling training courses should integrate LGBTQ cultural competence training throughout their curriculums in order to adequately prepare their trainees to work competently with LGBTQ+ clients. Additionally, it is important that counselling educators maintain their own LGBTQ+ knowledge, understanding and skills.

We identified individuals whose municipality of diagnosis differed from that of their residence. Flow maps, constructed using Tabwin 32 and ArcMap 9.2, allowed for the identification of the volume of traffic between the municipality of residence and that of initial care.Results There were 6775 confirmed VL cases. As a flow indicator, 178 counties had at least one resident diagnosed in another municipality in Ceara, with 2491 VL cases and an average trip of 79 km. The largest hub for receiving cases for diagnosis was the capital Fortaleza (1478 patients from 129 other municipalities), followed by Sobral, located in the northwestern region of Ceara (599 from 55 municipalities), and Barbalha, in the southern region (171 from 29 municipalities). In this southern region, 25 municipalities moved 55 people for treatment to Juazeiro do Norte and 11 municipalities moved 39 patients to Crato. A total of 255 patients with VL from 11 municipalities in other Brazilian states, mainly from the Northeast and North, were observed and notified in health services in Ceara.Conclusions The major centres of VL diagnosis outside residence were in the cities of Fortaleza, Sobral, Barbalha, Juazeiro do Norte and Crato. There was also an outflow of cases from other municipalities located in the northeastern and northern regions of Brazil. The flows were more intense during the first triennium of the analysis and milder from 2019 to 2021. Understanding the diagnostic flow of VL helps in decision making and the development of public policies to improve the lives of the population.

J	Chiang, CP; Li, JL; Chiou, TJ				Chiang, Chih-Pin; Li, Jia-Ling; Chiou, Tzyy-Jen			Dose-dependent long-distance movement of microRNA399 duplex regulates phosphate homeostasis in Arabidopsis	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						long-distance movement; microRNA399; PHO2; phosphate transport; small RNA duplex	PHO2; IDENTIFICATION; EVOLUTION; NETWORK; PHLOEM; SIRNA; ROOT	MicroRNA399 (miR399), a phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced long-distance signal, is first produced in shoots and moves to roots to suppress PHO2 encoding a ubiquitin conjugase, leading to enhanced Pi uptake and root-to-shoot translocation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying miR399 long-distance movement remains elusive.Hypocotyl grafting with various Arabidopsis mutants or transgenic lines expressing artificial miR399f was employed. The movement of miR399 across graft junction and the rootstock PHO2 transcript and scion Pi levels were analyzed to elucidate the potential factors involved.Our results showed that miR399f precursors are cell-autonomous and mature miR399f movement is independent of its biogenesis, sequence context, and length (21 or 22 nucleotides). Expressing viral silencing suppressor P19 in the root stele or blocking unloading in the root phloem pore pericycle (PPP) antagonized its silencing effect, suggesting that the miR399f/miR399f* duplex is a mobile entity unloaded through PPP. Notably, the scion miR399f level positively correlates with its amount translocated to rootstocks, implying dose-dependent movement.This study uncovers the molecular basis underlying the miR399-mediated long-distance silencing in coordinating shoot Pi demand with Pi acquisition and translocation activities in the roots.

To overcome current challenges, here, a sulfide-based composite electrode based on MoS2 and polyaniline (MoS2@PANI) is proposed as an ammonium-ion host. The optimized composite possesses specific capacitances above 450 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and 86.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in a three-electrode configuration. PANI not only contributes to the electrochemical performance but also plays a key role in defining the final MoS2 architecture. Symmetric supercapacitors assembled with such electrodes display energy densities above 60 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 725 W kg(-1). Compared with Li+ and K+ ions, the surface capacitive contribution in NH4+-based devices is lower at every scan rate, which points to an effective generation/breaking of H-bonds as the mechanism controlling the rate of NH4+ insertion/de-insertion. This result is supported by density functional theory calculations, which also show that sulfur vacancies effectively enhance the NH4+ adsorption energy and improve the electrical conductivity of the whole composite. Overall, this work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium-ion insertion electrodes.

J	Dalwadi, N; Deb, D; Ozana, S				Dalwadi, Nihal; Deb, Dipankar; Ozana, Stepan			Performance evaluation of RW-Quadrotor and Bi-Quadrotor for payload delivery	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Early Access						control engineering computing; intelligent sensors; Internet of Things; path planning	TRAJECTORY TRACKING; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; CONTROLLER; VEHICLE; GAINS; UAV	Payload delivery is one of the many Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications that save time, energy, and human resources. The present simulation study compares rotary-wing quadrotors (RW-Quadrotors) and tail-sitter biplane quadrotors (Bi-Quadrotors) under payload delivery conditions that help to choose the best UAV for the particular mission. A comparative study is performed based on (i) time taken to accomplish the given mission, (ii) trajectory tracking performance, (iii) motor speed throughout the entire flight envelope, and (iv) remains SoC (State of Charge) after the mission. Furthermore, a Backstepping Controller (BSC) and an Adaptive Backstepping Controller (ABSC) are developed for both UAVs to handle mass changes during flight while Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for the gain optimization. MATLAB Simulink-based numerical simulation reveals that the Bi-Quadrotor has a lower average rotor speed than the RW-Quadrotor. However, the Bi-Quadrotor's SoC after the mission is higher than the RW-Quadrotor, and it took less time to accomplish the mission. The ABSC designed for RW-Quadrotor and Bi-Quadrotor effectively handles mass change during the mission. However, the BSC controller increases energy consumption for the Bi-Quadrotor in the presence of wind gusts.

J	Day, J				Day, John			The intensification of parenting and generational fracturing of spontaneous physical activity from childhood play in the United Kingdom	SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH & ILLNESS			English	Article; Early Access						childhood; dialectic tensions; generations; parenting; physical activity; play	OUTDOOR PLAY; HEALTH; REPRESENTATIONS; MANAGEMENT; POSITION; CHILDREN; CONTEXT; GENDER	Despite an increased drive over the past two decades in Western societies to promote children's physically active play to improve their health, there are concerns that childhood has become less physically active. There are also fears that a previously naturally occurring aspect of childhood has become less authentically playful. Both trends highlight changes over time in the amount and type of play practiced by children and are often cited as consequences of generational shifts. Yet, research which analytically employs the concept of generation to connect changes to childhood with relevant social transformations is lacking. Inspired by Mannheim's conceptualisation of generations, this paper draws on life history interviews with 28 United Kingdom residents born between 1950 and 1994 to propose a fracturing of naturally occurring physical activity from childhood play. As shifts in childhood and parenting have become inextricably linked, this argument illustrates the impact of an intensification to parenting upon greater parental surveillance of increasingly organised forms of childhood physical activity at the expense of spontaneous play. Future physical activity policy should be sensitive to the social climate in which recommendations for children are made, as this places expectations upon parents due to how childhood is currently understood within neoliberal contexts.

This paper presents a highly efficient and compact deep learning (DL) model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various face recognition benchmarks. The developed DL model employs one- or few-shot learning to obtain effective feature embeddings and draws inspiration from FaceNet with significant refinements to achieve a memory size of only 3.5 MB-about 30 times smaller than FaceNet-while maintaining high accuracy and real-time performance. The study demonstrates the model's effectiveness through extensive experiments, which include testing on public datasets and the model's ability to recognize occluded faces in uncontrolled environments using grayscale input images. Compared to the state-of-the-art lightweight models, the proposed model requires fewer FLOPs (0.06G), has a smaller number of parameters (1.2 M), and occupies a smaller model size (3.5 MB) while achieving a competitive level of recognition accuracy and real-time performance. The results show that the model is well-suited for deployment in embedded domains, including live entrance security checks, driver authorization, and in-class attendance systems.

If you build it, they will come: Coastal amenities facilitate human engagement in marine protected areas	PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Article; Early Access						California; citizen science; community engagement; human dimensions; human use; marine protected areas; recreation; tourism	CULTURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CALIFORNIA; COMMUNITY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; RESERVES; DRIVERS; LESSONS; PROVIDE; IMPACT	Calls for using marine protected areas (MPAs) to achieve goals for nature and people are increasing globally. While the conservation and fisheries impacts of MPAs have been comparatively well-studied, impacts on other dimensions of human use have received less attention. Understanding how humans engage with MPAs and identifying traits of MPAs that promote engagement is critical to designing MPA networks that achieve multiple goals effectively, equitably and with minimal environmental impact.In this paper, we characterize human engagement in California's MPA network, the world's largest MPA network scientifically designed to function as a coherent network (124 MPAs spanning 16% of state waters and 1300 km of coastline) and identify traits associated with higher human engagement. We assemble and compare diverse indicators of human engagement that capture recreational, educational and scientific activities across California's MPAs.We find that human engagement is correlated with nearby population density and that site "charisma" can expand human engagement beyond what would be predicted based on population density alone. Charismatic MPAs tend to be located near tourist destinations, have long sandy beaches and be adjacent to state parks and associated amenities. In contrast, underutilized MPAs were often more remote and lacked both sandy beaches and parking lot access.Synthesis and applications: These results suggest that achieving MPA goals associated with human engagement can be promoted by developing land-based amenities that increase access to coastal MPAs or by locating new MPAs near existing amenities during the design phase. Alternatively, human engagement can be limited by locating MPAs in areas far from population centres, coastal amenities or sandy beaches. Furthermore, managers may want to prioritize monitoring, enforcement, education and outreach programmes in MPAs with traits that predict high human engagement. Understanding the extent to which human engagement impacts the conservation performance of MPAs is a critical next step to designing MPAs that minimize tradeoffs among potentially competing objectives.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

Hybrid neuroprostheses, i.e., the combination of robots and electrical stimulation, have emerged as an option to treat these impairments. MethodsTo give an overview of existing devices, their features, and how they are linked to clinical metrics, four different databases were systematically searched for studies on hybrid neuroprostheses for UL rehabilitation after stroke. The evidence on the efficacy of hybrid therapies was synthesized. ResultsSeventy-three studies were identified, introducing 32 hybrid systems. Among the most recent devices (n = 20), most actively reinforce movement (3 passively) and are typical exoskeletons (3 end-effectors). If classified according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, systems for proximal support are expected to affect body structures and functions, while the activity and participation level are targeted when applying Functional Electrical Stimulation distally plus the robotic component proximally. The meta-analysis reveals a significant positive effect on UL functions (p < 0.001), evident in a 7.8-point M-diff between groups in the Fugl-Meyer assessment. This positive effect remains at the 3-month follow-up (M-diff = 8.4, p < 0.001). ConclusionsHybrid neuroprostheses have a positive effect on UL recovery after stroke, with effects persisting at least three months after the intervention. Non-significant studies were those with the shortest intervention periods and the oldest patients. Improvements in UL functions are not only present in the subacute phase after stroke but also in long-term chronic stages. In addition to further technical development, more RCTs are needed to make assumptions about the determinants of successful therapy.

However, when conventional electrets come into direct contact with semiconductors, the energy level mismatch at the interface results in low memory speed and high energy consumption of electret devices due to both charge injection and storage being non-conducive. To address this, the n-type semiconductor N,N & PRIME;-dioctyl-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (C-8-PTCDI) is converted to C-8-PTCDI (D) via oxygen degradation. The resulting C-8-PTCDI (D) electrets, when charged using an electric field and/or light, retain the energy level of the n-type semiconductors to facilitate charge trapping. They also exhibit deeper trap energy levels and increased trap density, thereby enhancing the sheet charge density of C-8-PTCDI (D) electrets (7.47 x 10(12) cm(-2)). As a result, devices based on n-type electrets demonstrate lower operation voltage (2 V) of transistors, lower operation voltage (20 V) of memories, and lower energy consumption (3.5 fJ per spike) of artificial synapses compared to those without n-type electrets.

Initial Efficacy of a Fraction-Vocabulary Intervention for Students Experiencing Mathematics Difficulty in Grade 4	LEARNING DISABILITIES RESEARCH & PRACTICE			English	Article; Early Access							WHOLE-NUMBER; INSTRUCTION; KNOWLEDGE; CONNECTIONS; LANGUAGE; CHILDREN	This quasi-experimental study was designed to investigate the initial efficacy of a fraction-vocabulary intervention for Grade 4 students with mathematics difficulty (MD) and to explore its impact on relevant fraction competencies. Thirty-three students were assigned to either the intervention condition (n = 16) or a business-as-usual comparison condition (n = 17). The intervention occurred 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks, for a total of 11 sessions. Results indicated the main effect of the fraction-vocabulary intervention was significant for fraction-vocabulary posttest and one fraction competency-fraction arithmetic. That is, students with MD can successfully learn fraction vocabulary via a brief intervention, and improved fraction-vocabulary knowledge may positively affect their fraction competencies.

The Narrative Crisis Model, a multi-stage model from interpersonal distress to suicidal outcomes mediated by Suicide Crisis Syndrome severity, was assessed (H1). The present study tested whether (H2) parenthood moderates the indirect association between interpersonal distress and suicidality to reduce suicide risk. Psychiatric outpatients (N = 466) completed measures assessing the severity of interpersonal distress and Suicide Crisis Syndrome, as well as a clinical interview of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The sample was predominantly female (65.7%), with ages ranging from 18 to 84 years. Mediation was conducted on the total sample (H1) and a conditional process analysis compared parents (n = 170) and non-parents (H2). Suicide Crisis Syndrome severity mediated the relationship between interpersonal distress and suicidal outcomes. Parenthood moderated the indirect relationship between interpersonal distress and suicidal outcomes through Suicide Crisis Syndrome such that parents had a significantly higher suicide risk than non-parents (index = 0.058; 95% CI [0.005, 0.139]). In the context of an outpatient population, parents appear to be more at risk for developing a suicidal crisis and engaging in suicidal thoughts and behaviors than non-parents. Parenthood may act as a pile-up stressor for this population, outweighing the protective effects of having children. In this way, the Narrative Crisis Model is a theoretical model suitable for the examination of complex factors impacting risk for near-term suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Study designCadaveric anatomical study. AnimalsNine adult canine cadavers, free of disease affecting the thoracic cavity and lung parenchyma. MethodsMedian sternotomy and right and left lateral thoracotomies were performed to describe and image relevant variations in anatomy using accompanying photographs and thorough voice notes. Consideration for ALL removal via right thoracotomy at the fifth through seventh intercostal spaces and median sternotomy were documented and compared. ResultsThe median weight of the cadavers was 20.85 kg (6.9-45.5 kg). Variation in the configuration of venous drainage of the ALL was identified. The lateral vein varied in its location and was also observed to combine with the medial vein in one cadaver. The pulmonary ligament attached to the ALL in a caudally pointing apex on the dorsal process of the lobe. Medial and lateral extensions of the ALL parenchyma were found. The ALL was most easily accessed by a right lateral thoracotomy at the sixth intercostal space. Although not optimal, removal of this lung lobe via median sternotomy was feasible. ConclusionSignificant variations were found in the blood supply to the ALL. A right lateral thoracotomy at the sixth intercostal space was preferred for a surgical approach to the ALL. Clinical significanceSurgeons should be aware of several anatomical particularities including the venous drainage, ligamentous attachments, and parenchymal extensions of the ALL.	[Mather, Alastair J.

Previous reports have suggested that specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) gene affect therapeutic efficacy; however, whether the FPGS SNPs affect renal function is unclear. Identifying SNPs related to renal damage during PEM administration may help predict the decrease in renal function caused by PEM. MethodsWe retrospectively examined age, sex, body weight, total administered PEM, combined platinum, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and serum creatinine (SCr) levels before and after PEM administration in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and searched for the alleles of FPGS SNPs (rs1544105 and rs10106) using DNA extracted from whole blood samples of patients. ResultsRenal function decreased after PEM administration in 26 cases overall. The SCr and eGFR indices showed decreased renal function irrespective of concomitant cisplatin use. Based on promoter activity and miRNA binding predictions, rs1544105-C and rs10106-T were hypothesized to increase FPGS expression. Single SNP analyses showed no significant differences in renal function between groups with and without each SNP. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the most significant factors for decreased renal function were sex on SCr and the number of SNPs on eGFR. In subgroup analyses, the patients with rs10106-T showed a decline in renal function in the older group. ConclusionsThe number of FPGS SNPs may contribute to PEM-induced renal impairment. Detecting FPGS SNPs may help predict PEM-induced renal damage.

Evidence to initiate restoration in Central Sonora, Mexico	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						desertification; restoration; seedling emergence; seedling survival; Sonoran Desert	GROWTH-PROMOTING MICROORGANISMS; SOIL; DESERT; FOREST; REGENERATION; GERMINATION; CONVERSION; SURVIVAL; PASTURE; CACTUS	Buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) has been introduced in many localities of northwestern Mexico for cattle grazing. Recent studies have documented how the conversion of natural vegetation to buffelgrass pastures affects several ecological processes that result in high levels of desertification and the subsequent abandonment of lands. However, no previous study has documented successful restoration in these habitats. In this paper we report the results of several experiments focused on the restoration of these areas using native legume species of the region. We selected a degraded buffelgrass pasture considered unproductive by local ranchers in central Sonora. We carried out experiments to evaluate seed removal, seedling emergence, and seedling establishment of native legumes species (Prosopis glandulosa, Parkinsonia microphylla and P. praecox). Our results showed that P. microphylla had greater emergence (10%) than the other two species despite the high seed removal recorded. In addition, P. microphylla was the species with the highest survival (1.4%). Thus, our results show that ecological recovery using native species is possible in desertified buffelgrass pastures. Considering the ecological benefits of P. microphylla in the Sonoran Desert (i.e., nurse plant, positive associations, plant-growth promoting), this species could be considered highly valuable in restoration procedures.

Although most patients are cured, approximately 10%-15% of patients experience a relapse or have resistant disease. Furthermore, there are no definitive molecular predictors for early identification of patients at high risk of treatment failure to first line therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the deep learning-based classifier model of medical image classification to predict clinical outcome that may help in appropriate therapeutic decisions.MethodsEighty-three FFPE biopsy specimens from patients with Hodgkin's disease were stratified according to the patient's qPET scores, stained with picrosirius red dye and digitalized by whole slide image scanning. The resulting whole slide images were cut into tiles and annotated by two classes based on the collagen fibers' degree of coloring with picrosirius red. The neural network (YOLOv4) was then trained with the annotated data. Training was performed with 30 cases. Prognostic power of the weakly stained picrosirius red fibers was evaluated with 53 cases. The same neural network was trained with MMP9 stained tissue slides from the same cases and the quantification results were compared with the variant from the picrosirius red cases.ResultsThere was a weak monotonically increasing relationship by parametric ANOVA between the qPET groups and the percentages of weakly stained fibers (p = .0185). The qPET-positive cases showed an average of 18% of weakly stained fibers, and the qPET-negative cases 10%-14%. Detection performance showed an AUC of 0.79.ConclusionsPicrosirius red shows distinct associations as a prognostic metric candidate of disease progression in Hodgkin's disease cases using whole slide images but not sufficiently as a prognostic device.

The secondary objective was to assess the influence of fetal gender on the generated reference curves.Methods In a cross-sectional prospective study 453 low-risk singleton pregnancies were evaluated at a gestational age interval between 18 and 34 weeks. The width of CSP were measured on ultrasound images using a standardized technique and their changes were evaluated by quantile regression as a function of gestational age (GA) interval or head circumference (HC). Differences between sex were evaluated.Results The measurement of CSP significantly increased with gestation and HC. Linear models better described the changes of CSP with GA and HC. The fits of CSP width with GA and HC were not significantly different. Male fetuses showed significantly higher CSP width when compared to female fetuses (u = 2.973; p = 0.005).Conclusions We generated prospective nomograms of fetal CSP development using quantile regression and following a strict standardized methodology. These new charts may be useful to better identify abnormal cases at higher risk of associated anomalies. Further our findings underline the potential effect of gender in developing fetal brain.

Low molecular weight heparin sodium (LMWH) reduced the incidence of pre-eclampsia, may be an effective treatment of pre-eclampsia. But the underlying mechanism of LMWH is unknown. To improve the molecular utilization rate, chitosan-LMWH nanoparticles (CHsN) are purchased for the study. The prague of pregnancy Sprague-Dawley rats are injected with nitroso l-arginine methyl ester to construct a pre-eclampsia model. Trichotrophoblast cells HTR-8/SVneo are cultured under Hypoxia/reoxygenation injury (H/R) simulation conditions to construct the cell model. CHsN ameliorates the integrity of fetal membrane tissue. Administration of CHsN results in decreased urine protein and HB-EGF levels, accompanied by increased numbers of pups and placenta. Treatment with CHsN increases the proportion of Treg cells and decreases the proportion of Th17 cells. After treatment with CHsN, the levels of LPS, TNF-& alpha;, rank1, slp1, Foxo, NF-& kappa;B, and HIF-1 & alpha; are down-regulated, while the levels of IL-2, Foxp3, and TGF & beta;1 are up-regulated. CRM197 reverses the effect of CHsN. The CHsN improves H/R-induced HTR-8/SVneo cells apoptosis through HB-EGF and affected CD4+T cell differentiation. CHsN ameliorates pre-eclampsia by regulating Treg/Th17 immune balance and inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface through HB-EGF. This provides a theoretical reference for relieving pre-eclampsia by CHsN.

Outside of clinical trials, BM evaluations are only performed in similar to 50% of patients during follow-up, pinpointing a clinical need for response endpoints that do not necessitate BM assessments. We define and validate a new response type termed "peripheral blood complete remission" (PB-CR) that can be determined from the differential blood count and clinical parameters without necessitating a BM assessment. We compared the predictive value of PB-CR with morphologic CR/CRi in 1441 non-selected, consecutive patients diagnosed with MDS (n = 522; 36.2%), CMML (n = 132; 9.2%), or AML (n = 787; 54.6%), included within the Austrian Myeloid Registry (aMYELOIDr; NCT04438889). Time-to-event analyses were adjusted for 17 covariates remaining in the final Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model. DeepSurv, a CPH neural network model, and permutation-based feature importance were used to validate results. 1441 patients were included. Adjusted median overall survival for patients achieving PB-CR was 22.8 months (95%CI 18.9-26.2) versus 10.4 months (95%CI 9.7-11.2) for those who did not; HR = 0.366 (95%CI 0.303-0.441; p <.0001). Among patients achieving CR, those additionally achieving PB-CR had a median adjusted OS of 32.6 months (95%CI 26.2-49.2) versus 21.7 months (95%CI 16.9-27.7; HR = 0.400 [95%CI 0.190-0.844; p =.0161]) for those who did not. Our deep neural network analysis-based findings from a large, prospective cohort study indicate that BM evaluations solely for the purpose of identifying CR/CRi can be omitted.

We suggest that welfare states varied in their religious foundations during the transition from religious-based solidarity to modern state-based solidarity and formulate a novel analytical framework to hypothesize effects across individuals and welfare regime types. Using eight waves of the European Social Survey (2002-16), we find that religious effects are strongest in welfare states with the most religious foundations, the Southern European welfare states, and weak in the universalist welfare states, which lacked historical state-church tensions. Other welfare types show a mix of religious effects, with some challenging expectations. Furthermore, Christian majority membership is often associated with heightened anti-immigrant attitudes, most consistently in contrast to the non-Christian minority. For welfare-based forms of inclusion, we find consistent institutional trust effects and two competing logics for secular boundaries: a propensity for welfare chauvinism and a culture of inclusion.

This study was designed to evaluate the reproductive and neurobehavioral effects of dinotefuran exposure in mice.Methods: Dinotefuran was given in the diet to provide levels of 0% (control), 0.015%, 0.03%, and 0.06% from 5 weeks of age of the F-0 generation to 11 weeks of age of the F-1 generation in mice. Selected reproductive and neurobehavioral parameters were measured.Results: Movement time increased with a significant dose-related trend, and the related variables of rearing time decreased in significant dose-related trends in adult males in the F-0 generation. Litter size and weight increased in significant dose-related trends, and sex ratio decreased in a significant dose-related trend. The average body weight of offspring increased in a significant dose-related trend on postnatal day (PND) 21 in both sexes. In the olfactory orientation on PND 14 in female offspring, the time required lengthened in a significant dose-related trend. In male offspring, total distance and the average speed decreased in significant dose-related trends, and the average time of rearing, number of defecations, and frequencies of mice with urination increased in a significant dose-related trend. In female offspring, the related variables of rearing increased in significant dose-related trends. In spontaneous behavior of males, the parallel lines during the control and treatment groups indicated a significant distance in the number of horizontal activities.Conclusions: The dose levels of dinotefuran in the present study produced several adverse effects on reproductive and neurobehavioral parameters in mice.

Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data showed that all members of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family (hexamers involved in DNA replication: MCM2-MCM7) were upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues. High expression of MCM4 (P = 0.0032), MCM5 (P = 0.0032), and MCM7 (P = 0.0110) significantly predicted 5-year survival rates in patients with LUAD. Simurosertib (TAK-931) significantly suppressed the proliferation of LUAD cells by inhibiting cell division cycle 7-mediated MCM2 phosphorylation. This finding suggested that MCM2 might be a therapeutic target for LUAD. Moreover, analysis of the epigenetic regulation of MCM2 showed that miR-139-3p, miR-378a-5p, and miR-2110 modulated MCM2 expression in LUAD cells. In patients with LUAD, understanding the role of these miRNAs may improve prognoses.

We provide evidence that, as evaluated by quarterly earnings conference call transcripts of companies with analysts that focus on political risk or uncertainty, political risk at the firm level is inversely related to the quality of accounting information. This effect is more likely to happen to firms with a higher agency problem, faster growth, and greater reliance on outside finance. The results persist after controlling macroeconomic variables. Our findings are also robust to alternative financial reporting quality criteria and endogeneity tests, and are economically significant.

Modeling the influence of threat perceptions on hurricane evacuation in a dual-threat environment	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19; hurricane evacuation; hurricane hazard intrusiveness; optimistic bias; risk perception	DECISION-MAKING; UNREALISTIC OPTIMISM; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; HOUSEHOLD ADJUSTMENT; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; INFORMATION-SOURCES; EARTHQUAKE HAZARD; RISK PERCEPTION; FIT INDEXES; RESPONSES	This study investigates how different risk predictors influenced households' evacuation decisions during a dual-threat event (Hurricane Laura and COVID-19 pandemic). The Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) literature indicates that perceived threat variables are the most influential variables that drive evacuation decisions. This study applies the PADM to investigate a dual-threat disaster that has conflicting protective action recommendations. Given the novelty, scale, span, impact, and messaging around COVID-19, it is crucial to see how hurricanes along the Gulf Coast-a hazard addressed seasonally by residents with mostly consistent protective action messaging-produce different reactions in residents in this pandemic context. Household survey data were collected during early 2021 using a disproportionate stratified sampling procedure to include households located in mandatory and voluntary evacuation areas across the coastal counties in Texas and parishes in Louisiana that were affected by Hurricane Laura. Structural equation modeling was used to identify the relationships between perceived threats and evacuation decisions. The findings suggest affective risk perceptions strongly affected cognitive risk perceptions (CRPs). Notably, hurricane and COVID-19 CRPs are significant predictors of hurricane evacuation decisions in different ways. Hurricane CRPs encourage evacuation, but COVID-19 CRPs hinder evacuation decisions.

However, most existing DNA-based probes rely on fluorescence as the signal output, which can be problematic due to issues like autofluorescence and scattering when applied in complex biological materials such as living cells or tissues. Herein, we report the development of bioluminescent nucleic acid (bioLUNA) sensors that offer laser excitation-independent and ratiometric imaging of the target in vivo. The system is based on computational modelling and mutagenesis investigations of a genetic fusion between circular permutated Nano-luciferase (NLuc) and HaloTag, enabling the conjugation of the protein with a DNAzyme. In the presence of Zn2+, the DNAzyme sensor releases the fluorophore-labelled strand, leading to a reduction in bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the luciferase and fluorophore. Consequently, this process induces ratiometric changes in the bioluminescent signal. We demonstrated that this bioLUNA sensor enabled imaging of both exogenous Zn2+ in vivo and endogenous Zn2+ efflux in normal epithelial prostate and prostate tumors. This work expands the DNAzyme sensors to using bioluminescence and thus has enriched the toolbox of nucleic acid sensors for a broad range of biomedical applications.

J	Arab, M; Danesh, S				Arab, Maliheh; Danesh, Shahnaz			A sustainable system for decontamination of cephalexin antibiotic using electrocoagulation technology and response surface methodology	REMEDIATION-THE JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COSTS TECHNOLOGIES & TECHNIQUES			English	Article; Early Access							WASTE-WATER; CURRENT-DENSITY; REMOVAL; EFFICIENCY; METRONIDAZOLE	The emergence of synthetic micropollutants in wastewater due to domestic and industrial use has presented new challenges for treatment processes. Among these pollutants, pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are considered emerging contaminants due to their potential to enter drinking water sources. Antibiotics, in particular, are of significant concern due to their high consumption in veterinary and human applications. In this study, the electrocoagulation (EC) process is used as an efficient technique for the removal of cephalexin (CFX) from pharmaceutical wastewater. The study aims to explore the ability of the EC process to remove CFX and optimize its performance using the response surface method based on Central Composite Design (RSM-CCD). The effects of initial CFX concentration, electrolysis time, initial pH, and electrode type (non-insulated and insulated) were considered in the optimization process. This research is distinct as it examines the influence of key factors on the elimination of CFX. The results showed that electrolysis time had the most significant effect on CFX removal using the EC process. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to evaluate the importance of independent variables and their interaction. The optimal operating conditions for maximum removal efficiency (86.53%) were an initial cephalexin concentration, reaction time, and initial pH of 34 mg/L, 34.35 min, and 6.5, respectively, using an insulated electrode. Under these optimal conditions, predicted cephalexin removal was 93.54%. These findings demonstrate that RSM-CCD is a useful tool for optimizing electrochemical removal processes for micropollutants such as CFX from wastewater streams. The study highlights the importance of considering electrode type in optimizing EC processes for micropollutant removal from wastewater.

In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, this work investigates the relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, the polycrystalline material is demonstrated to develop charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography (APT) measurements, an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries are found. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization-driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

However, poor flexibility and low heat resistance limited obviously the application of PBZ. Herein, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet and its amino-rich derivatives (fGO-g-SiO2) with multi-scale surfaces were designed, synthesized and incorporated into main-chain PBZ through in-situ polymerization to fabricate PBZ composites. The morphology, mechanical properties, and thermal stability of the composites were systematically investigated using x-ray diffraction (XRD), contact angle tests, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), tensile and impact tests, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). FTIR and XRD analyses confirmed the multi-scale surfaces of GO derivatives and ordered structures, respectively. The size of the in-situ grown SiO2 and the thickness of GO coated on PBZ were estimated as 6.5 and 19.07 nm, respectively. The contact angle test revealed that fGO-g-SiO2 and BZ had the closest solid surface energy of 32.002 and 43.519 mN/m, respectively, among the components of the composites. The impact and tensile evaluation revealed the highest impact, tensile strength and Young's modulus of 16.75 kJ/m(2), 107.24 MPa and 3.17 GPa, respectively for 1.2% fGO-g-SiO2/PBZ composite. The modified Halpin-Tsai equation was also utilized to develop a predictive function for the tensile strength. FESEM of fGO-g-SiO2/PBZ composites indicated that the multi-scale effect and amination effectively improved the restriction of GO derivatives on crack propagation in PBZ composites and played a more significant role in crack deflection and bridging. In addition, the highest thermal decomposition activation energy of 166.94 kJ/mol was achieved for 1.2% fGO-g-SiO2/PBZ composite. Highlights circle Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were incorporated into main-chain polybenzoxazine (PBZ) to improve its mechanical properties and heat resistance. circle GO with multi-scale structure and amino-rich interface were designed, synthesized to improve the interface interactions with PBZ matrix. circle The GO with multi-scale structure and amino-rich interface showed excellent similarity in the term of solid surface energy with benzoxazine oligomers. circle The morphology, mechanical and thermal stability of resulting PBZ composites was systematically investigated by using experimental and mathematical model to elucidate the relationships between the structure and properties. circle The composites exhibited excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and it is expected to be used as advanced engineering material in demanding environments.

They play a crucial role in modern software development and maintenance. As such, much research effort has been invested in understanding the quality and evolution of build systems, including Apache ANT, Apache Maven, and Make-based ones. However, the quality and evolution of build systems for mobile apps, such as on the Android platform, have not as yet been investigated in detail. Mobile app development, and the Android development context in particular, impose unique constrains, such as different device conditions and capabilities. It presents unique challenges, such as frequently upgraded Android frameworks, which those who implement and maintain build systems must tackle. In this paper, we present an exploratory empirical study of the build systems of 5222 Android projects to better understand their quality and evolution. We (a) study the build technology choices that Android developers make (Gradle being recommended and the most popular choice), (b) explore the sustainability of the official Gradle build system (parts of build files are updated more frequent that others and the update of the special Gradle plugin would induce unrecommended configurations), and (c) analyze the quality of Gradle scripts for Android apps-more than a half of the open-source Android apps cannot be successfully built due to five common root causes.

To address this, we developed a software package, called RatVocalTracker1.0 (RVT1.0), to quantify VF motion and tested it on rats with iatrogenic unilateral vocal fold paralysis (VFP).Methods: A deep neural network was trained to identify the positions of the VFs and arytenoid cartilages (ACs) in trans -oral laryngoscope videos of the rat glottis. Software was developed to estimate glottic midline, VF displacement, VF velocity, and AC angle. The software was applied to laryngoscope videos of adult rats before and after right recurrent and superior laryngeal nerve transection (N = 15; 6M, 9F). All software calculated metrics were compared before and after injury and validated against manually calculated metrics.Results: RVT1.0 accurately tracked and quantified VF displacement, VF velocity, and AC angle. Significant differences were found before and after surgery for all RVT1.0 calculated metrics. There was strong agreement between programmatically and manually calculated measures. Automated analysis was also more efficient than nearly all manual methods.Conclusion: This approach provides fast, accurate assessment of VF motion in rats with minimal labor and allows for quantitative comparison of lateral differences in movement. Through this novel analysis method, we can differentiate healthy movement from unilateral VFP. RVT1.0 is open-source and will be a valuable tool for researchers using the rat model for laryn-gology research.

The model of sustainable mental health (SMH) was recently introduced to delineate how interventions can improve mental health by targeting barriers and resources of adaptation to life stressors, improving the ability to adapt and thereby reducing mental illness and improving mental well-being. The aim of the current study is to empirically validate the conceptual model of SMH as well as the assumed indirect role of ability to adapt. MethodsThis study used an existing dataset of the general population with self-reported reduced well-being due to the corona crisis (n = 849, mean age 53 years, SD = 15). Measurements of mental illness (depression and anxiety), mental well-being, ability to adapt, a specific barrier for adaptation (i.e., repetitive negative thinking), and a specific resource for adaptation (i.e., positive reframing) were included. Structural equation modeling was used to assess both the structural validity of the model and the indirect effect of ability to adapt. ResultsAn acceptable to good fit was found for the model of SMH and all paths between the proposed elements of the model were significant and in the hypothesized direction. Ability to adapt served as an indirect pathway trough which repetitive negative thinking (B = 0.149, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.016-0.028) and positive reframing (B = 0.163, 95% CI = 0.065-0.123) were linked with mental illness and mental well-being. ConclusionThe current study provides the first empirical support of the internal validity of the model of SMH in a sample of the general population with reduced well-being, suggesting that barriers and resources to adaptation have an effect on mental illness and mental well-being through the ability to adapt. The model of SMH may therefore be a good model to use in research and clinical practice for developing, implementing, and evaluating a balanced treatment approach targeting both barriers and resources for adaptation.

Comparison of solvent systems on extraction, quality characteristics, and volatile compounds of palm kernel oil	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						extraction; fatty acid composition; palm kernel oil; quality characteristics; volatile compounds	LIPID EXTRACTION; AROMA	Hexane (HEX) and dichloromethane (DCM) have been used to extract oils from various sources due to their expansive solubility and low volatility that ease removal at low temperatures. However, environmental and health concerns make them undesirable solvents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extraction efficiency and physicochemical characteristics of palm kernel oil (PKO) extracted with the addition of acetone in HEX-acetone (1:1, vol/vol) and DCM-acetone (1:1, vol/vol) mixtures as an alternative to DCM and HEX alone. PKO extracted with co-solvent systems had better quality characteristics compared with single solvent extracts. The oil recovered, free fatty acid content, peroxide value and other quality characteristics, and thermal properties were within the range for PKO, and similar oils as stipulated in standards. Monounsaturated fatty acid content in PKO was up to 70% of which lauric acid was the most abundant (48%-52%). A total of 50 volatile compounds were identified by GC-MS in all the extracts including amide (1), alcohol (1), aldehydes (2), ketones (3), acids (6), esters (6) and hydrocarbons (31) with higher numbers of volatiles in the HEX extracts compared to the DCM extracts. Dodecanoic acid, hexanal, and 2-undecanone were the most abundant acid, aldehyde, and ketone, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) differentiated the volatiles identified on the polar and non-polar columns with 88.2% and 8.8%, and 67.3% and 19.6% of the variation accounted for by PC1 and PC2, respectively, with several common volatile components forming a cluster from all the solvents used.

How safe is the treatment of pregnant women with fear of childbirth using eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy? Obstetric outcomes of a multi-center randomized controlled trial	ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article; Early Access						childbirth; childbirth experience; EMDR; eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy; fear of childbirth; pregnancy; tocophobia	DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE; PSYCHO-EDUCATION INTERVENTION; DEPRESSION	IntroductionPregnant women with fear of childbirth display an elevated risk of a negative delivery experience, birth-related post-traumatic stress disorder, and adverse perinatal outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and postpartum depression. One of the therapies used to treat fear of childbirth is eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. The purpose of the present study was to determine the obstetric safety and effectiveness of EMDR therapy applied to pregnant women with fear of childbirth. Material and methodsA randomized controlled trial (the OptiMUM-study) was conducted in two teaching hospitals and five community midwifery practices in the Netherlands (, NTR5122). Pregnant women (n = 141) with a gestational age between 8 and 20 weeks and suffering from fear of childbirth (i.e. sum score on the Wijma Delivery Expectations Questionnaire & GE;85) were randomly allocated to either EMDR therapy (n = 70) or care-as-usual (CAU) (n = 71). Outcomes were maternal and neonatal outcomes and patient satisfaction with pregnancy and childbirth. ResultsA high percentage of cesarean sections (37.2%) were performed, which did not differ between groups. However, women in the EMDR therapy group proved seven times less likely to request an induction of labor without medical indication than women in the CAU group. There were no other significant differences between the groups in maternal or neonatal outcomes, satisfaction, or childbirth experience. ConclusionsEMDR therapy during pregnancy does not adversely affect pregnancy or the fetus. Therefore, therapists should not be reluctant to treat pregnant women with fear of childbirth using EMDR therapy.	[Baas, Melanie A.

In particular, we designed a priori attention mechanism in the neural network framework for optimal decomposition. We show that a patient-specific prior cross-attention (PCAT) mechanism can boost the performance of kV image decomposition. We demonstrate its use in paraspinal SBRT motion tracking with online kV imaging. MethodsOnline 2D kV projections were acquired during paraspinal SBRT for patient motion monitoring. The patient-specific prior images were generated by randomly shifting and rotating spine-only DRR created from the setup CBCT, simulating potential motions. The latent features of the prior images were incorporated into the PCAT using multi-head cross attention. The neural network aimed to learn to selectively amplify the transmission of the projection image features that correlate with features of the priori. The PCAT network structure consisted of (1) a dual-branch generator that separates the spine and soft tissue component of the kV projection image and (2) a dual-function discriminator (DFD) that provides the realness score of the predicted images. For supervision, we used a loss combining mean absolute error loss, discriminator loss, perceptual loss, total variation, and mean squared error loss for soft tissues. The proposed PCAT approach was benchmarked against previous work using the ResNet generative adversarial network (ResNetGAN) without prior information. ResultsThe trained PCAT had improved performance in effectively retaining and preserving the spine structure and texture information while suppressing the soft tissues from the kV projection images. The decomposed spine-only x-ray images had the submillimeter matching accuracy at all beam angles. The decomposed spine-only x-ray significantly reduced the maximum errors to 0.44 mm (<2 pixels) in comparison to 0.92 mm (& SIM;4 pixels) of ResNetGAN. The PCAT decomposed spine images also had higher PSNR and SSIM (p-value < 0.001). ConclusionThe PCAT selectively learned the important latent features by incorporating the patient-specific prior knowledge into the deep learning algorithm, significantly improving the robustness of the kV projection image decomposition, and leading to improved motion tracking accuracy in paraspinal SBRT.

Although diabetes diagnosis via exhaled breath has great potential for early diagnosis, research on such diagnosis is restricted to disease detection, requiring in-depth examination to diagnose and classify diseases and their complications. This study demonstrates the use of an artificial neural processing-based bioelectronic nose to accurately diagnose diabetes and classify diabetic types (type I and II) and their complications, such as heart disease. Specifically, an M13 phage-based electronic nose (e-nose) is used to explore the features of subjects with diabetes at various levels of cellular and organismal organization (cells, liver organoids, and mice). Exhaled breath samples are collected during culturing and exposed to the phage-based e-nose. Compared with cells, liver organoids cultured under conditions mimicking a diabetic environment display properties that closely resemble the characteristics of diabetic mice. Using neural pattern separation, the M13 phage-based e-nose achieves a classification success rate of over 86% for four conditions in mice, namely, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and cardiomyopathy.

These limitations can be attributed to the sluggish and uneven Li+ migration towards Li metal surface. Here, we report olefin-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electronegative channels for facilitating selective Li+ transport. The triazine rings and fluorinated groups of the COFs are introduced as electron-rich sites capable of enhancing salt dissociation and guiding uniform Li+ flux within the channels, resulting in a high Li+ transference number (0.85) and high ionic conductivity (1.78 mS cm(-1)). The COFs are mixed with a polymeric binder to form mixed matrix membranes. These membranes enable reliable Li plating/stripping cyclability over 700 h in Li/Li symmetric cells and stable capacity retention in Li/LiFePO4 cells, demonstrating its potential as a viable cationic highway for accelerating Li+ conduction.

This study aims to describe and compare assemblies of Culicidae that breed in artificial containers in two areas with different degrees of urbanisation where Ae. albopictus is present and to evaluate possible biotic interactions. We sampled container larval habitats of an urban (Eldorado city) and a rural environment (Colonia Aurora village). We performed generalized linear mixed models to evaluate which variables (containers characteristics or environment) are associated with the presence and abundance of Ae. albopictus, Aedes aegypti Linneaus and Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and the presence of mosquito predators (Lutzia bigoti (Bellardi) and Toxorhynchites spp.). Also, the relationship between the most abundant species was quantified in each environment using Hurlbert's C8 association coefficient. Ae. aegypti was the most abundant species in the urban environment, while Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. albopictus were the most abundant in the rural area. Predators were more present in the rural environment and affected the abundance of Aedes mosquitoes. Regarding the C8 index, Ae. aegypti was negatively associated with Ae. albopictus in the urban area, whereas in the rural area these species presented a significantly positive relationship. These results show that in urban environments the high abundance of Ae. aegypti could be affecting the Asian tiger mosquito as evidenced by local studies of food larval competition. Also a greater presence of predators could be affecting Ae. albopictus in rural environments.

This study utilizes a dyadic data analysis approach to study patient-dental student provider communication in an academic dental clinic. ProceduresUsing pairwise data collected from patient-dental student provider dyads, we conducted unadjusted and adjusted actor-partner interdependence models to examine the association of intrapersonal (actor) and interpersonal (partner) effects of three communication skills on the assessment of appointment interaction among patient-dental student provider dyads in a pre-doctoral comprehensive care academic dental clinic setting. Main findingsActor effects were most evident among the associations in the study. Dental student providers' assessment of their own shared decision-making predicted positive changes in their overall interaction assessment in both unadjusted and fully adjusted models. Patients' ratings of their dental student provider's capability/confidence predicted positive changes in their overall interaction assessment in both unadjusted and adjusted models. ConclusionsThis study suggests that dental students and their patients are primarily impacted by actor perspectives regarding dental student communication and its impact on the assessment of their respective overall appointment interaction. Findings suggest a need for the incorporation of interpersonal skill building in collaboration with patients to strengthen the communication skills and practice of dental students.

Previous studies jointly analyzed patients with left hemispheric and patients with right hemispheric lesions when investigating a behavior of interest. An alternative approach would be to perform analyses separated by hemisphere, which has been applied in only a minority of studies to date. The present simulation study investigated whether joint or separate analyses (or both equally) are appropriate to reveal the ground truth disconnections. In fact, both approaches resulted in very different patterns of disconnection. In contrast to analyses separated by hemisphere, joint analyses introduced a bias to the disadvantage of intra-hemispheric disconnections. Intra-hemispheric disconnections were statistically underpowered in the joint analysis and thus surpassed the significance threshold with more difficulty compared to inter-hemispheric disconnections. This statistical imbalance was also shown by a greater number of significant inter-hemispheric than significant intra-hemispheric disconnections. This bias from joint analyses is based on mechanisms similar to those underlying the "partial injury problem." We therefore conclude that pairwise structural disconnections in patients with unilateral left hemispheric and with unilateral right hemispheric lesions exhibiting a specific behavior (or disorder) of interest should be studied separately by hemisphere rather than in a joint analysis.

In these two complexes, the radical ligand binds two Cu-II ions through its two pyridine groups to produce 1D chain while the aminoxyl moiety of the radical is bound to a Ln (III) ion. Direct-current magnetic susceptibility investigations indicate that ferromagnetic exchanges are dominant and magnetic susceptibility data of Gd derivative are analyzed using a magnetic model, indicating that Cu-NO coupling through pyridine group and Gd-NO direct exchange are ferromagnetic interactions. There is no magnetic relaxation behavior for Dy analogue.

We also discuss the importance of the choice of basis set for the Th atoms and issues regarding locating QTAIM bond critical points. When taken together, the computed data consistently suggest the presence of delocalised Th-Th bonding and Th-3 & sigma;-aromaticity.	[Tomecek, Josef; Liddle, Stephen T.

MethodsThis was a retrospective study including 100 women diagnosed with type I/II CSP. Patients were treated with either ultrasound-guided SC (SC group) or hysteroscopy resection (surgery group). The success rates, mean operation time, hospitalization duration, hospitalization cost, risk factors, adverse events, and complications were analyzed. ResultsThe success rate of the SC and surgery groups were 85% and 100%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.032). There was one case of type I CSP and eight cases of type II CSP that failed SC treatment. No failed cases were found in the surgery group. Analysis of the causes of treatment failure revealed that diameter of the gestational sac was a risk factor for SC failure (odds ratio, 19.66 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.70-227.72], P = 0.017). Comparing the clinical outcomes between the SC and surgery groups, although the mean operation time of the SC group was significantly shorter than the surgery group (15 [CI, 15-20] vs. 30 [CI, 27-40], P = 0.001), the cost and duration of hospitalization were significantly lower in the surgery group than that in the SC group. No significant differences were observed for adverse events and complications between the two groups (P > 0.05). ConclusionHysteroscopy is an effective and economical method for treating type I/II CSP. Moreover, SC is not recommended for patients with type I/II CSP with a gestation age & GE;8 weeks.

Here, we develop a novel, modular, and efficient click reaction for connecting primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohols with activated alkenes via a bridge molecule of carbonyl sulfide (COS). The click reaction is successfully applied to synthesize a series of recyclable polymers by the step polyaddition of diols, diacrylates, and COS. Diols and diacrylates are common chemicals and can be produced from biorenewable sources, and COS is released as the industrial waste. In addition to sustainable monomers, the approach is atom-economical, wide in scope, metal-free, and performed under mild conditions, affording unprecedented polymers with nearly quantitative yields. The produced polymers also possess predesigned and widely tunable structure owing to the versatility of our method and the broad variety of monomers. The in-chain thiocarbonate and ester polar groups can play as breakpoints, allowing these polymers to be easily recycled. Overall, the polymers have broad prospects for green materials given their facile synthesis, readily available feedstocks, desirable performance, and chemical recyclability.

However, off-target induced unintended tissue effects and intrinsic "hook effect" hinder PROTAC biotechnology to be maturely developed. Herein, an intracellular fabricated nano proteolysis targeting chimeras (Nano-PROTACs) modality with a center-spoke degradation network for achieving efficient dose-dependent protein degradation in tumor is reported. The PROTAC precursors are triggered by higher GSH concentrations inside tumor cells, which subsequently in situ self-assemble into Nano-PROTACs through intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions. The fibrous Nano-PROTACs can form effective polynary complexes and E3 ligases degradation network with multi-binding sites, achieving dose-dependent protein degradation with "anti-hook effect". The generality and efficacy of Nano-PROTACs are validated by degrading variable protein of interest (POI) such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and androgen receptor (AR) in a wide-range dose-dependent manner with a 95 % degradation rate and long-lasting potency up to 72 h in vitro. Significantly, Nano-PROTACs achieve in vivo dose-dependent protein degradation up to 79 % and tumor growth inhibition in A549 and LNCap xenograft mice models, respectively. Taking advantages of in situ self-assembly strategy, the Nano-PROTACs provide a generalizable platform to promote precise clinical translational application of PROTAC.

This paper establishes two generalisations of this result. First, we extend the Kim-Tamagawa theorem to the case that Y$Y$ is a smooth variety of any dimension. Second, we formulate and prove the analogue of the Kim-Tamagawa theorem in the case l=p$\ell =p$, again in arbitrary dimension. In the course of proving the latter, we give a proof of an etale-de Rham comparison theorem for pro-unipotent fundamental groupoids using methods of Scholze and Diao-Lan-Liu-Zhu. This extends the comparison theorem proved by Vologodsky for certain truncations of the fundamental groupoids.

We identified rates and predictors of PCP visits both during and after treatment among a population-based cohort of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MethodsChildren of age less than 18 years at ALL diagnosis in Ontario between 2002 and 2012 were linked to administrative data and matched to controls without cancer. PCPs at diagnosis were identified and PCP visit rates during treatment compared between patients and controls. Post-treatment PCP visit rates were also calculated. Predictors included demographic-, disease-, and PCP-related variables. ResultsA total of 743/793 (94%) patients and 3112/3947 (79%) controls had a PCP at diagnosis. Almost half of patients (361/743, 45%) did not visit their PCP during treatment. Visit rate during treatment was 0.64 per person per year (PPPY) versus 1.4 PPPY among controls (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 0.47, 95th confidence interval [95CI]: 0.40-0.54; p < .0001). No disease- or PCP-related factors were associated with visit rates. Total 711 patients completed frontline therapy; 287 (40.4%) did not have a PCP visit after treatment. Nonetheless, survivors overall visited PCPs post treatment more often than controls (aRR 1.4, 95CI: 1.2-1.6; p < .0001). Survivors who saw their PCP during treatment had post-treatment visit rates twice that of other survivors (aRR 2.0, 95CI: 1.6-2.5; p < .0001). ConclusionsOnly a portion of children with ALL see their PCPs during treatment and return to PCP care following treatment completion. Post-treatment engagement with PCPs may be improved by PCP involvement during ALL treatment.

Material and MethodsRNA sequencing of 116 patients with cervical cancer was conducted. Fusion genes were extracted using StarFusion program. To identify a high-risk group for recurrence, 65 patients who received postoperative adjuvant therapy were subjected to non-negative matrix factorization to identify differentially expressed genes between recurrent and nonrecurrent groups. ResultsWe identified three cases with FGFR3-TACC3 and one with GOPC-ROS1 fusion genes as potential targets. A search of publicly available data from cBioPortal (21,789 cases) and the Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics (32,608 cases) showed that the FGFR3 fusion is present in 1.5% and 0.6% of patients with cervical cancer, respectively. The frequency of the FGFR3 fusion gene was higher in cervical cancer than in other cancers, regardless of ethnicity. Non-negative matrix factorization identified that the patients were classified into four Basis groups. Pathway enrichment analysis identified more extracellular matrix kinetics dysregulation in Basis 3 and more immune system dysregulation in Basis 4 than in the good prognosis group. CIBERSORT analysis showed that the fraction of M1 macrophages was lower in the poor prognosis group than in the good prognosis group. ConclusionsThe distribution of FGFR fusion genes in patients with cervical cancer was determined by RNA-based analysis and used to classify patients into clinically relevant subgroups.

Using a two-stage least squares panel regression model and a specification akin to difference-in-differences technique, our results suggest that an income shock of any magnitude reduced the dietary diversity of households across India, though the impact has been more severe in the rural areas compared to urban and during the first year of the pandemic compared to the second. The mediating role of household socio-economic characteristics, pandemic indicators and food prices is also examined.

In this work, a combination of synchrotron-based techniques and electrochemical methods is used to investigate the passive film breakdown of a Ni-Cr-Mo alloy, which is used in many industrial applications. This alloy is found to be active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the OER onset coincides with the loss of passivity and severe metal dissolution. The OER mechanism involves the oxidation of Mo4+ sites in the oxide film to Mo6+ that can be dissolved, which results in passivity breakdown. This is fundamentally different from typical transpassive breakdown of Cr-containing alloys where Cr6+ is postulated to be dissolved at high anodic potentials, which is not observed here. At high current densities, OER also leads to acidification of the solution near the surface, further triggering metal dissolution. The OER plays an important role in the mechanism of passivity breakdown of Ni-Cr-Mo alloys due to their catalytic activity, and this effect needs to be considered when studying the corrosion of catalytically active alloys.

However, the CO2RR mechanism and the origin of activity at the single-atom sites remain unclear, which hinders the development of single-atom M-N-2 catalysts. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we reveal intermediates-induced CO2RR activity at the single-atom M-N-2 sites. At the M-N-2 sites, the asymmetric *O*CO configuration tends to split into *CO and *OH intermediates. Intermediates become part of the active moiety to form M-(CO)N-2 or M-(OH)N-2 sites, which optimizes the adsorption of intermediates on the M sites. The maximum free energy differences along the optimal CO2RR pathway are 0.30, 0.54, and 0.28 eV for Fe-(OH)N-2, Co-(CO)N-2, and Ni-(OH)N-2 sites respectively, which is lower than those of Fe-N-2 (1.03 eV), Co-N-2 (1.24 eV) and Ni-N-2 (0.73 eV) sites. The intermediate modification can shift the d-band center of the spin-up (minority) state downward by regulating the charge distribution at the M sites, leading to less charge being accepted by the intermediates from the M sites. This work provides new insights into the understanding of the activity of single-atom M-N-2 sites.
