For this purpose, a 3D reconstruction of a reference electrode has been obtained by X-ray nano-holotomography. Then, a large dataset of synthetic microstructures has been generated around this reference with the truncated Gaussian random field method, varying the ratio Ni/8YSZ and the Ni particle size. All the synthetic microstructures have been introduced in a multiscale modeling approach to analyze the impact of the microstructure on the electrode and cell responses. The local electrode polarization resistance in the hydrogen electrode, as well as the complete cell impedance spectra, have been computed for the different microstructures. A significant performance improvement was found when decreasing the Ni particle size distribution. Moreover, an optimum has been identified in terms of electrode composition allowing the minimization of the cell polarization resistance. The same methodology has been also applied to assess the relevance of graded electrodes. All these results allow a better understanding of the precise role of microstructure on cell performances and provide useful guidance for cell manufacturing.

BackgroundAs part of wider policy initiatives to address workforce shortages, provide progression for healthcare assistants and offer alternative routes into nursing, England recently introduced the nursing associate level of practice. Little research has yet considered university perspectives on this new programme. MethodsAn exploratory qualitative study reported following COREQ criteria. Twenty-seven university staff working with trainee nursing associates in five universities across England were recruited. Data, collected via semi-structured interviews from June to September 2021, were analysed through a combined framework and thematic analysis. ResultsThree themes developed: 'Centrality of partnerships' considered partnerships between employers and universities and changing power dynamics. 'Adapting for support' included responding to new requirements and changing pedagogical approaches. 'Negotiating identity' highlighted the university's role in advocacy and helping trainees develop a student identity. ConclusionsNursing associate training in England has changed the dynamics between universities and healthcare employers, shifting learners' identity more to 'employee' rather than 'student'. Universities have adapted to support trainees in meeting academic and professional standards whilst also meeting employer expectations. While challenges remain, the ability of nurse educators to make adjustments, alongside their commitment to quality educational delivery, is helping establish this new training programme and thereby meet government policy initiatives. Implications for nursing policyThe international movement of apprenticeship models in universities has the potential to change the status of the learner in nursing educational contexts. National policies that encourage this model should ensure that the implications and challenges this change of status brings to learners, employers and education institutions are fully considered prior to their implementation.

Orthogonal Design of Experiments for Engineering of Lipid Nanoparticles for mRNA Delivery to the Placenta	SMALL			English	Article; Early Access						lipid nanoparticles; mRNA; placenta; pregnancy; women's health	GOLD NANOPARTICLES; GROWTH; TRANSLOCATION; THERAPEUTICS; OPTIMIZATION; TROPHOBLAST; TRANSPORT; KINETICS; CELLS; MODEL	During healthy pregnancy, the placenta develops to allow for exchange of nutrients and oxygen between the mother and the fetus. However, placental dysregulation can lead to several pregnancy disorders, such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Recently, lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) has been explored as a promising approach to treat these disorders. Here, iterative libraries of LNPs with varied excipient molar ratios are screened in vitro for enhanced mRNA delivery to placental cells with minimal cytotoxicity when compared to an LNP formulation with a standard excipient molar ratio. LNP C5, the top formulation identified by these screens, demonstrates a fourfold increase in mRNA delivery in vitro compared to the standard formulation. Intravenous administration of LNP C5 to pregnant mice achieves improved in vivo placental mRNA delivery compared to the standard formulation and mediates mRNA delivery to placental trophoblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells. These results identify LNP C5 as a promising optimized LNP formulation for placental mRNA delivery and further validates the design of experiments strategy for LNP excipient optimization to enhance mRNA delivery to cell types and organs of interest.

Comparing iDNA from mosquitoes and flies to survey mammals in a semi-controlled Neotropical area	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article; Early Access						biodiversity; biomonitoring; invertebrate-derived DNA; metabarcoding; vertebrate survey	FLY-DERIVED DNA; ENVIRONMENTAL DNA; BIODIVERSITY; TOOL; IDENTIFICATION	Ingested-derived DNA (iDNA) from insects represents a powerful tool for assessing vertebrate diversity because insects are easy to sample, have a diverse diet and are widely distributed. Because of these advantages, the use of iDNA for detecting mammals has gained increasing attention. Here we aimed to compare the effectiveness of mosquitoes and flies to detect mammals with a small sampling effort in a semi-controlled area, a zoo that houses native and non-native species. We compared mosquitoes and flies regarding the number of mammal species detected, the amount of mammal sequence reads recovered, and the flight distance range for detecting mammals. We also verified if the combination of two mini-barcodes (12SrRNA and 16SrRNA) would perform better than either mini-barcode alone to inform local mammal biodiversity from iDNA. To capture mosquitoes and flies, we distributed insect traps in eight sampling points during 5 days. We identified 43 Operational Taxonomic Units from 10 orders, from the iDNA of 17 mosquitoes and 46 flies. There was no difference in the number of species recovered per individual insect between mosquitoes and flies, but the number of flies captured was higher, resulting in more mammal species recovered by flies. Eight species were recorded exclusively by mosquitoes and 20 by flies, suggesting that using both samplers would allow a more comprehensive screening of the biodiversity. The maximum distance recorded was 337 m for flies and 289 m for mosquitoes, but the average range distance did not differ between insect groups. Our assay proved to be efficient for mammal detection, considering the high number of species detected with a reduced sampling effort.

During the past decades, developments of these CG models are roughly in two directions, that is, generic and chemically system-specific models. The developme of the formmer focuses on the capability of the model to capature the general properties of the system, for instance, scaling relations between both structural and dynamic properties with respect to chain length. On the other hand, to bridging the gap between physics and chemistry, chemically-specifi models are also widely developed which are able to retain the inherent chemical-physical properties for a given polymer system. However, due to the reduction of atomistic degree of freedom a faithful reproduction of structure and especialy dynamics properties of the system is the maijor challenge. In this review, after a brief introduction of some widely used generic models, we present an overview of both recent achievements and remainning challendges in the development of chemically-specific CG approaches, for the simulations of polymer systems.This article is categorized under:Structure and Mechanism > Computational Materials ScienceMolecular and Statistical Mechanics > Molecular Dynamics and Monte-Carlo Methods	[Shi, Rui; Qian, Hu-Jun; Lu, Zhong-Yuan] Jilin Univ, Inst Theoret Chem, Coll Chem, State Key Lab Supramol Struct & Mat, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Qian, Hu-Jun; Lu, Zhong-Yuan] Jilin Univ, Inst Theoret Chem, Coll Chem, Key Lab Supramol Struct & Mat, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China	Jilin University; Jilin University	Qian, HJ; Lu, ZY (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Inst Theoret Chem, Coll Chem, Key Lab Supramol Struct & Mat, Changchun 130023, Peoples R China.	hjqian@jlu.edu.cn; luzhy@jlu.edu.cn			National Key Ramp;D Program of China [2022YFB3707302]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [21833008, 22133002]	National Key Ramp;D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFB3707302) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 21833008, 22133002).		150	0	0	21	21	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1759-0876	1759-0884		WIRES COMPUT MOL SCI	Wiley Interdiscip.

Randomized clinical trial: A phase 2b controlled study of the efficacy and safety of trazpiroben (TAK-906) for idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						gastric emptying; gastroparesis; motility; symptom score or index; trazpiroben	SYMPTOMS; METOCLOPRAMIDE; DOMPERIDONE; SEVERITY	BackgroundPrevious clinical studies of trazpiroben, a dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor antagonist for long-term treatment of moderate-to-severe idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis, have shown improved symptoms of fullness. This study assessed trazpiroben efficacy, safety, and tolerability in adults with idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis versus placebo. MethodsThis global, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2b study (NCT03544229) enrolled eligible adults aged 18-85 years with symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis. Randomized participants received either oral placebo or trazpiroben 5, 25, or 50 mg, administered twice daily over 12 weeks, and completed the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index-Daily Diary. Change in weekly composite score from baseline to week 12 (primary endpoint) and treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed. Data were summarized descriptively. Key ResultsOverall, 242 participants were enrolled (mean [standard deviation] age 55.7 [14.2] years; 75.6% female); 193 completed the study. No significant differences in change from baseline in weekly average of the daily diary composite score occurred at week 12 between placebo (least-squares mean [standard error] -1.19 [0.12]) and trazpiroben (5, 25, and 50 mg: -1.11 [0.22], -1.17 [0.12], and -1.21 [0.12], respectively). Overall, 41.4% of participants receiving trazpiroben reported treatment-emergent adverse events (placebo, 39.7%). No serious events were considered trazpiroben-related; no life-threatening or fatal events were reported. Conclusions & InferencesThere was no clinically meaningful difference in efficacy between trazpiroben and placebo in treating gastroparesis, based on the primary endpoint analysis. Trazpiroben was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified, strengthening evidence supporting its favorable safety profile.NCT number: NCT03544229.

However, the efficacy of ICI monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression <50% has not yet been fully elucidated.The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression <50% who respond to single-agent ICIs and factors that predict response.Methods: Patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 50% or less who received new monotherapy with an ICI between July 2012 and December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with response were compared with those without response in the post-treatment response assessment.Results: Among the 37 patients, six (16.2%) NSCLC patients in the response group responded to ICI monotherapy and had a significantly lower body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003). Significantly more patients in the response group developed immune related adverse events (irAEs) than in the nonresponse group (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified high BMI as a significant independent risk factor predicting nonresponse to ICI monotherapy in NSCLC patients with PD-L1 < 50%.Conclusions: Among NSCLC patients with PD-L1 < 50%, those with a higher BMI were more likely to be nonresponders to ICI monotherapy. In addition, the group that responded to ICI monotherapy may have been at higher risk of developing irAEs, suggesting that careful follow-up is warranted.

To gather the maximum amount of energy from a PV array under partial shading conditions (PSCs), it is necessary to follow the largest peak in the power-voltage (P-V) curve. PV cells are partially or totally shaded due to atmospheric conditions, which show multiple peaks in the PV curve. To overcome the losses occurring due to PSCs, PV array reconfiguration action is advisable. The authors of this work proposed a novel 5x5 $5\times 5$ quad-tied PV array configuration and compared its performance to that of other current configurations such as series-parallel, total-cross tied, and others in terms of global maximum power point tracking, mismatch loss, fill factor, and efficiency. The MATLAB/Simulink 2020a platform was used to generate PV array curves under various shading conditions.

The primary endpoint was MACE, which was defined as the composite of all-cause death, repeat coronary artery revascularisation, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. The patients were grouped by the TyG index and EuroSCORE II tertiles and the combination of these risk indicators.Results: During the follow-up, 211 individuals developed MACE. Elevated levels of the TyG index and EuroSCORE II were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The hazard ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 3.66 (2.34-5.73) in patients with the highest tertile of the TyG index and EuroSCORE II. Compared with the Euro-SCORE II alone, combining the TyG index with EuroSCORE II achieved a better predictive performance [C-statistic increased 0.032, p < 0.001; continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) (95% CI): 0.364 (0.215-0.514), p < 0.001; inte-grated discrimination improvement (IDI) (95% CI): 0.015 (0.007-0.023), p < 0.001, Akaike's information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) decreased, and the likelihood ratio test, p < 0.001].Conclusions: The TyG index and EuroSCORE II are independently associated with poor prognosis. Furthermore, the TyG index is an important adjunct to the Euro-SCORE II for improving risk stratification and guiding early intervention among post-CABG patients.

This transformation relies on reorganising the configurational relationships between the orientations of intrinsic polarities of neighbouring cells. These orientational intercellular relationships are established, maintained, and modulated by orientational cell adhesions (OCAs). Here, using zebrafish (Danio rerio) neurulation as a major model, we propose a new perspective on how OCAs contribute to the parallel, antiparallel, and opposing intercellular relationships that underlie the neural plate-keel-rod-tube transformation, a stepwise process of cell aggregation followed by cord hollowing. We also discuss how OCAs in neurulation may be regulated by various adhesion molecules, including cadherins, Eph/Ephrins, Claudins, Occludins, Crumbs, Na+/K+-ATPase, and integrins. By comparing neurulation among species, we reveal that antiparallel OCAs represent a conserved mechanism for the fusion of the neural tube. Throughout, we highlight some outstanding questions regarding OCAs in neurulation. Answers to these questions will help us understand better the mechanisms of tubulogenesis of many tissues.

The proposed antenna has an overall dimension of pi x 13. 2(2) x 0.635 mm(3) and uses an RT3010 substrate of thickness 0.635 mm. Each element of MIMO has a spiral structure made of meandered line to realize resonance at 915 MHz, while an arc is etched in each element for obtaining a band of 403 MHz. Semicircular slots are etched in each quadrant of the ground plane for better impedance matching at the higher band of 2.4 GHz. In a -10 dB fractional bandwidth of 95%, 45.36% is attained for the realized bands. Simulation in a skin phantom provides better impedance matching and mutual coupling of less than -15 dB in the three operating bands.

As these systems become increasingly integrated into organizational practices and processes, understanding their impact on workers' experiences and job designs is critical. However, the ongoing discourse surrounding AI use in the workplace remains divided. Proponents of the technology extol its benefits for enhancing efficiency and productivity, while others voice concerns about the potential harm to human workers. To provide greater clarity on this pressing issue, this article presents a systematic review of empirical research that sheds light on the implications of AI use at work. Organized under five inductively generated themes within a multilevel framework, we uncover individual, group, and organizational factors that shape the interplay between humans and AI. Specifically, the themes are: (1) human-AI collaboration; (2) perceptions of algorithmic and human capabilities; (3) worker attitudes towards AI; (4) AI as a control mechanism in algorithmic management of platform-based work; and (5) labor market implications of AI use. Our review offers insights into these themes and identifies five pathways for future research. Finally, we provide practical recommendations for organizational leaders seeking to implement AI technologies while prioritizing their employees' well-being.

For large experiments, a single square tungsten block is often used for every treatment since conformal blocks are both patient and field specific, and require long lead times for fabrication. Future synchrotron radiotherapy treatments would benefit from a dynamic collimator system. PurposeWe developed and tested a novel collimator design for use on the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) at the ANSTO Australian Synchrotron. MethodsThe maximum usable beam size on IMBL is 50-mm wide by 3-mm tall. Given the beam shape, targets must be vertically scanned through the synchrotron beam to cover the target volume. To shape the beam, a novel collimator design was developed, consisting of two semi-circular leaves made from 4-mm thick tungsten sheets, with each leaf capable of both vertical and horizontal movement. A software model was created to optimize motor trajectories and generate deliverable treatment fields. A series of geometric field shapes and clinical target volumes were delivered using the collimator and imaged with a digital imaging detector. Four similarity metrics (volumetric similarity, DICE, and the average and maximum Hausdorff distances) were used to measure differences between the input and planned fields, and the planned and delivered fields. ResultsDifferences between input and planned fields increased with delivery speed, and were worse for rectangular and square fields compared to circular fields. However, the differences between planned and delivered fields were small, where the maximum average deviation between the fields was 0.25 mm (one pixel). Field repeatability was consistent with no difference (& sigma; = 0 for all metrics) observed in consecutively delivered fields. ConclusionsWe have successfully built and demonstrated a novel collimator for synchrotron radiotherapy applications on IMBL. Several design improvements have been highlighted and will be addressed in future revisions the collimator. However, in its current state, the collimator enables dynamically delivered conformal treatment fields to be utilized on IMBL, and is ready to support the forthcoming canine treatments on IMBL.

This paper analyzes the evolution of employment created by cooperatives in the different Spanish regions in relation to total employment between 1999 and 2019 with a pioneering approach. We analyze the existence of convergence clubs among the Spanish regions using the methodology developed by Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009). The results show the existence of four clubs that include the regions that converge in relative terms of cooperative employment over the 20 years analyzed. The lack of homogeneity in the behavior of employment in cooperatives in the different Spanish regions is demonstrated, with certain divergences among regions. These divergences make it difficult to establish a model of cooperative employment for the whole of Spain.

On its own, the mere mathematical idea of a dynamical system is too weak to serve as a scientific theory of anything, and dynamical approaches within cognitive science are too rich and varied to be subsumed under a single "dynamical hypothesis." Instead, after first attempting to dissect the different notions of "dynamics" and "cognition" at play, a more specific theoretical framework for cognitive science broadly construed is sketched. This framework draws upon not only dynamical ideas, but also such contemporaneous perspectives as situatedness, embodiment, ecological psychology, enaction, neuroethology/neuroscience, artificial life, and biogenic approaches. The paper ends with some methodological suggestions for pursuing this theoretical framework.

Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a plausibly exogenous shock hitting the whole economy, we compare workers who worked in unionized and non-unionized workplaces directly before the pandemic in a difference-in-differences framework. We find that unionized workers were substantially more likely to remain working for their pre-COVID employer and to be in employment. This greater employment stability was not traded off against lower working hours or labor income.

However, whether this association is equivalent across ages or genders in the older population remains unclear. Thus, we examined the association between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and gait speed emphasising the influence of age and gender. MethodsOverall, 8233 Japanese participants aged & GE;65 years were enrolled in this cross-sectional study between 2016 and 2018. After stratification by gender and age group, the participants' gait speeds were divided into quintiles, and the difference in MCI prevalence at each gait speed quintile was calculated. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the odds of MCI for each quintile and to assess the influence of age and gender. ResultsMales had a consistently higher prevalence of MCI than females. The odds of MCI were increased as gait speed decreased. Logistic regression analyses revealed that in the multivariable-adjusted model 2, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval; CI) for MCI were 2.02 (1.47-2.76) for females and 1.75 (1.29-2.38) for males in the slowest gait speed quintiles compared to the fastest quintile. In the stratified analyses, only males showed an age-dependent increase in the associations between gait speed and MCI, while females exhibited comparable associations across age groups. ConclusionsReduced gait speed was associated with increased odds of MCI, and this association may vary according to gender and age. Therefore, gait speed could serve as a valuable screening tool for MCI, with gender- and age-dependent clinical implications.

The need to have instruments that assess SLE easily and quickly underpins the objective of this study, which is to validate a short version of the questionnaire of stressful life events (QSLE). 124 patients with first-episode psychosis and 218 healthy controls aged between 11 and 52 years were recruited. The QSLE scale underwent discrimination analysis, which revealed 18 items had good SLEs discriminability between the two samples. These 18 items were then used to create the shorter QSLE-SV. The QSLE-SV showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.749). An AUC of 0.830 was observed, suggesting that the predictor was good. Using 2 as the cut-off score to predict an individual as a patient would yield a sensitivity of 91.1% and a specificity of 51.6%, and using a cut-off point of 3, the sensitivity was 77.4% and the specificity was 72.5%. QSLE-SV displayed satisfactory psychometric properties in a Spanish population. The QSLE-SV allows for investigating childhood, adolescent and adult life events by measuring current stress and age on a continuous scale in a quick and easy way.

Our previous studies found that nitazoxanide and its metabolite tizoxanide activated adenosine 5 & PRIME;-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signals. As AMPK activation and/or STAT3 inhibition are targets for treating pulmonary fibrosis, we hypothesized that nitazoxanide would be effective in experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Experimental ApproachThe mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate of cells was measured by using the high-resolution respirometry system Oxygraph-2K. The mitochondrial membrane potential of cells was evaluated by tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) staining. The target protein levels were measured by using western blotting. The mice pulmonary fibrosis model was established through intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. The examination of the lung tissues changes were carried out using haematoxylin and eosin (H & E), and Masson staining. Key ResultsNitazoxanide and tizoxanide activated AMPK and inhibited STAT3 signalling in human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5 cells). Nitazoxanide and tizoxanide inhibited transforming growth factor-& beta;1 (TGF-& beta;1)-induced proliferation and migration of MRC-5 cells, collagen-I and & alpha;-smooth muscle cell actin (& alpha;-SMA) expression, and collagen-I secretion from MRC-5 cells. Nitazoxanide and tizoxanide inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibited TGF-& beta;1-induced Smad2/3 activation in mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12 cells). Oral administration of nitazoxanide reduced the bleomycin-induced mice pulmonary fibrosis and, in the established bleomycin-induced mice, pulmonary fibrosis. Delayed nitazoxanide treatment attenuated the fibrosis progression. Conclusions and ImplicationsNitazoxanide improves the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, suggesting a potential application of nitazoxanide for pulmonary fibrosis treatment in the clinic.

E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is currently an important pest of maize crops worldwide not only because of its dispersal ability but also because of its polyphagous feeding behaviour. Lack of sufficient information on the management of the fall armyworm attacks remains a crucial problem for maize smallholder farmers in Africa. In this study, 420 farmers were surveyed in central and west Africa using individual interviews to assess farmers' knowledges and perceptions of the fall armyworm damages and the management practices used. Most farmers (99.4%) were shown to recognize the fall armyworm and 92.5% claimed to already have damages in their fields. The fall armyworm seems not to be a new pest as most farmers identified it in different countries from 2015 to 2019. Apart from maize as the preferred crop of S. frugiperda, several alternative host plants including Napier grass, sorghum, onion, and cabbage were identified by the farmers. Although cultural and mechanical control methods are used by several farmers, the synthetic pesticide market is still preferred by almost half of the farmers (44.28%) who still use them. To control fall armyworm, 96.4% in Burkina Faso, 85.3% in Gabon, 65.2% in Benin and 25% in DR Congo reported using insecticides, against 5.9% in Senegal. Semiochemical-based method and biological control by promoting natural enemies of the fall armyworm are new concepts for farmers in DR Congo, Gabon and Benin. To avoid additional problems regarding health and resilience of agricultural systems, alternative methods such as push-pull approach, the development of biopesticides and resistant cultivars should form the basis of training given to farmers and should be popularized for sustainable control of the fall armyworm in central and west Africa.

Limestone applications attempt to reverse acidification by increasing stream pH; however, liming can have variable effects on stream biota. We examined the effects of liming on spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) abundance in West Virginia, USA, from 10 June to 1 September 2013. We used multiple methods (i.e., leaf litterbags, visual encounter surveys, area constrained flip and search) to sample spring salamanders within 11 different streams in the Monongahela National Forest. Using N-mixture models, which allow for estimation of abundance from count data and account for imperfect detection probabilities, we examined the effects of direct application liming (DAL) on spring salamander abundance. Direct application liming at a higher lime frequency did not have a significant effect on salamander abundance; however, we observed differences in spring salamander size in areas near the DAL site. These results have influenced management of limed streams and will enlighten managers to the effects of high frequency liming on salamander communities and other stream organisms, and will provide insights on how to mitigate potential impacts as a result of liming practices.

Data were collected from 14 RNs during the period from January 2022 to May 2022 using a semi-structured interview guide. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse data using an abductive approach.Results: Three categories describe the RNs' experiences; (1) Situations that cause work-related stress, (2) Reactions and feelings that occur and (3) Management of work-related stress. These three main categories included a total of 12 subcategories. Work-related stress was experienced when participants were a part of traumatic events or experienced insufficient cooperation or a disturbing event in the work environment. The different causes lead to different kinds of reactions with feelings of frustration, fear and loneliness being prominent. To manage the work-related stress, RNs used different kinds of strategies and support from colleagues or lack thereof seemed to have a major impact.Conclusions: Findings revealed the importance of having competent colleagues in the AS. Working with a competent colleague can reduce experiences of stress and prevent feelings of loneliness. It is important for the AS to provide stress-reduction support, to promote cooperation and to maintain and develop RNs' professional competence to ensure quality care and patient safety in the AS.

This study introduces Hystrix kayae sp. nov., a new Late Miocene porcupine initially classified as Hystrix sp. Yavuz et al., 2018. This finding expands our knowledge of Late Miocene Anatolian porcupines, bringing the total number of known species to three. H. kayae sp. nov. is larger than Hystrix aryanensis and exhibits greater upper cheek tooth crown height. Its cheek tooth morphology differs from Hystrix depereti, and it possesses distinctive U-shaped choanae unlike Hystrix primigenia. The corakyerler locality may predate sites with H. aryanensis and H. primigenia but aligns temporally with Hystrix parvae localities. This study enhances our understanding of Late Miocene porcupine diversity in Anatolia, emphasizing the importance of corakyerler in unraveling the evolutionary history of these fascinating mammals.

Building-integrated PVs that require high efficiency are attractive, but aesthetics play key roles in these urban applications. One of the most challenging problems with respect to aesthetic PV cells is the efficiency loss due to color tuning. Here, we demonstrate for the first time lossless full-color tunable PV cells based on the use of textured luminescent down-shifting (LDS) films with LDS dyes with ultraviolet-selective absorption. The LDS anti-reflection (AR) films improve the perovskite/Si tandem cell efficiency by reducing the loss of parasitic UV absorption of the layers above the perovskite film due to LDS effect and the loss due to cell reflection due to the textured surface. Therefore, color tuning with LDS AR films can be used to produce highly aesthetic and efficient PV cells for urban applications.

Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth seeking mental health treatment in Texas: Youth Depression and Suicide Network research registry	SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Early Access						depression; suicide; youth	INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW; GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; UNITED-STATES; SELF-REPORT; ADOLESCENTS; PREVENTION; VALIDATION; SCALE; PREVALENCE	IntroductionSuicidality in youth is a serious public health problem. The Texas Youth Depression and Suicide Research Network (TX-YDSRN) was initiated in 2020 to create a research registry for youth with depression and/or suicidality in Texas. This report presents baseline clinical/demographic characteristics of the first 1000 participants, focusing on suicidal thoughts and behaviors. MethodsThe registry includes 8-20-year-old youth receiving treatment for depression, or who screen positive for depression and/or suicidal ideation/behavior. Baseline data include diagnosis, depression/anxiety severity, suicidal ideation/behavior, trauma history, and measures of resilience. ResultsWe present baseline data on the first 1000 participants. Most (79.6%) of the sample had a primary depressive disorder. The sample had moderate to severe depression (Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents, PHQ-A; 12.9 & PLUSMN; 6.4) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7; 11.3 & PLUSMN; 5.9). Nearly half reported & GE;1 lifetime suicide attempts and 90% reported lifetime or current suicidal ideation. Participants with past/current suicidality (attempts and/or ideation) had greater illness severity (depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts/behaviors), lower resilience, and higher rates of trauma exposure than those without suicidality. ConclusionsBaseline data indicate moderate levels of depression, anxiety, and suicidality and their correlates in this cohort. Future reports will determine trajectories of outcomes and predictors, moderators, and social determinants related to these outcomes.

As a next step, tools to generate genome modifications in a spatially and temporally precise manner will enable researchers to further dissect gene function. Here, we present two heat shock-inducible genome-editing (IGE) systems that efficiently edit target genes when the system is induced, thus allowing us to target specific developmental stages. For this conditional editing system, we chose the natural heat-inducible promoter from heat-shock protein 18.2 (HSP18.2) from Arabidopsis thaliana and the synthetic heat-inducible promoter heat shock-response element HSE-COR15A to drive the expression of Cas9. We tested these two IGE systems in Arabidopsis using cyclic or continuous heat-shock treatments at the seedling and bolting stages. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the HSP18.2 IGE system exhibited higher Cas9 expression levels than the HSE-COR15A IGE system upon both cyclic and continuous treatments. By targeting brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1) and phytoene desaturase (PDS), we demonstrate that both cyclic and continuous heat inductions successfully activated the HSP18.2 IGE system at the two developmental stages, resulting in highly efficient targeted mutagenesis and clear phenotypic outcomes. By contrast, the HSE-COR15A IGE system was only induced at the seedling stage and was less effective than the HSP18.2 IGE system in terms of mutagenesis frequencies. The presented heat shock-IGE systems can be conditionally induced to efficiently inactivate genes at any developmental stage and are uniquely suited for the dissection and systematic characterization of essential genes.

The gut is the first line of defense against pathogens that enter through the mouth. Staphylococcus aureus was used to infect the O. furnacalis midgut to understand the midgut immune mechanism against exogenous pathogens to provide new ideas and methods for the prevention and control of O. furnacalis. A sequencing platform was used for genome assembly and gene expression. The unigene sequences were annotated and functionally classified by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Significant differences were found in the induced expression profiles before and after infection. Some differentially expressed genes have important relations with lipid metabolism and immune mechanism, suggesting that they play an important role in the innate immune response of O. furnacalis. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to identify the key genes involved in the signaling pathway, and the expression patterns of these key genes were confirmed. The results could help study the innate immune system of lepidopteran insects and provide theoretical support for the control of related pests and the protection of beneficial insects.

The objective of our study was to determine preoperative factors to individualize and select the most appropriate approach for each patient.Methods: Patients =18 years old undergoing emergent surgery for adhesive small bowel obstruction and internal hernias were evaluated. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were performed to investigate factors related to conversion to open surgery and to the type of adhesions.Results: Of 333 patients, 224 were operated by laparotomy and 109 by laparoscopy (conversion rate: 40%). Previous abdominal wall mesh, type of adhesions, bowel lesion, need for intestinal resection and laparoscopic skills were statistically related to conversion. In the multivariate analysis, complex adhesions (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.5-12.2; P = 0.006), the need for intestinal resection (OR 14.16, 95% CI 2.55-78.68; P = 0.002), and non-advanced laparoscopy surgeons (OR 4.31, 95% CI 1.56-11.94; P = 0.005) were independent factors for conversion to open surgery. ASA III-IV, previous surgeries, previous abdominal mesh and previous adhesiolysis were related to complex adhesions. Previous laparoscopic surgery and internal hernia or closed loop in computed tomography were associated with simple adhesions as a cause of the obstruction. In the multivariate, previous adhesiolysis (OR 4.76, 95% CI 1.23-18.3; P = 0.023) and the findings on computed tomography were significantly related with the type of adhesion.Conclusion: Some preoperative factors allow to individualize the surgical approach in the adhesive small bowel obstruction improving surgical outcomes.

Niche construction and the environmental term of the price equation: How natural selection changes when organisms alter their environments	EVOLUTION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						adaptive plasticity; eco-evo feedbacks; ecosystem engineering; genotype by environment interaction; habitat choice	FISHERS FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM; MATCHING HABITAT CHOICE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES; BEHAVIORAL THERMOREGULATION; HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; INDUCIBLE DEFENSE; POPULATION	Organisms construct their own environments and phenotypes through the adaptive processes of habitat choice, habitat construction, and phenotypic plasticity. We examine how these processes affect the dynamics of mean fitness change through the environmental change term of the Price Equation. This tends to be ignored in evolutionary theory, owing to the emphasis on the first term describing the effect of natural selection on mean fitness (the additive genetic variance for fitness of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem). Using population genetic models and the Price Equation, we show how adaptive niche constructing traits favorably alter the distribution of environments that organisms encounter and thereby increase population mean fitness. Because niche-constructing traits increase the frequency of higher-fitness environments, selection favors their evolution. Furthermore, their alteration of the actual or experienced environmental distribution creates selective feedback between niche constructing traits and other traits, especially those with genotype-by-environment interaction for fitness. By altering the distribution of experienced environments, niche constructing traits can increase the additive genetic variance for such traits. This effect accelerates the process of overall adaption to the niche-constructed environmental distribution and can contribute to the rapid refinement of alternative phenotypic adaptations to different environments. Our findings suggest that evolutionary biologists revisit and reevaluate the environmental term of the Price Equation: owing to adaptive niche construction, it contributes directly to positive change in mean fitness; its magnitude can be comparable to that of natural selection; and, when there is fitness G x E, it increases the additive genetic variance for fitness, the much-celebrated first term.

MethodsA multicenter analysis was performed on patients with sbNETs who underwent preoperative DOTATATE PET imaging and surgical resection, with manual palpation of the entire length of the small bowel, between January 2016 and August 2022. Preoperative imaging reports and blinded secondary imaging reviews were compared to the final postoperative pathology reports. Descriptive statistics were applied. ResultsOne-hundred and four patients met inclusion criteria. Pathology showed 53 (51%) patients had multifocal sbNETs and 96 (92%) had nodal metastases. The original preoperative DOTATATE PET imaging identified multifocal sbNET in 28 (27%) patients and lymph node (LN) metastases in 80 (77%) patients. Based on original radiology reports, sensitivity for multifocal sbNET identification was 45%, specificity was 92%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 86%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 62%. For the identification of LN metastases, sensitivity was 82%, specificity was 88%, PPV was 99%, and NPV was 29%. ConclusionsAlthough DOTATATE PET imaging is specific and relatively accurate, sensitivity and NPV are insufficient to guide surgical planning. Preoperative use should not replace open palpation to identify additional synchronous lesions or to omit regional lymphadenectomy.

The modification of their properties using the reinforcement is of key importance for the possible applications. Layered double hydroxides are materials that are easily synthesized by several techniques giving the possibility to modulate the chemical composition and morphology of the reinforcement and they consist of a divalent and a trivalent anion hydroxide and the layers can be exfoliated and thus provide a material interesting for composite reinforcement. In this paper, Mn was used as a divalent and Al as a trivalent cation. The obtained particles were used as reinforcement for the preparation of composites in 1, 3, and 5 wt% quantities and prepared samples were compared to the matrix consisting of PMMA. Physical mechanical properties of the sample having the best mechanical properties (with 3 wt% of MnAl-LDH filers) exhibited 6.38% modulus of elasticity, 27% hardness, and 10% tensile strength improved values compared to the clear PMMA matrix. Toughness was lowered in this sort of composite compared to the pure matrix.

Effect of infant viral respiratory disease on childhood asthma in a non-industrialized setting	CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ALLERGY			English	Article						asthma; helminths; rhinoconjunctivitis; viral infections; wheeze	SYNCYTIAL-VIRUS; EARLY-LIFE; INFECTIONS; ALLERGY; WHEEZE; RISK; BRONCHIOLITIS	BackgroundThere are limited data from non-industrialized settings on the effects of early life viral respiratory disease on childhood respiratory illness. We followed a birth cohort in tropical Ecuador to understand how early viral respiratory disease, in the context of exposures affecting airway inflammation including ascariasis, affect wheezing illness, asthma, and rhinoconjunctivitis in later childhood. MethodsA surveillance cohort nested within a birth cohort was monitored for respiratory infections during the first 2 years in rural Ecuador and followed for 8 years for the development of wheeze and rhinoconjunctivitis. Nasal swabs were examined for viruses by polymerase chain reaction and respiratory symptom data on recent wheeze and rhinoconjunctivitis were collected by periodic questionnaires at 3, 5, and 8 years. Stools from pregnant mothers and periodically from children aged 2 years were examined microscopically for soil-transmitted helminths. Atopy was measured by allergen skin prick testing at 2 years. Spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide measurement, and nasal washes were performed at 8 years. Associations between clinically significant respiratory disease (CSRD) and wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis at 3, 5, and 8 years were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. ResultsFour hundred and twenty six children were followed of which 67.7% had at least one CSRD episode; 12% had respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)+CSRD and 36% had rhinovirus (RHV)+CSRD. All-cause CSRD was associated with increased wheeze at 3 (OR 2.33 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.23-4.40]) and 5 (OR: 2.12 [95% CI 1.12-4.01]) years. RHV+CSRD was more strongly associated with wheeze at 3 years in STH-infected (STH-infected [OR 13.41, 95% CI 1.56-115.64] vs. uninfected [OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.73-3.84]) and SPT+ (SPT+ [OR 9.42, 95% CI 1.88-47.15] versus SPT- [OR 1.92, 95% CI 0.84-4.38]) children. No associations were observed between CSRD and rhinoconjunctivitis. DiscussionCSRD was significantly associated with childhood wheeze with stronger associations observed for RHV+CSRD in SPT+ and STH-infected children.

J	Auerbach, M				Auerbach, Michael			Optimizing diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in women and girls of reproductive age: Clinical opinion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						anemia; iron deficiency; iron deficiency anemia; iron replacement	RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME; INTRAVENOUS IRON; ORAL IRON; POSTPARTUM ANEMIA; SERUM FERRITIN; SUPPLEMENTATION; TRANSFUSION; HEMOGLOBIN; ABSORPTION; MECHANISMS	Iron deficiency (ID) is the world's most common disorder and one of the top five causes of years lived with disability. Whereas low serum ferritin is diagnostic of ID, ferritin-an acute phase reactant-may be elevated in inflammatory states and the first trimester of pregnancy even if ID exists. Consequently, in early pregnancy or chronic inflammation, percent transferrin saturation (TSAT) measurement is the best indicator of iron status. Unfortunately, current guidelines do not recommend routine screening for ID in either pregnant or nonpregnant women in the absence of anemia. This circumstance should be urgently reviewed based on available data. While oral formulations have long been the standard for iron replacement therapy and are widely available and inexpensive, oral iron is frequently associated with adverse gastrointestinal effects for the majority-a major reason for poor adherence, inadequate repletion, and persisting ID symptoms and sequellae. Although safe intravenous iron administration was introduced in the mid-1950s, formulations with cores binding the elemental iron more tightly became available in the 2000s, allowing complete and safe replacement, even in a single setting. Prospectively acquired neonatology evidence reports oral iron's failure to reach the developing fetus when the mother is iron deficient. Consequently, while oral iron remains frontline in the first trimester because of insufficient safety data for intravenous iron, the author recommends that the intravenous route should be the gold standard for second-trimester ID when hemoglobin concentrations are less than 10.5 g/dL and for all iron-deficient women in their third trimester.

The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive an MRL proposal for the commodity under assessment. An adequate analytical method for enforcement is available to control the residues of trifloxystrobin in honey at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the short-term and long-term intake of residues resulting from the potential transfer of residues into honey assessed in the present MRL application of trifloxystrobin is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. The consumer risk assessment shall be regarded as indicative and affected by uncertainties.				pesticides.mrl@efsa.europa.eu	Bellisai, Giulia/ISU-4238-2023						28	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA		1831-4732		EFSA J	EFSA J.

Euryhaline marine species that migrate between salinity-contrasted habitats have received little attention regarding the role of salinity on whole-genome DNA methylation. Investigation of salinity-induced DNA methylation in fish will help to better understand the potential role of this process in salinity acclimation. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we compared DNA methylation patterns in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) juveniles in seawater and after freshwater transfer. We targeted the gill as a crucial organ involved in plastic responses to environmental changes. To investigate the function of DNA methylation in gills, we performed RNAseq and assessed DNA methylome-transcriptome correlations. We showed a negative correlation between gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels in promoters, first introns and first exons. A significant effect of salinity on DNA methylation dynamics with an overall DNA hypomethylation in freshwater-transferred fish compared to seawater controls was demonstrated. This suggests a role of DNA methylation changes in salinity acclimation. Genes involved in key functions as metabolism, ion transport and transepithelial permeability (junctional complexes) were differentially methylated and expressed between salinity conditions. Expression of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle) was increased, whereas the expression of DNA methyltransferases 3a was repressed. This study reveals novel links between DNA methylation, mainly in promoters and first exons/introns, and gene expression patterns following salinity change.

By applying a water-permselective membrane reactor, water, the byproduct of CO2/CO hydrogenation to ethanol, can be removed. Thus, ethanol formation can be promoted thermodynamically. Accordingly, herein, the thermodynamics of ethanol synthesis by CO2, CO, CO2/CO hydrogenation was investigated, as well as the promoting effects of water removal under various temperatures and pressures by Aspen Plus. It is found that, at medium reaction temperature (e.g., 250 & DEG;C), medium pressure (e.g., 10-50 bar), and medium CO fraction (e.g., 0.1-0.5) together with 1-stage water removal, a CO2/CO equilibrium conversion higher than 80 % can be obtained.

Antibody responses before and after the fourth (second booster) dose of wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine in nursing home residents have not been fully characterized.Methods This study included 112 individuals: 54 nursing home residents (mean age: 84.4 years; 35 SARS-CoV-2-naive and 19 previously infected) and 58 healthcare workers (mean age: 47.7 years; 25 SARS-CoV-2-naive and 33 previously infected). Antispike and antinucleocapsid antibody responses to messenger RNA vaccination were evaluated using serum samples collected shortly and 5 months after the third dose, and shortly after the fourth dose.Results The median immunoglobulin G (IgG) level in SARS-CoV-2-naive residents was similar to that in SARS-CoV-2-naive healthcare workers after the fourth dose (24,026.3 vs. 30,328.6 AU/mL, p = .79), whereas after the third dose the IgG level of SARS-CoV-2-naive residents was approximately twofold lower than that in SARS-CoV-2-naive healthcare workers. In residents with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, timing of infection in relation to vaccination affected the kinetics of antibody responses. Residents infected after the third dose showed the highest IgG levels after the fourth dose among all groups (median: 64,328.8 AU/mL), in contrast to residents infected before initiating vaccination with antibody levels similar to those of SARS-CoV-2-naive residents.Conclusions Advanced aged nursing home residents, poor responders in the initial SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series, could achieve sufficient antibody responses after the fourth (second booster) vaccination, comparable to those of younger adults.

Hopefully, rare individuals have been observed somehow resistant to the parasite, stretching the need to identify the traits underlying this better fitness. Among the candidate to explore at first intention are fast-evolving immune genes, of which toll-like receptor (TLR). In this study, we examined the genetic diversity at 14 TLR loci across P. nobilis, Pinna rudis and P. nobilis x P. rudis hybrid genomes, collected at four physically distant regions, that were found to be either resistant or sensitive to the parasite H. pinnae. We report a high genetic diversity, mainly observed at cell surface TLRs compared with that of endosomal TLRs. However, the endosomal TLR-7 exhibited unexpected level of diversity and haplotype phylogeny. The lack of population structure, associated with a high genetic diversity and elevated dN/dS ratio, was interpreted as balancing selection, though both directional and purifying selection were detected. Interestingly, roughly 40% of the P. nobilis identified as resistant to H. pinnae were introgressed with P. rudis TLR. Specifically, they all carried a TLR-7 of P. rudis origin, whereas sensitive P. nobilis were not introgressed, at least at TLR loci. Small contributions of TLR-6 and TLR-4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to the clustering of resistant and susceptible individuals could be detected, but their specific role in resistance remains highly speculative. This study provides new information on the diversity of TLR genes within the P. nobilis species after MME and additional insights into adaptation to H. pinnae that should contribute to the conservation of this Mediterranean endemic species.

However, research regarding mental and sleep health benefits of following plant-based diets are conflicting. As there are associations between mental/sleep health and various personality traits, and personality may differ between individuals who follow different diets, in this preliminary study, we examined the associations between mental and sleep health and (i) personality and (ii) dietary identity in individuals who follow vegan and vegetarian diets. MethodsCross-sectional data on sociodemographic, personality traits, dietarian identity, overall mental health, depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality were collected from 57 vegan/vegetarian participants between the ages of 18-40. ResultsAfter controlling for various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, linear regression models revealed that (i) higher dietarian private regard was a significant predictor of better overall mental health, (ii) lower levels of extraversion and higher levels of empathy predicted depression, (iii) higher levels of neuroticism and empathy predicted anxiety, (iv) higher levels of neuroticism, dietarian centrality, and neuroticism x centrality predicted stress, (v) higher levels of conscientiousness, lower levels of dietarian centrality, but higher levels of personal motivation and dietary strictness, as well as conscientiousness x centrality, conscientiousness x personal motivation, and conscientiousness x strictness predicted better sleep quality. ConclusionsThese preliminary findings suggest that not only personality traits, but also dietary identity was indeed related to mental and sleep health in individuals who follow plant-based diets.

An automaton-based task is in general more efficient when performed with a DFA rather than an NFA. For any NFA there is an equivalent DFA that can be generated by the classical Subset Construction algorithm. When, however, a large NFA may be transformed into an equivalent DFA by a series of actions operating directly on the NFA, Subset Construction may be unnecessarily expensive in computation, as a (possibly large) deterministic portion of the NFA is regenerated as is, a waste of processing. This is why a conservative algorithm for NFA determinization is proposed, called Quick Subset Construction, which progressively transforms an NFA into an equivalent DFA instead of generating the DFA from scratch, thereby avoiding unnecessary processing. Quick Subset Construction is proven, both formally and empirically, to be equivalent to Subset Construction, inasmuch it generates exactly the same DFA. Experimental results indicate that, the smaller the number of repair actions performed on the NFA, as compared to the size of the equivalent DFA, the faster Quick Subset Construction over Subset Construction.

The rearrangement is the key-reaction in the three-step conversion of phenols into the corresponding thiophenols. The described procedure can be performed at room temperature under aerobic conditions using violet LEDs. The rearrangement has been achieved for 24 electron-rich substrates with yields up to 99 %. A plausible mechanism is proposed based on the substrate scope, spectroscopic studies, and control experiments.

Large library docking for novel SARS-CoV-2 main protease non-covalent and covalent inhibitors	PROTEIN SCIENCE			English	Article						major protease; SARS-COV-2; structure-based inhibitor; discoverydockinganti-viral	RESPIRATORY SYNDROME-CORONAVIRUS; STRUCTURE-BASED DISCOVERY; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; LIGAND DISCOVERY; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; SARS; POTENT; IDENTIFICATION; PROTEINASE; REFINEMENT	Antiviral therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2 are needed to diminish the morbidity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A well-precedented drug target is the main viral protease (M-Pro), which is targeted by an approved drug and by several investigational drugs. Emerging viral resistance has made new inhibitor chemotypes more pressing. Adopting a structure-based approach, we docked 1.2 billion non-covalent lead-like molecules and a new library of 6.5 million electrophiles against the enzyme structure. From these, 29 non-covalent and 11 covalent inhibitors were identified in 37 series, the most potent having an IC50 of 29 and 20 mu M, respectively. Several series were optimized, resulting in low micromolar inhibitors. Subsequent crystallography confirmed the docking predicted binding modes and may template further optimization. While the new chemotypes may aid further optimization of M-Pro inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, the modest success rate also reveals weaknesses in our approach for challenging targets like M-Pro versus other targets where it has been more successful, and versus other structure-based techniques against M-Pro itself.

Physical restraint use in children with mental and behavioral health emergencies in the prehospital setting	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS OPEN			English	Article						adolescent; child; emergency medical services; mental health services; physical; restraint		ObjectiveEmergency medical services (EMS) transport for mental and behavioral health (MBH) emergencies occurs frequently in children, yet little is understood regarding prehospital physical restraint use despite the potential for serious adverse events. We aim to describe restraint use prevalence and primary impressions among children with MBH emergencies. MethodsThis is a retrospective cross-sectional study of children with MBH emergencies evaluated by Alameda County (ALCO), California EMS from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2018. Patient demographics and clinical variables were collected from the EMS records including sex, age at time of encounter, year of encounter, transport destination, medication use, and primary impression(s). The primary outcome was the use of physical restraints. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the primary outcome and associated demographic and diagnostic features, as well as temporal use patterns. Sex and age were compared between restrained and non-restrained youth using chi-square analysis. ResultsOver the 7-year study period, ALCO EMS transported 9775 children with MBH emergencies. Of these transports, 1205 (12.3%) were physically restrained. Most children restrained had the primary impression of "behavioral/psychiatric crisis" (51.1%), "psychiatric crisis" (27.4%), and "behavioral-other" (12.4%) and the remaining children (9.1%) had a non-psychiatric/behavioral health primary impression. Over time, there was no statistically significant change in either number of children with MBH emergencies transported or physical restraint rate. ConclusionsMore than 1 in 8 children with MBH emergencies are being physically restrained during EMS transport. Restraint rate did not substantially change over time. Further studies to understand existing restraint rates and EMS resources available to address acute agitation in children are needed to inform quality and care enhancing initiatives.

We describe PECC role characteristics, responsibilities, barriers, and threats to the role among a national cohort. MethodsWe surveyed a sample of PECCs from all regions of the United States who participated in the Emergency Medical Services for Children PECC Workforce and Trauma Collaboratives (2021-2022). EDs were categorized by annual pediatric patient volume: low (<1800), medium (1800-4999), medium-high (5000-9999), and high (& GE;10,000). Trend tests were performed to explore the relationship between pediatric volume and PECC characteristics. ResultsAmong 187 PECCs, 114 (61.0%) responded. The majority (75.2%) identified as a nurse. There was a significant difference in median hours per week spent on PECC activities by pediatric volume ranging from a median of 2 hours (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0-2.3) for low pediatric volume to 16 hours (IQR 4.0-37.0) for high pediatric volume (P < 0.001). Most respondents reported more time was needed for PECC activities (58.4%), and desired additional training to support the role (70.8%). Most (74.6%) felt the PECC position should be paid, yet 30.7% reported the role was voluntary. The most frequently assigned responsibilities were education of staff (77.2%) and oversight of quality improvement (QI) efforts (72.8%). ConclusionCharacteristics of PECC workforce vary but PECC activities of education and QI work are common among all. There is a reported need for additional training and support. Further studies will determine the impact of PECC characteristics on pediatric readiness.	[Foster, Ashley A.

J	Frolov, A; Mashchuk, I				Frolov, Andrey; Mashchuk, Irina			Two New Species of <i>Eretmophyllum</i> (Ginkgoales) from the Jurassic of Eastern Siberia	ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						paleobotany; ginkgoalean; taxonomy; paleophytogeography; paleoecology; leaf cuticles; Irkutsk Coal Basin	BASIN	Two new species of Eretmophyllum Thomas are described from the lower (Toarcian) and upper (Aalenian) Prisayan Formation of the Irkutsk Basin, Eastern Siberia, Russia based on distinct morphological and cuticular features of the leaves that distinguish them from other species of the genus. Eretmophyllum polypapillosum sp. nov. is characterized by the presence of 2-3 papillae on the lower and upper epidermis of ordinary cells. Taphonomically, the leaf burials of E. polypapillosum sp. nov. indicate that it preferred mesophilic forests developed on river terraces and/or low watersheds. Eretmophyllum yershowskiensis sp. nov. is represented exclusively by leaf cuticles extracted by coal maceration, and it probably inhabited the low banks of peat bogs. The presence of the genus Eretmophyllum in the Early Jurassic of France and Eastern Siberia shows that it was already widespread in the territory of Eurasia, distributed from Western Europe to Eastern Siberia. This indicates the possible existence of Eretmophyllum species elsewhere in the Early Jurassic such as Central Asia and Northwest China.

Genome-wide association studies have unveiled a correlation between genetic variations in autophagy-related genes and heightened susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Subsequently, substantial progress has been made in unraveling the intricate involvement of autophagy in immunity and inflammation through functional studies. The autophagy pathway plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immunity, encompassing various key functions such as pathogen clearance, antigen processing and presentation, cytokine production, and lymphocyte differentiation and survival. Recent research has identified novel approaches in which the autophagy pathway and its associated proteins modulate the immune response, including noncanonical autophagy. This review provides an overview of the latest advancements in understanding the regulation of immunity and inflammation through autophagy. It summarizes the genetic associations between variants in autophagy-related genes and a range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, while also examining studies utilizing transgenic animal models to uncover the in vivo functions of autophagy. Furthermore, the review delves into the mechanisms by which autophagy dysregulation contributes to the development of three common autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and highlights the potential for autophagy-targeted therapies.

The main treatment underlies surgical intervention however; management should be done with patient's decision. Coronary angiography (CA) is a widely utilized diagnostic procedure used to evaluate blood flow through the coronary arteries and detect coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite its widespread use, it has complications including non-life-threatening, while there are some rare complications that can occur. We present a case of an elderly woman who presented with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent CA without evidence of CAD. However, the patient later developed type A aortic dissection (AD) as a complication of the procedure. Surgery is considered emergent treatment for type A-AD, but the patient was asymptomatic without any complaint, shared decision making was conducted and the patient decided to pursue conservative treatment without surgical intervention. Therefore, managing AD should be tailored to each patient individually through shared-decision making.

In this study, we introduced an innovative approach to quantify river bank erosion and its contribution to a reach fine sediment budget by combining repeat bank erosion surveys using a jetboat-mounted LiDAR scanner with concurrent high-frequency suspended sediment load measurements into and out of the surveyed reach. Using this information, we established a sediment budget for a 5.5-km-long study reach of the lower Oreti River, Southland, New Zealand. A total of three surveys were conducted along the study reach to understand changes in the bank erosion contribution to suspended sediment load at different time scales. The first two surveys were separated by a short period of 8 weeks, and the third survey followed 2.5 years later. The measured volumes of fine sediment rendered from bank erosion equated to 25% and 29% of the measured outflowing suspended load over these two inter-survey epochs, respectively. By comparison, the net contribution of measured bank erosion and derived fine sediment deposition on the riverbed to the outflowing suspended load was 12% over the first, shorter epoch and 25% for the second, 2.5-year epoch. These results highlight the important role of in-channel sediment deposition in the variability of net suspended sediment exports from channel reaches experiencing bank erosion. The approach used in this study has a unique capability to accurately monitor bank erosion and obtain high-resolution topography data capturing changes in river banks over different time periods.

The proposed antenna consists of a pair of rotational symmetric short-circuited branches and a & UGamma;-shaped feed structure. Each branch is designed to be axe-shaped so that the antenna can achieve a broad 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth. The coupled feeding method assures the antenna is wideband, and the shorting-to-the-ground technique miniaturizes the lateral dimensions of the antenna. The profile of the proposed antenna is around 0.16 & lambda;(L) (& lambda;(L) denotes the wavelength of the lower bound frequency). The introduction of a back cavity effectively enhances the boresight gain and improves the isolation level if the antenna is used to form an array. Finally, the design is prototyped, and the measurement results agree well with the simulation. The fractal voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)<2 bandwidth and 3-dB AR bandwidths are 61.15% (2.725-5.125 GHz) and 45.9% (3.15-5.03 GHz), respectively. The antenna's efficiency exceeds 91.5% over the target frequency band.

Remotely sensed environmental measurements detect decoupled processes driving population dynamics at contrasting scales	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						fitness; Landsat; monitoring; population dynamics	TAILED KANGAROO RAT; DIPODOMYS-SPECTABILIS; CHIHUAHUAN DESERT; RODENT COMMUNITY; PRECIPITATION; VEGETATION; TRANSFORMATION; DISPERSAL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY	The increasing availability of satellite imagery has supported a rapid expansion in forward-looking studies seeking to track and predict how climate change will influence wild population dynamics. However, these data can also be used in retrospect to provide additional context for historical data in the absence of contemporaneous environmental measurements. We used 167 Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images spanning 13 years to identify environmental drivers of fitness and population size in a well-characterized population of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis) in the southwestern United States. We found evidence of two decoupled processes that may be driving population dynamics in opposing directions over distinct time frames. Specifically, increasing mean surface temperature corresponded to increased individual fitness, where fitness is defined as the number of offspring produced by a single individual. This result contrasts with our findings for population size, where increasing surface temperature led to decreased numbers of active mounds. These relationships between surface temperature and (i) individual fitness and (ii) population size would not have been identified in the absence of remotely sensed data, indicating that such information can be used to test existing hypotheses and generate new ecological predictions regarding fitness at multiple spatial scales and degrees of sampling effort. To our knowledge, this study is the first to directly link remotely sensed environmental data to individual fitness in a nearly exhaustively sampled population, opening a new avenue for incorporating remote sensing data into eco-evolutionary studies.

Ensuring access to justice: the need for community paralegals to end AIDS by 2030	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						HIV; prevention; access to care; structural interventions; human rights; legal services	LEGAL EMPOWERMENT; STRUCTURAL INTERVENTIONS; SEX WORKERS; HEALTH; SERVICES; CARE	IntroductionThe HIV response has long recognized that certain "key populations" such as individuals in detention, adolescent girls and young women, sex workers, people who use drugs, LGBTQ individuals, migrants and others face higher barriers to access to, uptake of, and retention in HIV prevention and treatment services. One approach to addressing these barriers is the training of community paralegals to advocate for the rights of individuals and to address discrimination in health settings. DiscussionCommunity paralegal programmes have been able to successfully address rights violations that impact access to health services and underlying determinants of health across a range of countries and populations, focusing upon issues such as discrimination and the denial of health services; unlawful detention of outreach workers, sex workers, persons who use drugs and men who have sex with men; and harmful traditional practices and gender-based violence. In addition to resolving specific cases, evaluations of paralegal programmes have found that these programmes increased legal literacy among key populations at risk of HIV and increased understanding of human rights among healthcare providers, resulting in improved access to HIV services. Some evaluations have noted challenges related to the sustainability of paralegal programmes similar to those raised with community health worker programmes more broadly. ConclusionsTo achieve global HIV goals, funding for legal literacy and paralegal programmes should be increased and interventions should be rigorously evaluated. Efforts should target discrimination in access to HIV prevention and treatment and criminalization of key populations, two key barriers to ensuring access to HIV prevention and treatment services.

J	Holzknecht, F; Harding, L				Holzknecht, Franz; Harding, Luke			Repeating the Listening Text: Effects on Listener Performance, Metacognitive Strategy Use, and Anxiety	TESOL QUARTERLY			English	Article; Early Access							REPETITION; INPUT; TASK	In second language listening assessment and pedagogy, practitioners hold different views on whether to repeat a listening text in contexts where inferences about listening ability are to be drawn from task performance. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of repeating the listening text (double play) on listener performance, listening strategies, test-taking strategies, test-taking anxiety, and listening anxiety. Three hundred six Austrian secondary school students responded to four listening tasks drawn from the Austrian Matura exam and completed questionnaires measuring strategic behavior and anxiety in a counter-balanced research design. Data were analyzed using many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM), factor analysis, and inferential statistics. Findings confirmed that double play led to higher levels of listener performance across two task types (multiple-choice items and note completion), however, scores were higher in the single play condition compared to the first play of double play. Students also reported lower levels of anxiety, and the use of more listening strategies and fewer test-taking strategies in double play compared to single play with small effect sizes. We discuss the importance of balancing an empirically derived understanding of the effects of repeating the listening text with considerations of the purpose of an assessment, and the characteristics of the target language use domain.

Previous studies have shown that CATs exhibit different or even opposite effects on plant immunity in different plant-pathogen interactions, but little is known about the mechanisms. In this study, Nicotiana tabacum plants with overexpression or knockout of CAT genes, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) were employed to investigate the role of CAT in compatible plant-virus interactions. The results showed that there were dynamic changes in the effect of CAT on N. tabacum defense responses. Overexpression of catalase 1 (CAT1) and catalase 3 (CAT3) improved N. tabacum resistance in the early stage of virus infection but depressed it during the late stages of pathogenesis, especially in CAT3 overexpressing plants. The lower level of electrolyte leakage, lower contents of malonaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and improved functions of photosystem II corresponded to the milder symptoms and higher resistance of infected tobacco plants. In addition, the infection of TMV and CMV resulted in expression changes of CATs in tobacco plants, and pretreatment with H2O2 facilitated TMV and CMV infection. Further experiments showed that the content of salicylic acid (SA) and the expression of genes related to SA signaling pathway were positively correlated with plant resistance, whereas auxin and its related signaling pathway were related to the viral susceptibility of plants. Taken together, our results demonstrated that CAT1 and CAT3 mediated tobacco resistance to virus infection through crosstalk between SA and auxin signaling pathways.

Ramifications of groundwater model in WRF/Noah-MP coupled system: Effects on soil-moisture and regional climate simulation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						land-atmosphere interactions; shallow groundwater; soil moisture; WRF-NoahMP	SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL; LAND-SURFACE; DATA ASSIMILATION; INDIA; PRECIPITATION; FLOW	Soil moisture is a key variable that contributes for flux partitioning into sensible and latent heat components. There is a pressing need to study the impacts of shallow groundwater table dynamics on antecedent soil moisture and corresponding feedbacks to atmosphere. In this study, we evaluate WRF-NoahMP simulated soil moisture using two experimental configurations: one with the default, free drainage approach (CTL) and with Miguez-Macho groundwater scheme (GW). Results are presented for the study conducted over Ganga River basin, India between the years 2008 and 2014 for all the three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). It was observed that the GW model runs, improve soil moisture in topmost and bottom-most layers. We discovered that the simulations improved temporal negative bias of seasonal accumulation during monsoon by around 91 mm. In addition, the average negative bias in latent heat flux improved by around 28 W/m(2). Compared to CTL, GW was found to contribute additional atmospheric moisture content ranging between 3% and 5%. Comparison with in-situ ground water showed that model overestimates the ground water table depth. This can be attributed to the ability of the model to only simulate natural occurring variabilities and lack of inclusion of anthropogenic factors such as ground water pumping in the model. The groundwater trend in Ganga is declining at alarming rate. In addition, if over exploitation of groundwater is not monitored properly, water and food scarcity is an imminent threat to the country's economy. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to be implemented over Ganga basin, which evaluates the role of shallow ground water table on regional climate using coupled atmosphere-land surface-groundwater model. In summary, we highlight that the groundwater component along with WRF-NoahMP coupled model improves soil moisture and precipitation representation over the Ganga basin.

Stem cells is a class of primitive cells with the potentiality of differentiation, regenerate with self-replication, multidirectional differentiation, and immunomodulatory functions. Stem cells and their cytokines not only inextricably linked to the regeneration of ectodermal and skin tissues, but also can be used for the treatment of a variety of chronic wounds. Stem cells can produce exosomes in a paracrine manner. Stem cell exosomes play an important role in tissue regeneration, repair, and accelerated wound healing, the biological properties of which are similar with stem cells, while stem cell exosomes are safer and more effective. Skin and bone tissues are critical organs in the body, which are essential for sustaining life activities. The weak repairing ability leads a pronounced impact on the quality of life of patients, which could be alleviated by stem cell exosomes treatment. However, there are obstacles that stem cells and stem cells exosomes trough skin for improved bioavailability. This paper summarizes the applications and mechanisms of stem cells and stem cells exosomes for skin and bone healing. We also propose new ways of utilizing stem cells and their exosomes through different nanoformulations, liposomes and nanoliposomes, polymer micelles, microspheres, hydrogels, and scaffold microneedles, to improve their use in tissue healing and regeneration.

Accurate sizing and quantification of EVs remain problematic, given their nanometre size range and small scattering cross-sections. This is compounded by the fact that common EV isolation methods result in co-isolation of particles with comparable features. Especially in blood plasma, similarly-sized lipoproteins outnumber EVs to a great extent. Recently, interferometric nanoparticle tracking analysis (iNTA) was introduced as a particle analysis method that enables determining the size and refractive index of nanoparticles with high sensitivity and precision. In this work, we apply iNTA to differentiate between EVs and lipoproteins, and compare its performance to conventional nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). We show that iNTA can accurately quantify EVs in artificial EV-lipoprotein mixtures and in plasma-derived EV samples of varying complexity. Conventional NTA could not report on EV numbers, as it was not able to distinguish EVs from lipoproteins. iNTA has the potential to become a new standard for label-free EV characterization in suspension.

The diagnosis of canine Langerhans cell histiocytosis has been proposed in the veterinary literature to refer to a histiocytic proliferative disease in the dog with clinical and histopathologic features that mirror the human disease. However, reports that invoke this diagnosis are rare and often lack complete diagnostic characterization. This case report presents an extensive diagnostic investigation of a putative case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis in a 3-year-old male castrated Golden Retriever dog, including gross, cytologic, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical findings. Furthermore, we document that canine LCH may have positive immunolabeling for the transcription factor multiple myeloma oncogene 1/interferon regulatory factor 4 (MUM1/IRF4), which is classically used for the diagnosis of canine plasma cell neoplasms.

AEM EDUCATION AND TRAINING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Research Forum	OCT, 2021	Boston, MA			nutrition; residency training; well-being; wellness	WELLNESS	BackgroundRelatively little data describe how diet and food choices impact trainee well-being despite evidence that diet impacts both physical and mental health. The objective was to describe food options available to emergency medicine (EM) residents when on duty. MethodsA survey utilizing closed-ended, binary, rank-order responses was developed by experts in graduate medical education and wellness; it was piloted, revised, and then electronically distributed to 211 EM residency programs over 2 weeks in 2021. The program director (PD) or associate PD was invited to participate. ResultsA total of 114 EM programs participated (54%). The primary teaching site included 43 community hospitals, 23 county hospitals, and 48 university hospitals. Resident access to an onsite hospital cafeteria was most common (97%); other onsite options were vending machines (87%), fresh food fridges (34%), national chains (32%), local restaurants (25%), food trucks (30%), and farmer's markets (11%). More than one-third (38%) reported that onsite options did not include healthy food, 26% reported being dissatisfied with onsite food, and 35% rarely or never purchased food onsite. Most programs (89%) do not have a dedicated "meal break" for residents while on duty. Few residency programs include diet or nutrition classes or counseling. When programs sponsor meals during residency events, nutritional value and dietary considerations were ranked less important than cost of food and convenience. ConclusionsAccess to healthy food options is not always available during scheduled resident work hours, and dedicated meal breaks are infrequent. These data should inform institutional initiatives to improve the health and well-being of resident physicians.

However, the functions and mechanisms of N are not fully established for shaded rapeseed plants. Therefore, we conducted a 2-year field experiment to study the effect of N on pod wall morphology and carbon metabolism of shaded rapeseed. Two varieties, three N rates (120 [N1], 240 [N2], and 360 [N3] kg hm(-2)) and two light intensities (100 and 70% light transmission) from 10 to 35 days after the end of flowering were set as experimental parameters. Shading decreased the pod wall chlorophyll content, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activity and glucose content at 25 and 35 days after flowering (DAF). Decreased sucrose synthase (SuSy) and sucrose phosphate synthase activity caused by shading reduced sucrose and fructose content. They are responsible for the decline in the 1000-seed weight and a 22.1-37.6% decline in seed yield. More N under shading promoted pod elongation and pigment content, improved chloroplast ultrastructure, increased Rubisco and SuSy activity at 35 DAF, thus contributing to pod wall photosynthesis and fructose and glucose levels in shaded rapeseed plants. Similar trends were observed in pod number, pod weight, and seed weight, while the greatest increase in seed/wall ratio was observed under N2 for shaded rapeseed plants. The results indicated that N can reduce the yield difference between different light conditions and balance partitioning and conversion of photoassimilates in pod wall, but avoid applying an excessive amount of nitrogen.

Also, to propose strategies to promote supportive palliative care in the rural communities of Indiana, USA. MethodWe conducted qualitative interviews to gather rural caregivers' experiences of palliative care. Recruitment was done in collaboration with community partners using social media, flyers, emails, invitations, and word-of-mouth. A purposive sample of family caregivers was obtained. All the interviews were conducted online. The average interview was 30-45 minutes. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. FindingsOur findings showed 6 major themes that indicated several palliative care needs and preferences of older patients and their families in rural communities that include: (1) difficulties in pain and symptom burden; (2) perceived discrimination and lack of trust; (3) longer distances to care facilities; (4) difficult conversations; (5) caregiving burden; and (6) use of telehealth in a rural palliative care context. ConclusionRural family caregivers experience several social inequities and disparities causing a lack of access to and low utilization of palliative care. All these disparities cause several challenges for patients and their families trying to manage serious illnesses and die in place with peace and comfort. Inadequate access and lack of resources cause pain and distress for both patients and their families. Provider education and trainings, initiating early palliative care models, integrating behavioral health in palliative care, and using culturally congruent care delivery approaches in support of community partners can improve palliative care services in rural communities.

In species with DUI (similar to 100 known bivalves), both sexes transmit their mitochondria: males bear both a male- and female-type mitogenome, while females bear only the female type. Male and female mitotypes are sufficiently divergent to reliably PCR-amplify them specifically. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a precise, economical and portable alternative to PCR for molecular sexing and we demonstrate its application in this context. We used 154 individuals sampled along the Atlantic coast of France and sexed microscopically by gonad examination to test for the congruence among gamete type, PCR sexing and LAMP sexing. We show an exact match among the sexing results from these three methods using the male and female mt-cox1 genes. DUI can be disrupted in inter-specific hybrids, causing unexpected distribution of mitogenomes, such as homoplasmic males or heteroplasmic females. To our knowledge, DUI disruption at the intra-specific scale has never been tested. We applied our sexing protocol to control for unexpected heteroplasmy caused by hybridization between divergent genetic lineages and found no evidence of disruption in the mode of mitochondrial inheritance in M. balthica rubra. We propose LAMP as a useful tool to accelerate eco-evolutionary studies of DUI. It offers the opportunity to investigate the potential role of, previously unaccounted-for, sex-specific patterns such as sexual selection or sex-specific dispersal bias in the evolution of free-spawning benthic species.

The intestinal mucosa is the primary exposure route of food allergens. However, no study has examined intestinal metabolites associated with FA persistence. The goal of this study was to investigate intestinal metabolites and associated microbiomes in early life that aid in determining the development and persistence of FA. MethodsWe identified metabolomic alterations in the stool of infants according to FA by mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolome profiling. The targeted metabolomic analysis of bile acid metabolites and stool microbiome was performed. Bile acid metabolite composition in infancy was evaluated by characterizing the subjects at the age of 3 into FA remission and persistent FA. ResultsIn untargeted metabolomics, primary bile acid biosynthesis was significantly different between subjects with FA and healthy controls. In targeted metabolomics for bile acids, intestinal bile acid metabolites synthesized by the alternative pathway were reduced in infants with FA than those in healthy controls. Subjects with persistent FA were also distinguished from healthy controls and those with FA remission by bile acid metabolites of the alternative pathway. These metabolites were negatively correlated with specific IgE levels in egg white. The abundance of intestinal Clostridia was decreased in the FA group and was correlated with ursodeoxycholic acid. ConclusionIntestinal bile acid metabolites of the alternative pathway could be predictive biomarkers for persistent FA in early childhood. These findings require replication in future studies.

Research on the rehabilitation of numerical transcoding remains scarce in the literature and, despite positive results, presents a low level of evidence. AimsThe present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted rehabilitation of numerical transcoding in two patients suffering from a chronic secondary acalculia. Methods & ProceduresTwo post-brain injury females with secondary acalculia took part in a single-case experimental design with multiple baseline across subjects according to a three-phase experimental protocol: baseline involving global cognitive rehabilitation (5-7 measurements with randomized sequential introduction); targeted intervention (10 measurements); follow-up (2 immediate measurements and 1 month after the end of the intervention). Repeated outcome measures consisted of six lists composed of numbers of equivalent difficulty that were used alternately to assess numerical transcoding. We used a reverse digit span as a control measure to assess the specificity of the intervention. Rehabilitation lasted 5 weeks and consisted of errorless learning with colour cues, tables and number-words cards. Outcomes & ResultsDuring baseline period involving global cognitive rehabilitation, transcoding scores remained unchanged. In contrast, there was a significant improvement in scores for both patients during the intervention phase targeting transcoding and maintenance of benefits 1-month post-intervention. Conclusions & ImplicationsThis study demonstrates that a specific rehabilitation targeting numerical transcoding following chronic secondary acalculia can be effective in improving transcoding skills. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSWhat is already known on the subjectTranscoding difficulties in patients with acalculia can cause a significant disability in everyday life activities. In secondary acalculia, rehabilitation of cognitive functions associated with number processing (attention, working memory, language) is not sufficient for improvement of transcoding. What this paper adds to existing knowledgeAn intervention specifically targeting numerical transcoding significantly and durably improves the skills of patients with chronic secondary acalculia. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?Procedural error-free intervention using colour cueing, tables, cards with number-words, copy and repetition seems effective to improve transcoding skills in chronic acalculia.

Autonomous sensors, such as acoustic recorders, can aid monitoring across long time scales. This project successfully developed, tested and implemented call recognisers for eight species of frog in the Murray-Darling Basin. Recognisers for all but one species performed well and substantially better than many species recognisers reported in the literature. We achieved this through a comprehensive development phase, which carefully considered and refined the representativeness of training data, as well as the construction (amplitude cut-off) and the similarity thresholds (score cut-offs) of each call template used. Recogniser performance was high for almost all species examined. Recognisers for Crinia signifera, Limnodynastes fletcherii, Limnodynastes dumerilii, Litoria peronii and Crinia parinsignifera all performed well, with most templates having receiver operating characteristics values (the proportion of true positive and true negatives) over 0.7, and some much higher. Recognisers for L. peronii, L. fletcherii and L. dumerilii performed particularly well in the training data set, which allowed for responses to environmental watering events, a restoration activity, to be clearly observed. While slightly more involved than building recognisers using commercial packages, the workflows ensure that a high-quality recogniser can be built and the performance fine-tuned using multiple parameters. Using the same framework, recognisers can be improved on in future iterations. We believe that multi-species recognisers are a highly effective and precise way to detect the effects of ecosystem restoration.

Excess iron can catalyze the generation of free radicals through Fenton reactions due to its dual redox state, thus causing oxidative stress. Numerous evidence has indicated brain diseases, especially stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, are closely related to the mechanism of iron homeostasis imbalance in the brain. For one thing, brain diseases promote brain iron accumulation. For another, iron accumulation amplifies damage to the nervous system and exacerbates patients' outcomes. In addition, iron accumulation triggers ferroptosis, a newly discovered iron-dependent type of programmed cell death, which is closely related to neurodegeneration and has received wide attention in recent years. In this context, we outline the mechanism of a normal brain iron metabolism and focus on the current mechanism of the iron homeostasis imbalance in stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Meanwhile, we also discuss the mechanism of ferroptosis and simultaneously enumerate the newly discovered drugs for iron chelators and ferroptosis inhibitors.

All participants read the same articles, with discussions guided by the same reading questions. Participants' dialogs in both conditions were coded based on types of discursive moves, then analyzed through a framework of social, textual, and linguistic affordances. Findings revealed that social affordances emerged significantly more frequently than other affordances among FTF groups while textual affordances emerged significantly more frequently than other affordances among DSAR groups. Findings support the benefits of DSAR tools for more anchored discussions over traditional FTF classroom discussions, with the caution that DSAR tools alone do not necessarily promote deep discussion of foreign language texts. Beyond pedagogical implications, this study suggests an expansion of theoretical frameworks of affordances in future DSAR research.

The purpose of this study was to define the role and mechanism of spinal 5-HT release induced by oral morphine. We also examined whether persistent pain affected the spinal 5-HT release induced by oral morphine. Spinal 5-HT release was measured using microdialysis of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Two opioids, morphine and oxycodone, were orally administered and 5-HT release was measured in awake rats. Naloxone and & beta;-funaltrexamine (& beta;-FNA) were used to determine whether the effect of morphine on 5-HT release was mediated by opioid receptor activation. To study persistent pain, a formalin test was used. At 45 min after oral morphine administration, the formalin test was started and spinal 5-HT release was measured. Oral morphine, but not oral oxycodone, increased 5-HT release at the spinal cord to approximately 4000% of the baseline value. This effect of morphine was not antagonized by either naloxone or & beta;-FNA at a dose that antagonized the antinociceptive effect of morphine. Formalin-induced persistent pain itself had no effect on spinal 5-HT release but enhanced the oral morphine-induced spinal 5-HT release. Oral morphine-induced spinal 5-HT release was not mediated by opioid receptor activation. Spinal 5-HT induced by oral morphine did not play a major role in the antinociceptive effect of morphine in the hot plate test. Persistent pain increased oral morphine-induced spinal 5-HT release.

However, many are hesitant to do so lest they make missteps, promises they cannot keep, appear inauthentic, or alienate consumers, employees, or other stakeholders. Here we investigate consumers' impressions of firms that respond quickly or slowly to sociopolitical events. Using data scraped from Instagram and three online experiments (N = 2452), we find that consumers express more positive sentiment and greater purchasing intentions toward firms that react more quickly to sociopolitical issues. Unlike other types of public firm decision making such as product launch, where careful deliberation can be appreciated, consumers treat firm response time to sociopolitical events as an informative cue of the firm's authentic commitment to the issue. We identify an important boundary condition of this main effect: speedy responses bring limited benefits when the issue is highly divisive along political lines. Our findings bridge extant research on brand activism and communication, and offer practical advice for firms.

J	Nangaku, M				Nangaku, Masaomi			Global perspective of kidney diseases: Challenges and changes	NEPHROLOGY			English	Article						CKD; end-stage kidney disease; kidney failure		Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue worldwide. Although strategies for prevention, early detection and treatment to reduce the progression of CKD should remain continuous endeavours, public funding for kidney replacement therapy is urgently needed in low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). A multisectoral approach is needed to tackle the global burden of kidney disease. Getting a new drug, from first testing to final approval by a regulatory agency and ultimately to market, is a long, costly and risky process. While clinical trials and research have delivered new therapies and devices to patients with kidney disease during the last decade, there remains a significant residual risk for patients with CKD. Therefore, developing new drugs for better treatment and patient care is essential. For this purpose, the ISN held a consensus meeting entitled 'TRANSFORM; TRAnslational Nephrology Science FOR new Medications', which connected experts in the global kidney community and provided guidance on optimal management of translational animal studies for the development of new drugs to treat kidney diseases.

IKZF1 acts principally as a tumour suppressor via transcriptional repression of oncogenes in normal lymphoid lineages. In contrast, IKZF1 activates IRF4 and other oncogenes in MM cells, suggesting the involvement of unknown co-factors in switching the IKZF1 complex from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. The transactivating components of the IKZF1 complex might promote lenalidomide resistance by residing on regulatory regions of the IRF4 gene to maintain its transcription after IKZF1 degradation. MethodsTo identify unknown components of the IKZF1 complex, we analyzed the genome-wide binding of IKZF1 in MM cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) and screened for the co-occupancy of IKZF1 with other DNA-binding factors on the myeloma genome using the ChIP-Atlas platform. ResultsWe found that c-FOS, a member of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family, is an integral component of the IKZF1 complex and is primarily responsible for the activator function of the complex in MM cells. The genome-wide screening revealed the co-occupancy of c-FOS with IKZF1 on the regulatory regions of IKZF1-target genes, including IRF4 and SLAMF7, in MM cells but not normal bone marrow progenitors, pre-B cells or mature T-lymphocytes. c-FOS and IKZF1 bound to the same consensus sequence as the IKZF1 complex through direct protein-protein interactions. The complex also includes c-JUN and IKZF3 but not IRF4. Treatment of MM cells with short-hairpin RNA against FOS or a selective AP-1 inhibitor significantly enhanced the anti-MM activity of lenalidomide in vitro and in two murine MM models. Furthermore, an AP-1 inhibitor mitigated the lenalidomide resistance of MM cells. ConclusionsC-FOS determines lenalidomide sensitivity and mediates drug resistance in MM cells as a co-factor of IKZF1 and thus, could be a novel therapeutic target for further improvement of the prognosis of MM patients.

The aim of this paper was to combine first- and third-person approaches to investigate whether the strategies individuals use during a working memory task are associated with specific task conditions, whether the strategies combine to form stable patterns, and whether the use of specific strategies is related to task accuracy. Thirty-one participants took part in an experiment in which they were instructed to remember colors, orientations, or positions of stimuli presented in a change detection task. After every 7th-15th trial, participants took part in an in-depth phenomenological interview in which they described their experiences during the trial that immediately preceded the interview. Qualitative analysis revealed a set of 18 strategies that participants used while performing the task, which we divided into active and passive strategies of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Quantitative analysis revealed that while many strategies were used in all task conditions, some strategies and their combinations may be better suited to the specific task demands, while others are more general in nature. The results also suggest a distinction between strategies for encoding object identity and spatial features. Finally, our results did not provide robust evidence for a relationship between specific strategies and task accuracy.

Bison alter the northern Yellowstone ecosystem by breaking aspen saplings	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						aspen; bison; conservation conflicts; ecological engineer; trophic cascade; Yellowstone National Park	POPULUS-TREMULOIDES; TROPHIC CASCADES; NATIONAL-PARK; PREHISTORIC BISON; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; ELK; PLANT; FIRE; DISTURBANCE; COMMUNITY	The American bison (Bison bison) is a species that strongly interacts with its environment, yet the effects of this large herbivore on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) have received little study. We documented bison breaking the stems of aspen saplings (young aspen >2 m tall and =5 cm in diameter at breast height) and examined the extent of this effect in northern Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Low densities of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) after about 2004 created conditions conducive for new aspen recruitment in YNP's northern ungulate winter range (northern range). We sampled aspen saplings at local and landscape scales, using random sampling plots in 87 randomly selected aspen stands. Across the YNP northern range, we found that 18% of sapling stems had been broken. The causal attribution to bison was supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) most broken saplings were in areas of high bison and low elk density; (2) saplings were broken in summer when elk were not foraging on them; (3) we directly observed bison breaking aspen saplings; and (4) mixed-effects modeling showed a positive association between scat density of bison and the proportion of saplings broken. In a stand heavily used by bison, most aspen saplings had been broken, and portions of the stand were cleared of saplings that were present in previous sampling in 2012. Bison numbers increased more than fourfold between 2004 and 2015, and their ecosystem effects have similarly increased, limiting and in some places reversing the nascent aspen recovery. This situation is further complicated by political constraints that prevent bison from dispersing to areas outside the park. Thus, one important conservation goal, the preservation of bison, is affecting another long-term conservation goal, the recovery of aspen and other deciduous woody species in northern Yellowstone.

MethodsA random sample of adults, representative of the general population living in Finland, participated in a nationwide health examination study. For 4387 participants aged 18-97 years, we analyzed, after controlling for confounding factors, whether cynical hostility, as assessed with the 8-item Cook-Medley Hostility Scale, or sense of coherence, as assessed with the 13-item Sense of Coherence Scale, contributed to current suicidal thoughts during the past 7 days as scored on the 25-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist. ResultsSuicidal thoughts (current thoughts of ending one's life) were associated significantly with cynical hostility (p < 0.001) as well as with sense of coherence (p < 0.001). Of the specific items of cynical hostility, the item "I am sure that most people do not have problems with lying for their own good" was associated most strongly with current suicidal thoughts (p < 0.001). ConclusionCynical hostility predicted current suicidal thoughts in a population-based sample of adults aged 18-97 years. Sense of coherence protected from current suicidal thoughts.

J	Prieto-Ramírez, AM				Prieto-Ramirez, Ana Maria			Effects of landscape structure and patch characteristics on the density of central populations of the eastern green lizard <i>Lacerta viridis</i>	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						habitat loss; landscape structure; lizards; population density; scale of effect	THERMAL BIOLOGY; TROPICAL FOREST; HABITAT; REPTILES; ABUNDANCE; FRAGMENTATION; OCCUPANCY; AMPHIBIANS; RESPONSES; CLIMATE	A better understanding of the impact of habitat loss on population density can be achieved by evaluating effects of both parameters within remnant habitat patches and parameters of the landscape surrounding those patches. The integration of predictors at the patch and landscape level is scarce in animal ecological studies, especially for reptiles. In this study, a patch-landscape approach was applied to evaluate the combined effects of within-patch habitat quality, patch geometry and landscape configuration and composition on the density of remnant populations of the eastern green lizard, Lacerta viridis, in a highly modified landscape in Bulgaria. Landscape composition variables (proportion of different land covers) were measured at different spatial scales surrounding patches. Single-scale models were built to evaluate combined effects of all predictors on density, when including all landscape composition variables at a specific spatial scale. Multi-scale models were applied to analyze combined effects when including landscape composition variables at the scale of their strongest effect (scale of effect, SoE). Results showed that the SoE of proportion of cropland and urban areas was small (50 m), while for proportion of habitat was large (1.5 km). The overall effect of habitat loss was better explained by the multi-scale model. Population density increased with patch area and decreased with patch shape irregularity and with the proportion of three land cover types surrounding patches-cropland, urban areas, and habitat. Combining patch and landscape parameters is important to identify ecological processes that occur simultaneously at different spatial levels and landscape scales, which would imply the application of multi-scale approaches for the protection of wild animal populations. Results are contrasted with what is known about occupancy patterns of the species in the same region and approaches to integrate both occupancy and density, in the field design of animal ecological studies are suggested.

Effects of drought, disturbance, and biotic neighborhood on experimental tree seedling performance	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						conspecific inhibition; conspecific negative density dependence; forest biodiversity; interannual variation; tree species coexistence	NEGATIVE DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; PLANT-SOIL FEEDBACKS; LATITUDINAL GRADIENT; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; TROPICAL FOREST; RAIN-FOREST; CANOPY GAPS; MORTALITY; COEXISTENCE; TEMPERATE	Forest biodiversity is likely maintained by a complex suite of interacting drivers that vary in importance across both space and time. Contributing factors include disturbance, interannual variation in abiotic variables, and biotic neighborhood effects. To probe ongoing uncertainties and potential interactions, we investigated tree seedling performance in a temperate mid-Atlantic forest ecosystem. We planted seedlings of five native tree species in mapped study plots, half of which were subjected to disturbance, and then monitored seedling survival, height growth, and foliar condition. The final year of data collection encompassed a drought, enabling comparison between intervals varying in water availability. Seedling performance was analyzed as a function of canopy cover and biotic neighborhood (conspecific and heterospecific abundance), including interactions, with separate generalized linear mixed models fit for each interval. All species exhibited: (a) pronounced declines in height growth during the drought year, (b) detrimental effects of adult conspecifics, and (c) beneficial effects of canopy openness. However, despite these consistencies, there was considerable variation across species in terms of the relevant predictors for each response variable in each interval. Our results suggest that drought may strengthen or reveal conspecific inhibition in some instances while weakening it or obscuring it in others, and that some forms of conspecific inhibition may manifest only under particular canopy conditions (although given the inconsistency of our findings, we are not convinced that conspecific inhibition is critical for diversity maintenance in our study system). Overall, our work reveals a complex forest ecosystem that appears simultaneously and interactively governed by biotic neighborhood structure (e.g., conspecific and/or heterospecific abundance), local habitat conditions (e.g., canopy cover), and interannual variability (e.g., drought).

Dire wolf (<i>Canis dirus</i>) from the late Pleistocene of southern Canada (Medicine Hat, Alberta)	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE			English	Article						allometry; Canada; Canis dirus; dire wolf; geometric morphometrics; Pleistocene	FOSSIL; EXTINCTIONS; DYNAMICS; RECORDS	The dire wolf (Canis dirus) had a broad geographic range in Pleistocene North and South America. Its northernmost occurrence has been reported from late Pleistocene deposits in Medicine Hat, Alberta, representing the only record of the taxon in Canada. However, the dentary upon which these reports were based has never been described or illustrated. The Medicine Hat specimen is badly crushed and appears to be from an old individual, which precludes the observation of adult diagnostic morphological characters. Geometric morphometrics were used to test the previous identification of the Medicine Hat dentary. A landmark-based principal component analysis and a canonical variates analysis suggests that the specimen more strongly resembles dire wolf specimens than grey wolf (Canis lupus). Identification of the Medicine Hat specimen as C. dirus supports it as the northernmost occurrence of this species in North America. However, we note the potential for allometric relationships that may confound differentiation between grey and dire wolves based on the morphology of the dentary. This study concludes by identifying future work needed in the areas of canid allometry and the biogeography of late Pleistocene North America and Beringia.

Additionally, patients with SCAD are frequently young and relatively healthy; factors that may inadvertently lower clinical suspicion of serious pathology, thereby causing delayed or missed diagnosis and inadequate management. Our case report describes a young female who presents after cardiac arrest with inconclusive initial labs and diagnostic tests who was ultimately diagnosed with SCAD. Additionally, we briefly review the pathogenesis and risk factors, as well as the diagnostic and management recommendations for SCAD.

N-acetyl-L-cysteine polysulfide with 2 sulfane sulfur atoms (NAC-S2) regulates diverse toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. Here, we aimed to determine the role of NAC-S2 in periodontitis and explore the potential mechanism. Methods: A periodontitis mouse model was established by ligating the subgingival between the first and second molars in wild-type, TLR4(-/-), and Myd88(-/-) mice. Results: NAC-S2 did not affect the proportion of macrophages (CD11b(+)F4/80(+)) or neutrophils (CD11b(+)GR-1(+)) in the bone marrow. Mechanically, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Zymosan A, or poly I: C induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1 beta expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) could be inhibited by NAC-S2. On the other hand, NAC-S2 suppressed the phosphorylation levels of I kappa B-alpha, p65, and I kappa B kinase (IKK)-beta induced by LPS in BMDMs, while LPS induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) could not be affected by NAC-S2. In wild-type periodontitis mice, NAC-S2 administration decreased the cementoenamel-junction-alveolar bone crest (CEJ-ABC) distance and the relative mRNA expression of TNF, IL-6, and IL-1 beta, while such phenomena could not be observed in TLR4 deficiency or Myd88 deficiency mice. Conclusions: All of these results indicate that NAC-S2 ameliorates TLR4/NF.B pathway mediated inflammation in mouse periodontitis model.

J	Toriumi, T; Ohmori, H; Nagasaki, Y				Toriumi, Takuto; Ohmori, Hajime; Nagasaki, Yukio			Design of Antioxidant Nanoparticle, which Selectively Locates and Scavenges Reactive Oxygen Species in the Gastrointestinal Tract, Increasing The Running Time of Mice	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome; high-intensity running; leaky gut; polymeric nanoparticle antioxidants; reactive oxygen species	INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; INDUCED MUSCLE DAMAGE; REDOX NANOPARTICLES; GUT-MICROBIOTA; EXERCISE; SUPPLEMENTATION; LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; MECHANISMS; COLITIS; MUCOSA	Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during strong or unfamiliar exercise cause exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome (EIGS), leading to poor health and decreased exercise performance. The application of conventional antioxidants can neither ameliorate EIGS nor improve exercise performance because of their rapid elimination and severe side effects on the mitochondria. Hence, a self-assembling nanoparticle-type antioxidant (RNPO) that is selectively located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract for an extended time after oral administration is developed. Interestingly, orally administered RNPO significantly enhances the running time until exhaustion in mice with increasing dosage, whereas conventional antioxidants (TEMPOL) tends to reduce the running time with increasing dosage. The running (control) and TEMPOL groups show severe damage in the GI tract and increased plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels after 80 min of running, resulting in fewer red blood cells (RBCs) and severe damage to the skeletal muscles and liver. However, the RNPO group is protected against GI tract damage and elevation of plasma LPS levels, similar to the nonrunning (sedentary) group, which prevents damage to the whole body, unlike in the control and TEMPOL groups. Based on these results, it is concluded that continuous scavenging of excessive intestinal ROS protects against gut damage and further improves exercise performance.

In many cases, the embolism is irreversible and, therefore, can potentially affect post-drought recovery and tree function under recurring droughts. We examined the development of embolism in potted Aleppo pines, a common species in hot, dry Mediterranean habitats. We asked (1) how post-drought recovery is affected by different levels of embolism and (2) what consequences this drought-induced damage has under a recurring drought scenario. Young trees were dehydrated to target water potential (Psi(x) ) values of -3.5, -5.2 and -9.5 MPa (which corresponded to similar to 6%, similar to 41% and similar to 76% embolism), and recovery of the surviving trees was measured over an 8-months period (i.e., embolism, leaf gas-exchange, Psi(x) ). An additional group of trees was exposed to Psi(x) of -6.0 MPa, either with or without preceding drought (Psi(x) of -5.2 MPa) to test the effect of hydraulic damage during repeated drought. Trees that reached -9.5 MPa died, but none from the other groups. Embolism levels in dying trees were on average 76% of conductive xylem and no tree was dying below 62% embolism. Stomatal recovery was negatively proportional to the level of hydraulic damage sustained during drought, for at least a month after drought relief. Trees that experienced drought for the second time took longer to reach fatal Psi(x) levels than first-time dehydrating trees. Decreased stomatal conductance following drought can be seen as "drought legacy," impeding recovery of tree functioning, but also as a safety mechanism during a consecutive drought.

Neuromorphic computing mimics the brain's low-power and high-speed computations, making it crucial in the era of big data and artificial intelligence. One significant development in this field is the memristor, a device that exhibits neuromorphic tendencies. The performance of memristive devices and circuits relies on the materials used, with graphene being a promising candidate due to its unique properties. Researchers are investigating graphene-based memristors for large-scale, sustainable fabrication. Herein, progress in the development of graphene-based memristive neuromorphic devices and circuits is highlighted. Graphene and its common fabrication methods are discussed. The fabrication and production of graphene-based memristive devices are reviewed and comparisons are provided among graphene- and nongraphene-based memristive devices. Next, a detailed synthesis of the devices utilizing graphene-based memristors is provided to implement the basic building blocks of neuromorphic architectures, that is, synapses, and neurons. This is followed by reviewing studies building graphene memristive spiking neural networks (SNNs). Finally, insights on the prospects of graphene-based neuromorphic memristive systems including their device- and network-level challenges and opportunities are given.

T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 4 (TIMD4) is a recognition receptor protein for efferocytosis that has been implicated in atherosclerosis mouse models. However, the role of serum-soluble TIMD4 (sTIMD4) in coronary heart disease (CHD) remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed serum samples collected from two groups: Group 1 (36 healthy controls and 70 CHD patients) and Group 2 (44 chronic coronary syndrome [CCS]) and 81 acute coronary syndrome [ACS] patients). We found that sTIMD4 levels in patients with CHD were significantly higher than those in healthy controls and were also higher in ACS than in CCS patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.787. Furthermore, our in vitro results showed that low-density lipoprotein/lipopolysaccharide activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which in turn enhanced a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, resulting in increased secretion of sTIMD4. This impairment of macrophage efferocytosis promoted inflammation. Thus, this study is not only the first identification of a potential novel biomarker of CHD, sTIMD4, but also demonstrated its pathogenesis mechanism, providing a new direction for the diagnosis and treatment of CHD.

Aiming at the problems of low precision, long time, and strongly nonlinear system estimation of state of charge and state of energy of lithium-ion batteries based on traditional algorithm under complex working conditions, this paper proposes a hybrid method consisting of the long short-term memory neural network and square root extended Kalman smoothing. The long short-term memory neural network can enhance the memory ability of the previous time data. The sliding window technology is introduced into the network to improve the correlation between the last time and the subsequent time estimation. Based on the traditional Kalman filtering algorithm, the square root and reverse smoothing algorithms are introduced to solve the risk of the negative covariance matrix and the problems of slow convergence and significant estimation deviation caused by a strongly nonlinear system. According to experiments, under the hybrid pulse power characterization working condition at 25 & DEG;C, the maximum absolute errors of state of charge and state of energy are 1.779% and 1.487%, and the mean absolute errors are 0.352% and 0.894%, respectively. Under the Beijing bus dynamic stress test working condition at 25 & DEG;C, the maximum absolute errors of state of charge and state of energy are 2.703% and 2.369%, and the mean absolute errors are 0.462% and 0.621%, respectively. The experimental results show that this algorithm can obtain reliable state of charge and state of energy under different complex working conditions with high accuracy, convergence, and robustness.

Two key tripeptide segments were synthesized using a linear peptide elongation process that includes the direct coupling of a poorly nucleophilic piperazic acid derivative. The resulting tripeptides were coupled using triphosgene/collidine at ambient temperature leading to a precursor for the final cyclization step. T3P-promoted macrolactamization under high-dilution conditions, followed by the removal of the benzyl protecting group was used to furnish two putative structures of pargamicin A. Comparison of the H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra and the antibacterial activity of the natural and synthetic products successfully revealed that the absolute configuration of the N-hydroxy-Ile residue of pargamicin A is 2S,3S. A biological evaluation of synthetically obtained pargamicin A and its diastereomer suggested that the stereostructure of the cyclic peptide scaffold of the natural product plays a crucial role in determining the strength of its antibacterial activity.

The major concern is the host toxicity resulting from their poor selectivity. Inducible PROTACs responding to exogenous stimulus, such as light, improve their specificity, but it is difficult for photo-activation in deep tissues. Herein, we develop H2O2-inducible PROTAC precursors 2/5, which can be activated by endogenous H2O2 in cancer cells to release the active PROTACs 1/4 to effectively degrade targeted proteins. This results in the intended cytotoxicity towards cancer cells while targeted protein in normal cells remains almost unaffected. The higher Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) degradation activity and cytotoxicity of 2 towards cancer cells is mainly due to the higher endogenous concentration of H2O2 in cancer cells (A549 and H1299), characterized by H2O2-responsive fluorescence probe 3. Western blot assays and cytotoxicity experiments demonstrate that 2 degrades BRD4 more effectively and is more cytotoxic in H2O2-rich cancer cells than in H2O2-deficient normal cells. This method is also extended to estrogen receptor (ER)-PROTAC precursor 5, showing H2O2-dependent ER degradation ability. Thus, we establish a novel strategy to induce targeted protein degradation in a H2O2-dependent way, which has the potential to improve the selectivity of PROTACs.

We performed long-read RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative proteome on osteosarcoma and the adjacent normal tissues, next-generation sequencing (NGS) on paired osteosarcoma samples before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), and high-throughput drug combination screen on osteosarcoma cell lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed to reveal the heterogeneity of potential therapeutic target genes. Additionally, we clarified the synergistic mechanisms of doxorubicin (DOX) and HDACs inhibitors for osteosarcoma treatment. Consequently, we identified 2535 osteosarcoma-specific genes and several alternative splicing (AS) events with osteosarcoma specificity and/or patient heterogeneity. Hundreds of potential therapeutic targets were identified among them, which showed the core regulatory roles in osteosarcoma. We also identified 215 inhibitory drugs and 236 synergistic drug combinations for osteosarcoma treatment. More interestingly, the multiomic analysis pointed out the pivotal role of HDAC1 and TOP2A in osteosarcoma. HDAC inhibitors synergized with DOX to suppress osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HDAC inhibitors synergized with DOX by downregulating SP1 to transcriptionally modulate TOP2A expression. This study provided a comprehensive view of molecular features, therapeutic targets, and synergistic drug combinations for osteosarcoma.

So far, the HK gene family has not been investigated in Gossypium. In this study, a total of 177 HK gene family members were identified in cotton. They were further divided into seven groups, and the protein characteristics, genetic relationship, gene structure, chromosome location, collinearity, and cis-elements identification were comprehensively analyzed. Whole genome duplication (WGD) / segmental duplication may be the reason why the number of HK genes doubled in tetraploid Gossypium species. Expression analysis revealed that most cotton HK genes were mainly expressed in the reproductive organs and the fiber at initial stage. Gene expression analysis revealed that HK family genes are involved in cotton abiotic stress, especially drought stress and salt stress. In addition, gene interaction networks showed that HKs were involved in the regulation of cotton abiotic stress, especially drought stress. VIGS experiments have shown that GhHK8 is a negative regulatory factor in response to drought stress. Our systematic analysis provided insights into the characteristics of the HK genes in cotton and laid a foundation for further exploring their potential in drought stress resistance in cotton.

However, human activities and climate change have severely affected habitat, population dynamics and sustainable use of Phellodendron. Little is known about the geographical distribution pattern and their responses to climate change of Phellodendron. In order to reveal the impact of climate change on Phellodendron, we conducted a study based on natural distribution data of two species (297 occurrence points), 20 environmental factors, and an optimized MaxEnt model. Our results identified the main environmental factors influencing Phellodendron, predicted their potential geographical distribution, and assessed migration trends under climate change in China. Our analysis showed that Ph. amurense and Ph. chinense have potential suitable habitats of 62.89 x 104 and 70.71 x 104 km2, respectively. Temperature and precipitation were found to play an essential role in shaping the present geographical distribution of Phellodendron populations. Based on two future climate scenarios, we forecasted that the potential suitable habitat of Ph. amurense would decrease by 12.52% (SSP245) and increase by 25.28% (SSP585), while Ph. chinense would decline by 19.61% (SSP245) and 15.78% (SSP585) in the late-21st century. The potential suitable habitats of Ph. amurense and Ph. chinense would shift to northward and westward, respectively. Hydrothermal change was found to be the primary driver of the suitable habitat of Phellodendron populations in the future. We recommend establishing nature reserves for existing Phellodendron populations, especially Ph. chinense. Our study provided a practical framework for the impact of climate change on the suitable habitat of Phellodendron species and guided regional cultivation, long-term conservation, and sustainable use.

The lack of robust perception capabilities in machine vision systems for construction hazard inspection poses significant safety concerns. To address this, we propose a novel method that leverages human knowledge extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to enhance machine vision through transfer learning. By pretraining convolutional neural networks with EEG data recorded during construction hazard evaluations, we investigated three common on-site hazard classifications using small datasets. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method resulted in improved accuracy (with an 11% increase) and enhanced rationality of machine learning predictions (as revealed by network visualization analysis). This research opens avenues for further exploration and industry applications, aiming to achieve more intelligent and human-like artificial visual perception, ultimately enhancing safety and efficiency in automated hazard inspection.

Correction for respiratory motion often relies on a respiratory signal describing the heart displacements during breathing. However, using external tracking devices to estimate respiratory signals can add cost and operational complications in a clinical setting. PurposeWe aim to develop a deep learning (DL) approach that uses only SPECT projection data for respiratory signal estimation. MethodsA modified U-Net was implemented that takes temporally finely sampled SPECT sub-projection data (100 ms) as input. These sub-projections are obtained by reframing the 20-s list-mode data, resulting in 200 sub-projections, at each projection angle for each SPECT camera head. The network outputs a 200-time-point motion signal for each projection angle, which was later aggregated over all angles to give a full respiratory signal. The target signal for DL model training was from an external stereo-camera visual tracking system (VTS). In addition to comparing DL and VTS, we also included a data-driven approach based on the center-of-mass (CoM) strategy. This CoM method estimates respiratory signals by monitoring the axial changes of CoM for counts in the heart region of the sub-projections. We utilized 900 subjects with stress cardiac perfusion SPECT studies, with 302 subjects for testing and the remaining 598 subjects for training and validation. ResultsThe Pearson's correlation coefficient between the DL respiratory signal and the reference VTS signal was 0.90, compared to 0.70 between the CoM signal and the reference. For respiratory motion correction on SPECT images, all VTS, DL, and CoM approaches partially de-blured the heart wall, resulting in a thinner wall thickness and increased recovered maximal image intensity within the wall, with VTS reducing blurring the most followed by the DL approach. Uptake quantification for the combined anterior and inferior segments of polar maps showed a mean absolute difference from the reference VTS of 1.7% for the DL method for patients with motion >12 mm, compared to 2.6% for the CoM method and 8.5% for no correction. ConclusionWe demonstrate the capability of a DL approach to estimate respiratory signal from SPECT projection data for cardiac perfusion imaging. Our results show that the DL based respiratory motion correction reduces artefacts and achieves similar regional quantification to that obtained using the stereo-camera VTS signals. This may enable fully automatic data-driven respiratory motion correction without relying on external motion tracking devices.	[Chen, Yuan; Pretorius, P.

MethodsData was prospectively collected for 281 women undergoing endometrial cancer surgery in 2016, 2018 and 2019 (robotic surgery was introduced in November 2017). ResultsThe proportion of obese and morbidly obese patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) significantly increased following robotic surgery introduction from 43.8% to 69.6% (p < 0.001). Overall robotic surgery operating time was not affected by higher body mass index (r = 0.177, 95% CI -0.068-0.402). There was no difference in the length of stay or in the frequency and severity of complication rates between obese, morbidly obese and non-obese populations undergoing MIS. ConclusionRobotic surgery led to a significant rise in MIS and improved surgical outcomes for obese and morbidly obese women with endometrial cancer within 12 months of its introduction.

Methods: We retrieved the records of patients who underwent vNOTES twice at our institute between April 2019 and December 2022 and analyzed their baseline information and perioperative complications, and compared the pre- and postoperative sexual function of both vNOTES. Results: Patients' mean age and body mass index were 29.00 +/- 3.59 and 30.4 +/- 4.00 years and 21.89 +/- 3.69 and 22.76 +/- 3.88 kg/m(2), respectively, when receiving the first and second vNOTES. Ectopic pregnancy was the most frequent indication for vNOTES, with 7 cases in the first vNOTES and 11 cases in repeated vNOTES. The interval between the two vNOTESs ranged from 9 days to 38 months. The operation duration (63.33 +/- 13.71 vs. 67.33 +/- 22.51 min, p = 0.723), intraoperative estimated blood loss (32.00 +/- 20.42 vs. 30.00 +/- 9.26 mL, p = 0.429), and duration of postoperative hospital stay (2.20 +/- 0.56 vs. 2.40 +/- 0.51 days, p = 0.082) of both vNOTESs were comparable. No significant differences were found in any of the domains in the comparison of pre-first and post-first vNOTES, pre-second and post-second vNOTES, and pre-first and post-second vNOTES female sexual function index. None of the patients delivered after the second vNOTES. Conclusion: Repeated vNOTES is safe and feasible. No significant change in the patients' sexual function was found in our cohort after the first and second vNOTES.

Here we show that succinic ester-containing diglycine drastically boosts the cellular uptake of supramolecular assemblies or prodrugs. Specifically, autohydrolysis of the diglycine-activated succinic esters turns the nanofibers of the conjugates of succinic ester and self-assembling motif into nanoparticles for fast cellular uptake. The autohydrolysis of diglycine-activated succinic esters and drug conjugates also restores the efficacy of the drugs. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) suggests that a "U-turn" of diglycine favors intramolecular hydrolysis of diglycine-activated succinic esters to promote autohydrolysis. As an example of rapid autohydrolysis of diglycine-activated succinic esters for instant cellular uptake, this work illustrates a nonenzymatic bond cleavage approach to develop effective therapeutics for intracellular targeting.

It may be particularly so in the post COVID-19 era, where many still suffer from the pandemic's after-effects. We propose a novel pathway to maintain and improve employee well-being: organizational nostalgia, one's sentimental longing or wistful affection for past organizational events. We advocate that organizational nostalgia is associated with job satisfaction and organizational commitment and that telecommuting frequency (i.e., the extent to which employees work remotely) moderates this association. Additionally, we examine employees' perceptions of organizational cultural strength as an antecedent of organizational nostalgia. Findings from two studies support our theoretical proposals and offer fresh insight into how organizations could sustain their employees' well-being by leveraging organizational nostalgia.

After obtaining informed consent, participants completed the EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaires. We evaluated sexual function after treatment for TC using the EORTC QLQ-TC26 and analyzed the impact of treatment on sexual function in TC survivors.ResultsA total of 567 TC survivors responded to the EORTC QLQ-TC26. Median age at the time of response was 43 years (interquartile range [IQR] 35-51 years), and median follow-up period after treatment was 5.2 years (IQR 2.2-10.0 years). Sexual function, particularly ejaculatory function, was significantly lower after post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC-RPLND) than after Surveillance or Chemotherapy groups (p < 0.05). In the PC-RPLND group, nerve-sparing procedure preserved postoperative ejaculatory function after RPLND compared with the non-nerve-sparing and offered improved ejaculatory function with time. On multivariate analysis, RPLND was a significant predictor of post-treatment ejaculatory dysfunction, particularly without nerve-sparing (odds ratio 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.7, p < 0.05). In addition, TC survivors with nerve-sparing RPLND had higher sexual activity than those without.ConclusionThis survey of the EORTC QLQ-TC26 showed that sexual function and activity in TC survivors after RPLND was reduced in the absence of nerve-sparing techniques.

J	Lee, E; Ilseven, E; Puranam, P				Lee, Eucman; Ilseven, Ekin; Puranam, Phanish			Scaling nonhierarchically: A theory of conflict-free organizational growth with limited hierarchical growth	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						formal modeling; microstructures; organizational design; scaling	PRODUCT MARKET COMPETITION; FLATTENING FIRM; MANAGEMENT; INNOVATION; KNOWLEDGE; TEAMS; MODEL; INTERDEPENDENCE; MODULARITY; SOFTWARE	Research SummaryWe propose a theory that explains variations in the relationship between an organization's size and the extent of its authority hierarchy (as captured in managerial intensity). Conceptualizing authority hierarchy as a means to manage conflicts among subordinates, we formulate a model in which the number of managers required depends on the magnitude of conflicts generated between and within groups of workers. Our analysis shows that scaling non-hierarchically can be accomplished either by creating low conflict "self-managing" teams or reducing conflicts between many "self-contained" teams, but which path is more effective varies by situation. Small initial differences in terms of their emphasis on within vs. between team conflict mitigation can lead to large differences as firms scale over time in the extent of their authority hierarchies.Managerial SummaryManaging without an extensive hierarchy can be attractive for a variety of reasons, but under what conditions is it possible in large scale organizations? We build on the premise that the managerial hierarchy of authority serves to resolve conflicts that employees cannot resolve peer-to-peer (i.e., there are limits to scaling groups that manage themselves consensually). We develop a formal theory that predicts that there are three levers that can slow down the growth of managerial hierarchy even as the organization scales: investing in the technology and culture needed to (a) expand managerial capacity particularly toward the apex of the hierarchy (b) create "self-managed" teams that produce few conflicts in need of managerial resolution and (c) create "self-contained" teams that generate few conflicts between them that need escalation up the hierarchy for resolution. The third is likely to be the most effective lever as organizations grow.

The accordance between the incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and subjects with low and moderate cardiovascular risk is unclear. HypothesisSubjects with low and moderate cardiovascular risk have a lower incidence of subclinical atherosclerosis compared with subjects with high risk. MethodsBrachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV) and brachial flow-mediated dilation (BFMD) were measured in 421 subjects without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) from October 2016 to January 2020. All subjects were classified into low, moderate, and high risk based on Framingham and China-par risk models respectively. ResultsMean age was 57.05 & PLUSMN; 9.35 years and 248 (58.9%) were male. In subjects with low, moderate, and high risk assessed by Framingham and China-par risk models, the percentage of abnormal BaPWV ( > 1400 cm/s) was 42.9%, 70.1%, 85.7%, and 40.4%, 71.4%, 89.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the percentage of abnormal BFMD ( & LE; 7%) was 43.8%, 68.5%, 77.3%, and 44.9%,72.1%, and 76.6%. According to Framingham-based high-risk categories, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity for BaPWV abnormality were 85.7%, 39.4%, 36.1%, and 87.5%, respectively. For BFMD abnormality, the values were 77.3%, 40.1%, 34.1%, and 81.8%, respectively. According to China-par high-risk categories, the values for BaPWV abnormality were 89.7%, 43.8%, 45.6%, and 89.0%, respectively. For BFMD abnormality, the values were 76.6%, 41.3%, 40.7%, and 77%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, age and blood pressure were the independent predictors for subclinical atherosclerosis in subjects with low-moderate risk. ConclusionsMore than one-half of subjects with low and moderate risk already have detectable subclinical atherosclerosis, indicating higher cardiovascular risk beyond the traditional stratification.

Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single-junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open-circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non-radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo-active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non-radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor-acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor-acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

Five streetscape design prototypes are proposed that include climate-adaptive spatial interventions appraised qualitatively with consideration to relevant feasibility matters: land use planning, equity, affordability, mobility, and sense of place. The study shows that there is potential for climate-adaptive interventions in informal urban areas in hot arid climates, but that these interventions also present challenges. Common climate-adaptive design strategies can be used to address heat stress in these areas but, for example, increasing vegetation might be challenging due to water stress. As a conceptual study, the findings presented and the discussion raised on feasibility are targeted at opening avenues for future research, and at informing decision-makers and spatial designers.

EDCs are chemicals that mimic, block, or interfere with hormones in the body's endocrine system and have been associated with a wide range of health issues. This innovative, untargeted metabolomics study investigates chronic low-dose internal exposure to a cocktail of POPs on multiple tissues that are known to accumulate these lipophilic compounds. Interestingly, the metabolic response differs among selected tissues/organs in mice. In the liver, we observed a dynamic effect according to the exposure time and the doses of POPs. In the brain tissue, the situation is the opposite, leading to the conclusion that the presence of POPs immediately gives a saturated effect that is independent of the dose and the duration of exposure studied. By contrast, for the adipose tissues, nearly no effect is observed. This metabolic profiling leads to a holistic and dynamic overview of the main metabolic pathways impacted in lipophilic tissues by a cocktail of POPs.

Little is known about their responses to intraluminal pressure. During embryonic development, hepatocytes assemble apical bulkheads that increase the canalicular resistance to intraluminal pressure. Here, we investigate whether they also protect bile canaliculi against elevated pressure upon impaired bile flow in adult liver. Apical bulkheads accumulate upon bile flow obstruction in mouse models and patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Their loss under these conditions leads to abnormally dilated canaliculi, resembling liver cell rosettes described in other hepatic diseases. 3D reconstruction reveals that these structures are sections of cysts and tubes formed by hepatocytes. Mathematical modelling establishes that they positively correlate with canalicular pressure and occur in early PSC stages. Using primary hepatocytes and 3D organoids, we demonstrate that excessive canalicular pressure causes the loss of apical bulkheads and formation of rosettes. Our results suggest that apical bulkheads are a protective mechanism of hepatocytes against impaired bile flow, highlighting the role of canalicular pressure in liver diseases.

J	Miromanova, A				Miromanova, Anna			Quantifying the trade-reducing effect of embargoes: Firm-level evidence from Russia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE			English	Article; Early Access							ECONOMIC SANCTIONS; IMPACT	In 2014, Russia responded to sanctions imposed by a coalition of Western countries with a retaliatory import embargo. I draw on this unique case study and a customs data set on firm-level import transactions to investigate the ramifications of Russia's counter-sanctions on firm-level foreign trade. Using detailed data and a triple-difference estimation strategy, I examine micro-level dynamics and heterogeneities that aggregate data alone do not reveal. I identify the effects of the embargo on the extensive margin (the probability that a firm imports a particular product from a given country in a particular time period) and the intensive margin (the value of a firm's import transaction) of firm-level trade, as well as its effects on logged unit values. The main findings of this study show that the embargo had statistically significant negative impacts on extensive and intensive margins of firm-level trade. I also pinpoint evidence of multiple exemptions from the embargo and a large degree of heterogeneity of firm-level responses to the embargo based on firm attributes, such as firm size and government connection.

The key tool in the study of these logics is the lattice-theoretic notion of an n-filter. We study the logics of all (complete, consistent, and classical) n-filters on De Morgan lattices, which are non-adjunctive generalizations of the four-valued logic of Belnap and Dunn (of the three-valued logics of Priest and Kleene, and of classical logic). We then show how to find a finite Hilbert-style axiomatization of any logic determined by a finite family of prime upsets of finite De Morgan lattices and a finite Gentzen-style axiomatization of any logic determined by a finite family of filters on finite De Morgan lattices. As an application, we axiomatize Shramko's logic of anything but falsehood.

This motivates early detection of small granules of CAC; however, calcium scan sensitivity for detecting very low levels of calcium has not been quantified. PurposeIn this work, the size limit of detectability of small calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) granules with clinical CAC scanning was assessed using validated simulations. MethodsCT projections of digital 3D mathematical phantoms containing small CaHA granules were simulated analytically; images were reconstructed using a filter designed to reproduce the point spread function of a specific commercial scanner, and a relationship of HU number versus diameter was derived. These simulation results were validated with experimental measurements of HU versus diameter from phantoms containing small granules of CaHA on a GE Revolution CT scanner in the clinic; ground truth measurements of the CaHA granule diameters were obtained using a Zeiss Xradia 510 Versa high-resolution 3D micro-CT imaging system. Using experimental measurements on the clinical CT scanner, detectability was quantified with a detectability index (d') using a non-prewhitened matched filter. The effect of changes to reconstruction slice thickness and reconstruction kernel on granule detectability was evaluated. ResultsUnder typical clinical calcium scanning and reconstruction conditions, the minimum detectable diameter of a simulated spherical calcium granule with a clinically relevant CaHA density was 0.76 mm. The minimum detectable volume was 2.4 times smaller on images reconstructed at a slice thickness of 0.625 mm compared to 2.5 mm. The detectability index d' increased by a factor of 1.7 when images were reconstructed with 0.625 mm slices compared to 2.5 mm slices. d' did not change when images were reconstructed with the high-resolution BONE filter compared to the less sharp STANDARD resolution filter on the GE Revolution CT. ConclusionsWe have quantified detectability versus size of small calcium granules at the resolution limit of a widely available clinical CT scanner. Detectability increased significantly with reduced slice thickness and did not change with a sharper reconstruction kernel. The simulation can be used to calculate the trade-off between dose and CAC detectability.

Then, a numerical solution is obtained by means of COMSOL Multiphysics and is validated through comparisons with existing solutions and measured data. The parametric studies show that the difference between large-strain consolidation and small-strain consolidation reduces with the decreases of the compression index and applied load. Although the soil self-weight has little effect on the degree of consolidation in some cases, the soil settlement will be significantly overestimated if the self-weight is ignored. The development of consolidation slowed as the ratio of compressibility over horizontal permeability increased.

Eras of designer Tregs: Harnessing synthetic biology for immune suppression	IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS			English	Review; Early Access						CAR; cell therapy; engineering; gene therapy; regulatory T cells; TCR	REGULATORY T-CELLS; VERSUS-HOST-DISEASE; PERIPHERAL HOMEOSTASIS; ALLOGRAFT-REJECTION; FOXP3 ISOFORMS; CUTTING EDGE; ACTIVATION; THERAPY; GENERATION; EXPRESSION	Since their discovery, CD4(+)CD25(hi)FOXP3(hi) regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been firmly established as a critical cell type for regulating immune homeostasis through a plethora of mechanisms. Due to their immunoregulatory power, delivery of polyclonal Tregs has been explored as a therapy to dampen inflammation in the settings of transplantation and autoimmunity. Evidence shows that Treg therapy is safe and well-tolerated, but efficacy remains undefined and could be limited by poor persistence in vivo and lack of antigen specificity. With the advent of new genetic engineering tools, it is now possible to create bespoke "designer" Tregs that not only overcome possible limitations of polyclonal Tregs but also introduce new features. Here, we review the development of designer Tregs through the perspective of three 'eras': (1) the era of FOXP3 engineering, in which breakthroughs in the biological understanding of this transcription factor enabled the conversion of conventional T cells to Tregs; (2) the antigen-specificity era, in which transgenic T-cell receptors and chimeric antigen receptors were introduced to create more potent and directed Treg therapies; and (3) the current era, which is harnessing advanced genome-editing techniques to introduce and refine existing and new engineering approaches. The year 2022 marked the entry of "designer" Tregs into the clinic, with exciting potential for application and efficacy in a wide variety of immune-mediated diseases.

The impact of COVID-19 on mortality, length of stay, and cost of care among patients with gastrointestinal malignancies: A propensity score-matched analysis	CANCER MEDICINE			English	Article						COVID-19; gastrointestinal cancer; healthcare cost disparity; impact of COVID-19 on gastrointestinal malignancies; mortality; propensity score-matched analysis; SARS-CoV-2	CANCER; CORONAVIRUS; RISK	Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic have had a lasting impact on the care of cancer patients. The impact on patients with gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies remains incompletely understood. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mortality, length of stay (LOS), and cost of care among patients with GI malignancies, and identify differences in outcomes based on primary tumor site. Methods: We analyzed discharge encounters collected from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) between March 2020 and December 2020 using propensity score matching (PSM) and COVID-19 as the treatment effect. Results: Of the 87,684 patient discharges with GI malignancies, 1892 were positive for COVID-19 (C+) and eligible for matching in the PSM model. Following PSM analysis, C+ with GI tumors demonstrated increased incidence of mortality compared to their COVID-19-negative (C-) counterparts (21.3% vs. 11.9%, p < 0.001). C+ patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) had significantly higher mortality compared to those who were C-( 40% vs. 24%; p = 0.035). In addition, C+ patients with GI tumors had a longer mean LOS (9.4 days vs. 6.9 days; p < 0.001) and increased cost of care ($26,048.29 vs. $21,625.2; p = 0.001) compared to C-patients. C+ patients also had higher odds of mortality secondary to myocardial infarction relative to C-patients (OR = 3.54, p = 0.001). Conclusions: C+ patients with GI tumors face approximately double the odds of mortality, increased LOS, and increased cost of care compared to their C-coun-terparts. Outcome disparities were most pronounced among patients with CRC.	[Ulanja, Mark B.

Herein, the synchronous modification of complicated Volmer/Tafel kinetics is effectuated for attaining ampere-level current density hydrogen production via engineering double-tuned RuCo nanoalloy and dual metal single atoms on hierarchical N-doped mesoporous carbon (RuCo@RuSACoSA-NMC). The electronic structure of Ru sites in dual metal single atoms can be synergistically tailored by adjacent Co atomic sites and nanoalloy, which makes it achieve faster Volmer kinetics with rapid water adsorption/dissociation and transfer rates toward adsorbed hydroxyl. While double-tuned Ru sites in nanoalloy by adjacent alloyed Co sites and dual metal single atoms undertake optimized Tafel kinetics with boosted transfer rates toward adsorbed hydrogen. Accordingly, RuCo@RuSACoSA-NMC exhibits ultralow HER overpotential of 255 mV at 1 A cm(-2) with robust stability over 24 days, ultrahigh mass activity of 37.2 A mg(Ru)(-1), and turnover frequency of 19.5 s(-1). More importantly, RuCo@RuSACoSA-NMC can make water electrolysis system possess low power consumption of 5.34 kWh per Nm(H2)(3) and estimated costs of 1.197 $ per kg(H2). The concept emphasized in this study provides guidance for rational design of cost-effective catalysts with ampere-level current density hydrogen production.

The texture is a sensory property that covers a group of attributes, such as firmness, tenderness, chewiness, adhesiveness, resilience, etc., which greatly determine consumers' perception and satisfaction for flesh products. Regarding texture quality, extensive research has been conducted in recent decades based on its related theories, influencing factors, and intervention strategies. However, the information available is largely scattered and disjointed. Essentially, flesh texture is mainly determined by the collective contribution of three major muscle components: muscle fibres, intramuscular connective tissue, and intramuscular fat. Therefore, changing these components in living animals through nutritional and management factors has the potential to modulate texture quality. Here, we briefly introduced the features and development of the three muscle components mentioned above, particularly their potential contributions to texture quality of fish flesh. Exciting promises to manipulate flesh texture through dietary intervention, feed restriction, and exercise training were also discussed. To ensure their applications in large-scale aquaculture facilities, specific considerations of these regimens should be incorporated in experimental design parameters, including the species and age of fish, research system, experiment duration, and exercise intensity. Finally, the existing challenges and limitations of fish texture studies were presented, along with some viewpoints about current work and future directions of this field.

GWFI is characterized by the presence of subcutaneous warbles at the lumbar and sacral region of dorsum in the infested animal. The early larval instars (L1 and L2) remain inaccessible to physical detection due to their small size and subcutaneous presence thus causing hindrance in the diagnosis. The objective of present study was to develop a field applicable early diagnostic intervention for GWFI monitoring and prophylactic management for effective control of the disease. Recombinant Hypodermin C (rHyC) antigen of P. silenus was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein was used for optimizing dot-ELISA in a checkerboard titration using goat warble fly infested serum as known positive. The optimized assay was further tested for lower temperature (18 & DEG;C) and incubation time (30 min). The optimized assay was assessed for inter-rater reliability and field samples. The optimized conditions require 188 ng of protein/dot, 1:800 dilution of serum sample, 1:4000 dilution of anti-goat IgG conjugate and 5% skim milk powder in phosphate buffer saline as blocking buffer. The assay was found to have a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 97.3% and 95.8%, respectively. The inter-rater reliability of dot ELISA with rHyC indirect ELISA was found to be almost perfect with a Cohen's kappa index of 0.973. Further testing at ambient temperature (18 & DEG;C) and shorter incubation steps (30 min) supported suitability of the assay for field diagnosis of GWFI.

Scratch depth was analyzed with respect to three parameters: velocity, thermal cycle, and direction of the scratch. The results showed that thermal aging has a significant effect on the scratch behavior of CFRCs, with an increase in thermal cycle leading to an increase in scratch depth. The scratch depth was also found to be greater in the weft direction compared to the warp direction, which can be attributed to the difference in fiber arrangement and orientation in the CFRC material. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to investigate the effect of thermal aging on the scratch behavior of CFRCs. The ANOVA results revealed that the direction of the scratch has a significant effect on scratch depth, with the weft direction showing greater scratch depth compared to the warp direction. The surface roughness of CFRCs was analyzed under thermal aging conditions and with an increase in thermal cycle leading to an increase in surface roughness. The roughness values were found to be higher in the weft direction compared to the warp direction, which can be attributed to the difference in fiber arrangement and orientation in the CFRC material.

J	Hu, D; Tian, ZP; Lang, XM; Jiang, DB				Hu, Dan; Tian, Zhiping; Lang, Xianmei; Jiang, Dabang			Regional difference in precipitation seasonality over China from CMIP6 projections	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						annual cycle; moisture budget; precipitation; projection; seasonality	RAINFALL SEASONALITY; ANNUAL CYCLE; WATER CYCLE; INTENSIFICATION; TEMPERATURE	Based on historical simulations and projections under two scenarios of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) provided by 32 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we investigate the future precipitation seasonality changes over China by two indices, the dimensionless seasonality index (DSI) and the relative seasonality index (SI), and the associated physical mechanisms by moisture budget diagnosis. The results show that relative to the baseline period 1995-2014, the DSI is enhanced across almost all of China at the end of the 21st century, with stronger magnitudes in southeastern China and the southern Tibetan Plateau and weaker magnitudes in northwestern China, and national-mean enhancements are 15% (7%-21%) and 23% (15%-29%) for the multimodel median (25th-75th percentile range across models) under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively. Projected SI changes show large regional differences, with decreases in northern China and increase in southern China, leading to little change for the national mean. The DSI and SI changes are associated with uneven distributions of changes in absolute amounts and relative proportions of precipitation among seasons, respectively. Further analysis reveals that the contributions of different moisture budget terms to precipitation changes vary across seasons, resulting in changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation and thus the DSI and SI changes. Specifically, the thermodynamic component of vertical moisture advection primarily determines the greater magnitude of increased precipitation in summer than in winter in most of China, resulting in the DSI change. The reduction in residual term dominates the diminished winter precipitation in southern China, leading to more precipitation concentrated in summer for given annual precipitation and thus the intensification in SI, while the opposite holds true in northern China.

Motivated by the lack of descriptive information related to complaint handling that can be used in assessing managerial performance, we collect organizations' responses to consumer complaints via Twitter and apply Zemke and Schaaf's (1990) traditional service recovery model to explore these. We collected 10,305 tweets that describe the use of Twitter for service recovery by organizations across four industries: airlines, casual dining chain restaurants, hotels, and fast-food restaurants. The findings show that in our sample, the traditional service recovery model with five service recovery elements (apology, urgent reinstatement, empathy, symbolic atonement, and follow-up) is implemented to various degrees. Furthermore, we identify three additional service recovery elements not previously discussed by prior research: channel transfer, feedback acknowledgment, and information request. Our findings have research implications and highlight the importance of incorporating online customer complaints into managerial performance systems.

Materials and MethodsThis prospective cohort study used the UK Biobank. Polyneuropathy was defined based on nurse-led interviews or ICD codes for polyneuropathy. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the association of polyneuropathy with clinical outcomes. ResultsA total of 459,127 participants were included in the analysis. Polyneuropathy was significantly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and with CVD events even after adjusting for CVD risk factors across all diabetes statuses. Metabolic parameters HbA(1c), waist circumference, BMI and the inflammatory parameter C-reactive protein showed significant mediation effects for the association between polyneuropathy and CVD. Adherence to a favorable lifestyle was associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality regardless of polyneuropathy status. ConclusionsPolyneuropathy was associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, and with CVD events in subjects with diabetes or prediabetes, even those having normal glucose tolerance. This study suggests the importance of polyneuropathy as a risk factor for death and highlights the necessity of early diagnosis and lifestyle intervention for those with type 2 diabetes and polyneuropathy.

However, data on temporal trends of cause-specific hospital readmissions in these patients are limited. Methods and resultsFrom 1987 to 2014, we identified and followed up for 1 year 608 135 patients & GE;18 years hospitalized with HF according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 and 10 from the National Inpatient Register. Readmissions for cardiovascular (CVD) and non-CVD causes and co-morbidities were defined according to ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. We analysed trends in the incidence rate of readmissions, the median time to the first rehospitalization, and the time to readmission, stratified by sex, age groups and cause of rehospitalization using linear regression. During our study, 1 year all-cause mortality decreased (& beta; = -4.93, P < 0.0001), but the incidence rate of readmissions per 1000 person-years remained unchanged. The readmission rate for CVD causes decreased; in contrast, the readmission rate increased across all age and sex groups for non-CVD causes. Analysing the patients by study periods (1987-1997, 1998-2007 and 2008-2014), CVD and non-CVD co-morbidities had a statistically significant increasing trend (P < 0.001). The median time in hospital decreased and the median time to the first readmission were almost unchanged. ConclusionsContrary to a declining mortality rate, the incidence rate of readmissions saw no change, possibly because of divergent trends in cause-specific readmissions. An increasing rate of readmissions for non-CVD causes underscores the importance of optimising multimorbidity management to reduce the risk of readmissions in patients with HF.

Four-dimensional (4D) printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However, ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems, low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time-intensive nature. Here, a paradigm for a one-step shape/material transformation, high-2D/3D/4D-precision, high-efficiency, and scalable 4D additive-subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC-based ceramic materials. The uniformly deposited Al2O3-rich layer on the printed SiOC-based ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation performance of the complex-shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is expected to broaden the applications of high-temperature structural materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.

Rather than understanding this interim outcome along the lines of now widespread narratives of corporate "disruption", in this article I take up Manuel B. Aalbers' notion of "regulated deregulation" in order to foreground the state's role as a manically prolific facilitator of early Uberisation. Based on ethnographic research in Toronto, I argue that the three longer-standing state spatial strategies of (1) the common-sense neoliberal state, (2) the labour-averse competition state, and (3) the tech-infatuated smart state were paramount in creating those "on-the-ground" conditions-social, legal, spatial, and other-on which Uber has been able to thrive in many cities across the North American continent.

This work introduces such a pipeline based on an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers. The dataset consists of 36,338 spectra from one healthy subject and five brain tumor patients, acquired with an EPSI variant, which implemented a novel type of spectral editing named SLOtboom-Weng (SLOW) editing on a 7T MR scanner. The spectra were labeled manually by an expert into four classes of spectral quality as follows: (i) noise, (ii) spectra greatly influenced by lipid-related artifacts (deemed not to contain clinical information), (iii) spectra containing metabolic information slightly contaminated by lipid signals, and (iv) good-quality spectra.The AI model consists of three pairs of networks, each comprising a convolutional autoencoder and a multilayer perceptron network. In the classification step, the encoding half of the autoencoder is kept as a dimensionality reduction tool, while the fully connected layers are added to its output. Each of the three pairs of networks is trained on different representations of spectra (real, imaginary, or both), aiming at robust decision-making. The final class is assigned via a majority voting scheme.The F1 scores obtained on the test dataset for the four previously defined classes are 0.96, 0.93, 0.82, and 0.90, respectively. The arguably lower value of 0.82 was reached for the least represented class of spectra mildly influenced by lipids.Not only does the proposed model minimise the required user interaction, but it also greatly reduces the computation time at the metabolite quantification step (by selecting a subset of spectra worth quantifying) and enforces the display of only clinically relevant information.

Herein, a sustainable approach for recycling non-sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale-up modules is developed. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole-selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3-ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As a result, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3-ITO anodes achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm(2)), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3-ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T-80 lifetime of & AP;10 000 h.

One of the most accepted etiologies is multifactorial (gene-environment). This study aimed to identify the amendable risk factors of an orofacial cleft in Northern Thailand. A retrospective case-control study in Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital was conducted from 2011 to 2020. One hundred and seventeen cases of CL/P and CPO were included. Forty-nine normal children were enrolled in a time-matched control group. Exploratory survey data on maternal exposures were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted association between maternal exposures and CL/P, and CPO occurrence. Multivariate analysis identified three predisposing factors that increased the risk of CL/P and CPO. The first factor was caffeine consumption with a total amount of 560 mg/week (adjusted OR: 7.59; 95% CI: 2.48-23.23; p < 0.001). The second factor was any smoker or passive smoking (adjusted OR: 8.47; 95% CI: 1.63-43.92; p = 0.011). The third factor was a low socioeconomic status (income of lower than 270 USD/month; adjusted OR: 4.05; 95% CI: 1.07-15.27; p = 0.039). From the 10-year study in Northern Thailand: caffeine consumption, exposure to cigarette smoke, and low socioeconomic status were identified as associated negative factors for orofacial clefts. We propose that preconceptional counseling for risk reduction should be emphasized in reducing the mother's exposure to these factors. Future investigations in large multicenter populations are suggested.

The TDF was applied to analyse transcripts using a combined deductive framework and inductive thematic analysis approach. Identified influences were mapped to the behaviour change technique taxonomy to identify potential strategies to change dietary behaviour in this context.Results Key barriers to healthy dietary behaviours were access and cost of food available during night work (TDF domain: Environment Context and Resources). Factors identified as both enablers and barriers included: availability of staff facilities and time to take a break, (Environment Context and Resources), the physical impact of night work (Beliefs About Consequences), eating in response to stress or tiredness (Emotion), advance planning of meals/food and taking own food to work (Behavioural Regulation). Potential techniques to address these influences and improve dietary behaviour in this context include: meal planning templates, self-monitoring and biofeedback, and increasing accessibility and availability of healthier food choices during night shifts.Conclusions The dietary behaviour of shift workers with T2D is influenced by interacting individual, socio-cultural and environmental factors. Intervention should focus on environmental restructuring and strategies that enable monitoring and meal planning.

However, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at some concentrations causes anthocyanin degradation. The present study aimed to reduce the degradation of PJ anthocyanins as a result of HMF at various concentrations (0-20 mg L-1) through phenolic acid [PA; ferulic (FA), gallic (GA) and caffeic acids (CA)] copigmentation during storage at 20 & DEG;C. RESULTSA strong correlation (r = 0.872) was found between anthocyanin degradation rate and HMF concentration in PJ without PA addition. An increase in HMF concentration during storage caused faster (< 32%) anthocyanin degradation. However, PA addition reduced (< 60 times) the HMF formation rate. The lowest HMF formation rates (0.07-0.28 day(-1)) were determined in PJ with added GA. Although GA caused an important increase in content of cyanidin-3-glucoside (16-42%), which is major PJ anthocyanin, against HMF at all concentrations, CA (15%) and FA (28%) increased cyanidin-3-glucoside content against 10 mg of HMF L-1. FA maintained its protection effect against the highest HMF concentration (20 mg of HMF L-1), but CA lost its protection effect. Generally, FA increased stabilities of hyperchromic effect (HE) (9.6-27.7%) and colour density (CD) (57.1-74.3%) at all HMF concentrations, although CA increased HE stability (19.8-37.7%) in the presence of 10 and 20 mg of HMF L-1. Interactions of 'all individual anthocyanins-FA' and 'delphinidin-based anthocyanins-GA/CA' resulted in copigmentation. CONCLUSIONFA addition was recommended to increase CD and HE for PJ containing HMF between 3.1-5.6 mg L-1, whereas the addition of GA was recommended to increase anthocyanin stability for PJ containing 12.0 mg of HMF L-1. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

Vision Transformer predicts saliency by modelling long-range dependencies from sequence to sequence with convolution-free. It is challenging to distinguish the salient objects' location and obtain structural details for the influence of extracting irrelevant contextual information. A novel saliency sparse Transformer network is proposed to exploit sparse attention to guide saliency prediction. The convolution-like with dilation in the token to token (T2T) module is replaced to achieve relationships in larger regions and to improve contextual information fusion. An adaptive position bias module is designed for the Vision Transformer to make position bias suitable for variable-sized RGB images. A saliency sparse Transformer module is designed to improve the concentration of attention on the global context by selecting the Top-k of the most relevant segments to improve the detection results further. Besides, cross-modality to exploit the complementary RGB and depth modality fusion module (CMF) is used to take advantage of the complementary RGB image features and spatial depth information to enhance the feature fusion performance. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate this method's effectiveness and superiority that it is suitable for saliency prediction comparable to state-of-the-art RGB and RGB-D saliency methods.

Auxetic metamaterials are the class of cellular structures designed to possess negative Poisson's ratio. The current study evaluates newly developed re-entrant diamond auxetic metamaterial's in-plane and out-of-plane three-point bending performance. A series of experimental and numerical studies are performed to assess the quasistatic performance and crashworthiness characteristics of 3D-printed re-entrant diamond auxetic core and sandwich panels. The results are compared with regular re-entrant panels of the same unit cell size. The deformation and failure mechanism of both auxetic structures, core and sandwich, are discussed. Real-time displacement contours on the specimen surface are visualized using advanced image processing and finite-element methods. The new re-entrant diamond auxetic members outperformed energy absorption characteristics in in-plane and out-plane directions. Compared to the counterpart, the new metamaterial has improved 88.33% and 29.24% in-plane energy absorption as a core and sandwich, respectively. 13.51% and 13.35% increments in energy absorption as a core and sandwich are observed for re-entrant diamond structures compared to the regular re-entrant system in the out-of-plane direction.

Predicting the production of these toxins before they occur is a significant challenge. In this study, we innovatively developed a strategy called targeted acquisition of toxin-related immunogen (TATRI) to identify early diagnostic biomarkers for microbial toxins. Taking Aspergillus flavus as an example, we employed an immunoassay-based screening approach to identify nanobodies that exhibited significant response signals to different toxigenic strains. Subsequently, we isolated and purified the specific immunogen pre-aflatoxin biomarker PAB-01 that bound to the selected nanobody. The results showed that the level of PAB-01 was positively correlated with the toxin-producing ability of A. flavus strains and could be detected before the production of aflatoxins. It met the essential requirements as an early diagnostic biomarker for aflatoxin contamination. Protein identification and bioinformatics analysis revealed that PAB-01 is a glycoprotein that can be secreted into the extracellular space. It is located on chromosome 5 of A. flavus and belongs to the 75 family of glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, we used 7 g/kg as the critical concentration of PAB-01 to diagnose the risk of aflatoxin contamination in stored peanuts, with an accuracy rate of 75.9% for high-risk samples. In summary, this work provides a promising approach for the identification of protein biomarkers prior to microbial toxin production and the establishment of early diagnostic techniques for microbial toxins.

Polyvinyl chloride, as a white pollutant, is a soft carbon precursor that can be carbonized at varying temperatures to produce soft carbons with controllable defect and crystal structures. This work investigates the effect of carbonization temperature on the crystalline structures of the obtained soft carbons. In situ Raman spectroscopy was used to elucidate the adsorption-intercalation charge storage mechanism of potassium ions in soft carbons. Soft carbons prepared at the temperature of 800 & DEG;C have a defect-rich, short-range ordered structure, which provides optimal intercalation and adsorption sites for potassium ions, resulting in a satisfactory capacity of 302 mAh g(-1). This work presents new possibilities for designing soft carbon materials from recycling plastics for potassium-ion batteries.

Reduced incidence of tick paralysis cases in dogs and cats at two emergency clinics in South-East Queensland since 2015: new generation prophylactics as possible explanatory variables	AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Article						cat; dog; incidence; isoxazoline; Ixodes holocyclus; tick paralysis	IXODES-HOLOCYCLUS; RISK-FACTORS	IntroductionThis study aimed to determine the incidence of canine and feline tick paralysis cases presenting to two veterinary emergency hospitals before and after the introduction of new generation prophylactic acaricides. MethodsThis was a retrospective study, investigating the number of tick paralysis cases presenting to two emergency and critical care veterinary hospitals in South-East Queensland, from 2008 to 2021. A total of 10,914 dogs and 3696 cats were included over the course of the study. To assess if the introduction of new generation prophylactics in 2015 has coincided with any variation in case numbers, data for each species were analysed graphically and numerically in the first instance, then interrupted time series analyses were performed for the dog and cat data independently. ResultsAccounting for seasonal and climatic variation, we estimated a 54.8% reduction in dog (95% CI 45.3%-62.7%) and 44% reduction in cat (95% CI 19.5%-46%) tick paralysis cases presenting to these two clinics. This reduction corresponded with the timing of new generation prophylactic agents being introduced, including isoxazolines and imidacloprid/flumethrin impregnated collars. ConclusionIn the population studied, a significant reduction in the incidence of tick paralysis cases treated by veterinarians has occurred from 2015 onwards and was found to be associated with the timing of the release of new generation acaricidal products.

This paper presents a Multi-task architecture that addresses the classification and segmentation tasks for COVID-19 detection. The model comprises an encoder for feature representation, a decoder for segmentation, and a multi-layer perceptron for classification. Evaluations conducted on two datasets demonstrate the model's performance in both classification and segmentation. To enhance efficiency and diagnosis accuracy, CT-scan images undergo pre-processing using image processing algorithms like histogram equalization, median filtering, and mathematical morphology operations. The combination of the median filter pre-processing and the proposed model yields impressive results in the classification task, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with values of 0.97, 0.97, and 0.96, respectively, for dataset 1, and 0.96 in mentioned metrics for dataset 2. For segmentation, the proposed model, particularly with the average morphology pre-processing, exhibits excellent performance with high accuracy, low mean squared error, high peak signal-to-noise ratio, high structural similarity index, and a mean dice coefficient of 88.86 & PLUSMN; 0.05 for dataset 1, and 87.97 & PLUSMN; 0.02 for dataset 2. Furthermore, the pre-trained models consistently demonstrate the superiority of the median filter and proposed model in the classification task on the same datasets. In conclusion, the proposed multi-task model, incorporating image processing techniques, achieves remarkable results in both classification and segmentation. The utilization of pre-processing algorithms and the multi-task framework significantly contribute to superior performance metrics. This study encourages further exploration of combining diverse image processing algorithms to advance infection diagnosis and treatment.

RAD51 as a biomarker for homologous recombination deficiency in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma: robustness and interobserver variability of the RAD51 test	JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY CLINICAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						analytical validation; biomarker; high-hrade serous ovarian carcinoma; homologous recombination deficiency; interobserver variability; RAD51 test	CANCER	The RAD51 test is emerging as a promising biomarker for the assessment of functional homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Yet, the robustness and reproducibility of the immunofluorescence-based RAD51 test, in different academic laboratories, have not been systematically investigated. Therefore, we tested the performance of the RAD51 assay in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) samples in four European laboratories. Here, we confirm that subtle differences in staining procedures result in low variability of RAD51 and & gamma;H2AX scores. However, substantial variability in RAD51 scoring was observed in some samples, likely due to complicating technical and biological features, such as high RAD51 signal-to-noise ratio and RAD51 heterogeneity. These results support the need to identify and perform additional quality control steps and/or automating image analysis. Altogether, resolving technical issues should be a priority, as identifying tumours with functional HRD is urgently needed to guide the individual treatment of HGSOC patients. Follow-up studies are needed to define the key tissue quality requirements to assess HRD by RAD51 in FFPE tumour samples, as this test could help in guiding the individual treatment of HGSOC patients.

Herein, three novel pentafulvalene-fused derivatives with or without fluorine atoms incorporated (YSH-oF and YSH-mF and YSH-H, respectively) are designed, synthesized, and applied as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) in PSCs fabrication. The fluorinated HTMs, YSH-oF and YSH-mF, exhibited higher hole mobility and better charge extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface than non-fluorinated one do, presumably due to the closer intermolecular & pi;-& pi; packing interactions. As a result, small-area (0.09 cm(2)) PSCs made with YSH-oF and YSH-mF achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.59% and 22.76% respectively, with negligible hysteresis, in contrast with the 20.57% for the YSH-H-based devices. Furthermore, for large-area (1.00 cm(2)) devices, the PSCs employing YSH-oF exhibited a PCE of 21.92%. Moreover, excellent long-term device stability is demonstrated for PSCs with F-substituted HTMs (YSH-oF and YSH-mF), presumably due to the higher hydrophobicity. This study shows the great potential of fluorinated pentafulvalene-fused materials as low-cost HTM for efficient and stable PSCs.

However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution-processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal-semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution-printed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A(-1), approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal-to-noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 x 10(5), which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

Sebaceous hyperplasia, sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous epithelioma are common cutaneous lesions in dogs; however, their dermoscopic features have not been investigated.Hypothesis/Objectives The objectives of this study are to describe the dermoscopic features of canine sebaceous lesions and to assess the interobserver agreement on dermoscopic parameters.Animals Thirty-four lesions excised from 17 client-owned dogs, histologically confirmed as sebaceous proliferations, were included in this study.Materials and Methods Sebaceous lesions were evaluated in vivo at x10 magnification with a handheld dermoscope. Each dermoscopic image was assessed independently by two ECVD board-certified veterinary referral clinicians and an ECVD resident.Results Thirty sebaceous hyperplasias, two sebaceous adenomas and two sebaceous epitheliomas were included. Dermoscopically, most lesions (91%) had single or multiple, well-defined, white-yellowish structures composed of grouped ovoid areas (clods). Irregular linear and, less commonly, arborising vessels were detected at the periphery of the yellow lobular-like structures in 93% of sebaceous hyperplasias and in 50% of neoplastic lesions. Erosions were seen in 6% of sebaceous hyperplasias and 50% of neoplastic lesions. Good interobserver agreement was found for white/yellowish clods (k = 0.75), yellow scales (k = 0.83), brown/grey dots (k = 0.80), erosions (k = 0.82) and red/brownish scales/crusts (k = 0.75). There was moderate agreement for fissures (k = 0.48) and vascular pattern (k = 0.51-0.53).Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Dermoscopy represents a useful technique to assess sebaceous gland proliferations in dogs, as it is in humans.

To achieve flexible and arbitrary designs for scattering-field reduction, a diffusion-absorption hybrid metasurface is proposed based on the Babinet principle. This hybrid metasurface adopts complementary bilayer metasurfaces to satisfy the impedance matching condition and employs a hybrid absorption and diffusion mechanism. Such complementary designs' intralayer resonances and interlayer couplings are tailored by multi-objective optimization, achieving the precise and wideband design of absorptive elements with a specific reflection phase. By optimizing the spatial distributions of elements, diffusion is introduced and designs are achieved with a continuous scattering-field reduction from 15.40 to 32.58 dB at 15 GHz. Three representative designed structures are fabricated and verified as proof of concept. The experimental results are consistent with the calculations and simulations, demonstrating a 12.32-24.46 dB scattering-field reduction range. The proposed high-freedom metasurface and the implementation multi-objective optimization strategy collectively empower flexible wavefront manipulation, offering a viable solution for designing hybrid meta-devices that incorporate multiple mechanisms.

Guardians' perceptions of caring for a dog with canine cognitive dysfunction	VETERINARY RECORD			English	Article; Early Access						burden of care; companion animal; dog dementia; pet caregiving; senior	BEHAVIORAL-CHANGES; CLINICAL SIGNS; CAREGIVER BURDEN; PREVALENCE; IMPAIRMENT; OWNERS	BackgroundCanine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is difficult to diagnose, as its clinical signs are similar to those of other age-related conditions. The experience of caring for a senior dog with or without CCD is not well described. MethodsData were collected via an online survey. Using a mixed methods design, the level of CCD and burden of care were measured using validated tools, and open-ended questions gathered qualitative data. A general linear model showed the factors associated with guardian burden of care. ResultsSixteen percent of guardians experienced a clinically significant burden of care. Factors associated with burden of care included severity of CCD, sleep location, guardian employment, household size, dog age, guardian age and the dog taking medication. Few dogs with CCD were prescribed CCD medications to ameliorate clinical signs. Euthanasia, strong attachment mitigating burden and the complexities of caregiving were themes presented by guardians. LimitationsMeasures are based on self-reports and as such the usual limitations apply. ConclusionsThe burden of caring for an older dog is greater if they have CCD. More attention to the treatment of senior dogs, including medications to reduce clinical signs of CCD, could improve the welfare of older dogs and decrease the clinical burden experienced by guardians.

A limited number of patients can receive standard second-line therapy (DS-8201 or T-DM1) for metastatic HER2-positive in some parts of the world, including China, due to many factors, such as cost-benefit ratios. CaseA 51-year-old premenopausal woman was diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer. The pathological stage was ypT3N2M0 and stage IIIA. Trastuzumab targeted therapy combined with goserelin depot was started along with letrozole endocrine therapy. After eight courses of treatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination revealed new multiple metastases in the liver, and progression disease (PD) was evaluated. Due to abnormal activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway in the patient, treatment was changed to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor combined with the anti-HER-2 agents inetetamab and paclitaxel, while partial response (PR) was evaluated after 6 cycles of treatment. As the patient was hormone receptor (HR) positive, treatment was changed to the inetetamab + rapamycin + exemestane regimen. The lesion continued to shrink and PR was evaluated for 8 cycles. The original regimen was continued, PR was evaluated after 12 courses of treatment. The abdominal MRI performed showed an increase in the volume of intrahepatic multiple metastatic tumor lesion. Efficacy was used to assess for PD and the progression-free survival (PFS) was 317 days. ConclusionA phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutation in trastuzumab-treated metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer female had a long PFS by treating with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor in combination with the anti-HER-2 agent inetetamab.

Postnatal growth restriction impairs rat lung structure and function	ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						growth restriction; lung development; lung disease; preterm	PPAR-GAMMA; BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA; FATTY-ACIDS; PARENCHYMAL MECHANICS; PULMONARY-FUNCTION; ALVEOLAR FORMATION; NASAL VENTILATION; INFANTS; EXPRESSION; NUTRITION	The negative impact of nutritional deficits in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is well recognized, yet mechanisms by which nutrition alters lung outcomes and nutritional strategies that optimize development and protect the lung remain elusive. Here, we use a rat model to assess the isolated effects of postnatal nutrition on lung structural development without concomitant lung injury. We hypothesize that postnatal growth restriction (PGR) impairs lung structure and function, critical mediators of lung development, and fatty acid profiles at postnatal day 21 in the rat. Rat pups were cross-fostered at birth to rat dams with litter sizes of 8 (control) or 16 (PGR). Lung structure and function, as well as serum and lung tissue fatty acids, and lung molecular mediators of development, were measured. Male and female PGR rat pups had thicker airspace walls, decreased lung compliance, and increased tissue damping. Male rats also had increased lung elastance, increased lung elastin protein abundance, and lysol oxidase expression, and increased elastic fiber deposition. Female rat lungs had increased conducting airway resistance and reduced levels of docosahexaenoic acid in lung tissue. We conclude that PGR impairs lung structure and function in both male and female rats, with sex-divergent changes in lung molecular mediators of development.

Forest productivity recovery or collapse? Model-data integration insights on drought-induced tipping points	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						canopy collapse; drought; gross primary productivity; terrestrial carbon cycle; tipping points	TREE MORTALITY; CARBON DYNAMICS; GAS-EXCHANGE; ECOSYSTEMS; MECHANISMS; SURVIVAL; HEAT; FIRE; SOIL	More frequent and severe droughts are driving increased forest mortality around the globe. We urgently need to describe and predict how drought affects forest carbon cycling and identify thresholds of environmental stress that trigger ecosystem collapse. Quantifying the effects of drought at an ecosystem level is complex because dynamic climate-plant relationships can cause rapid and/or prolonged shifts in carbon balance. We employ the CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework (CARDAMOM) to investigate legacy effects of drought on forest carbon pools and fluxes. Our Bayesian model-data fusion approach uses tower observed meteorological forcing and carbon fluxes to determine the response and sensitivity of aboveground and belowground ecological processes associated with the 2012-2015 California drought. Our study area is a mid-montane mixed conifer forest in the Southern Sierras. CARDAMOM constrained with gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates covering 2011-2017 show a similar to 75% reduction in GPP, compared to negligible GPP change when constrained with 2011 only. Precipitation across 2012-2015 was 45% (474 mm) lower than the historical average and drove a cascading depletion in soil moisture and carbon pools (foliar, labile, roots, and litter). Adding 157 mm during an especially stressful year (2014, annual rainfall = 293 mm) led to a smaller depletion of water and carbon pools, steering the ecosystem away from a state of GPP tipping-point collapse to recovery. We present novel process-driven insights that demonstrate the sensitivity of GPP collapse to ecosystem foliar carbon and soil moisture states-showing that the full extent of GPP response takes several years to arise. Thus, long-term changes in soil moisture and carbon pools can provide a mechanistic link between drought and forest mortality. Our study provides an example for how key precipitation threshold ranges can influence forest productivity, making them useful for monitoring and predicting forest mortality events.	[Au, J.; Wong, C.

The electrode-resolved analysis is used to distinguish the kinetic and transport losses at the respective electrodes. For fine to medium-sized particles at the negative electrode, ageing impacts are found more on the positive electrode: the impedance and nonlinear responses increase, suggesting that the charge transfer process at the positive electrode is worsened. Meanwhile, for coarse and broad negative particles, the impedance and nonlinear responses at negative electrodes decrease due to improved kinetics from micro-cracking. The second harmonic reveals a change in the nature of the charge transfer during ageing: the charge transfer process at the positive electrode becomes asymmetric for fine and medium-sized negative particles. Vice versa, the charge transfer process at the negative electrode becomes symmetric for coarse and broad negative particles.

J	Chen, B; Coppieters, S				Chen, Bin; Coppieters, Sam			Unified digital image correlation under meshfree framework	STRAIN			English	Article; Early Access						meshfree digital image correlation; meshfree method; metrological efficiency indicator; unified digital image correlation; unified framework	DEFORMATION MEASUREMENTS	The implementation of digital image correlation (DIC) involves several different problems, such as image prefiltering, image intensity gradient calculation, image intensity interpolation at subpixel positions, shape function construction and strain calculation. This paper offers a unified insight into the nature of several key problems in DIC technique. We treat all the problems involved in the former mentioned key steps as fundamentally the same problem, that is, reconstructing an analytical description from a discrete and noisy sampling of a signal, such as discrete image intensity and displacement at some scattered nodes. From the reconstructed analytical description, the gradient and physical value at subpixel or integral pixel position can be analytically calculated without extra error. Here, we solve all these problems using the same mathematical tool, the meshfree method, leading to a unified DIC (U-DIC) method. This method introduces errors solely during the steps involving the determination of the continuous description. However, it effectively avoids errors in the remaining steps. It holds the best balance between spatial resolution and measurement resolution for both displacement and strain measurements compared to 28 state-of-the-art DIC algorithms based on the benchmark tests on DIC Challenge 2.0. It also holds all the unique advantages of the advanced meshfree DIC (MF-DIC) compared to conventional local DIC and global DIC. The novel concept and excellent balance between spatial resolution and measurement resolution make U-DIC an attractive replacement for conventional DIC methods. Additionally, the consistency of the implementation procedures in U-DIC can simplify the parameter selection in DIC, which is of potential for the standardization of DIC technique.

Our study suggests a novel PCA treatment method based on a heterogeneous advanced oxidation process (AOP) that proceeds in an electron exchange matrix (EEM) prepared by the incorporation of redox-active specie in silica matrices using the sol-gel synthesis route. The results, which are supported by DFT calculations, show that the silicon skeleton of the EEM has two important roles, both as a porous matrix that hosts the redox species and as an oxidant species involved in the AOP. The calculations indicate that the formation of a radical on the nitrogen is favored. The suggested mechanism could shed light on the AOP, which proceeds in a heterogenous system, and on its application inside the understudied EEMs that, until now, have been a virtual black box.A better understanding of the mechanism could lead to improved control over the heterogeneous processes that can play a critical role in industries with the need to treat small amounts of toxic compounds at low concentrations, such as in the pharmaceutical industry.

Despite their undoubtful clinical success, these compounds are associated with severe side effects and poor tumor selectivity. To overcome these drawbacks, the development of platinum(IV) molecular prodrugs and nanoparticle formulations that remain stable and therapeutically inactive in a biological environment, but could be quickly reduced into the therapeutically active analogs through a specific trigger have been thought. Within this article, the mechanisms for chemical and photophysical triggers for the activation of platinum(IV) prodrugs have been critically reviewed.

Here, we performed a GWAS to identify genetic factors associated with H. pylori serostatus in a cohort of admixed children from a large Latin American urban center. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 1161 children from 4 to 11 years old living in poor areas of Salvador, in northeastern Brazil. Logistic regression analysis was performed to detect associations between single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and H. pylori seropositivity, assuming an additive genetic model. Enrichment analyses were conducted using the MAGMA v1.10 software. Results: We found 22 SNVs to be suggestively associated ( p < 10-5) with H. pylori seropositivity. The most suggestive SNV was the rs77955022 ( p = 4.83e-07) located in an intronic region of EXOC3 at 5p15.33. The second most suggestively associated SNV was rs10914996 (p = 8.97e-07), located in an intergenic region at 1p34.3. Furthermore, we were able to replicate three SNVs (p < 0.05) in the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) cohort: the rs2339212 and rs4795970, both located at 17q12 near TMEM132E, as well as the rs6595814, an intronic variant of FBN2 at 5q23.3. The enrichment analysis indicated the participation of genes and metabolic pathways related to the regulation of the digestive system and gastric acid secretion in the risk of seropositivity for H. pylori. Conclusions: Additional studies are required to validate these association findings in larger population samples and to get insight into the underlying physiological mechanisms.

However, river water frequently contains elevated levels of pathogenic Escherichia coli, which has adverse effects on human health. This study adopted a quantitative microbial risk assessment to analyze seasonal risks to canoeists' health in the Dongshan River, Taiwan. First, river E. coli concentrations were statistically analyzed to determine the seasonal distributions. The exposure duration (ED) was determined by field observations. To propagate the parametric uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulation was employed to model the probability distributions of seasonal pathogenic E. coli levels, ingestion rates, and ED for athletes. Finally, the beta-Poisson dose-response model was implemented to determine seasonal health risks for canoeists. The study results indicated that the health risks in infection probability ranged from 0.5 x 10(-3) to 8.8 x 10(-3) illnesses/person/day for tourists and 1.2 x 10(-3) to 7.7 x 10(-3) illnesses/person/day for athletes. The health risks in the Lizejian Bridge area for tourists exceeded an acceptable level suggested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 8 x 10(-3) illnesses/person/day, in spring for an ED of 2 h/day, and the health risks for tourists and athletes approached this level in spring and winter for an ED exceeding or equaling 1.5 h/day. According to sensitivity analysis, the geometric standard deviation of river E. coli levels was the most sensitive parameter affecting seasonal risks to canoeists' health. To protect canoeists' health, effluent sewer systems, best management practices, and total maximum daily loads should be promptly implemented in this watershed.

Magnetic Manipulation of Superparamagnetic Colloids in Droplet-Based Optical Devices	ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						colloidal assembly; compartmentalisation; magnetic field; microfluidics; particles	PLATELETS; DYNAMICS	Magnetically assembled superparamagnetic colloids are exploited as fluid mixers, swimmers, and delivery systems in several microscale applications. The encapsulation of such colloids in droplets may open new opportunities to build magnetically controlled displays and optical components. Here, the assembly of superparamagnetic colloids inside droplets under rotating magnetic fields is studied, and this phenomenon is exploited to create functional optical devices. Colloids are encapsulated in monodisperse droplets produced by microfluidics and magnetically assembled into dynamic 2D clusters. Using an optical microscope equipped with a magnetic control setup, the effect of the magnetic field strength and rotational frequency on the size, stability, and dynamics of 2D colloidal clusters inside droplets is investigated. The results show that cluster size and stability depend on the magnetic forces acting on the structure under the externally imposed field. By rotating the cluster in specific orientations, it is possible to magnetically control the effective refractive index and the transmission of light through the colloid-laden droplets, thus demonstrating the potential of the encapsulated colloids in optical applications.

Silk Fibroin Particles as Carriers in the Development of Hemoglobin-Based Oxygen Carriers	ADVANCED NANOBIOMED RESEARCH			English	Article						biopolymers; microparticles; oxygen carrier; silk fibroin	ENCAPSULATED HEMOGLOBIN; NANOPARTICLE MANUFACTURE; POLYMERIZED HEMOGLOBIN; BOVINE HEMOGLOBIN; HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK; BLOOD; DRUG; STABILIZATION; BIOMATERIALS; STABILITY	Oxygen therapeutics has a range of applications in transfusion medicine and disease treatment. Synthetic molecules and all-natural or semisynthetic hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) have seen success as potential circulating oxygen carriers. However, many early HBOC products stalled in development due to side effects from excess hemoglobin in the blood stream and hemoglobin entering the tissue. To overcome these issues, research has focused on increasing the molecular diameter of hemoglobin by polymerizing hemoglobin molecules or encapsulating hemoglobin in liposomal carriers. This work leverages the properties of silk fibroin, a cytocompatible and nonthrombogenic biopolymer, known to entrap protein-based cargo, to engineer a fully protein-based oxygen carrier. Herein, an all-aqueous solvent evaporation technique is used to form silk particles via phase separation from a bulk polyvinyl alcohol phase. Particle size is tuned, and particles are formed with and without hemoglobin. The encapsulation efficiency and ferrous state of hemoglobin are analyzed, resulting in 60% encapsulation efficiency and a maximum of 20% ferric hemoglobin, yielding 100 & mu;g mL(-1) active hemoglobin in certain silk fibroin-HBOCs formulations. The system does not elicit a strong inflammation response in vitro, demonstrating the potential for this particle system to serve as an injectable HBOC.	[Pacheco, Marisa O. O.; Lutz, Henry M.

HRM is typically performed in the office with local anesthesia only, and many patients find it unpleasant and painful. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the use of a virtual reality (VR) headset on pain and anxiety outcomes in patients with dysphagia undergoing HRM.Methods: Patients with dysphagia were prospectively recruited and randomized to undergo HRM with and without VR distraction. Data collected included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-6 (STAI-6), the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, heart rate, and galvanic skin response (GSR) tracings.Results: Forty subjects completed the study, including 20 subjects in the intervention arm and 20 in the control arm. There was evidence of a significant positive effect of VR on calmness (p = 0.0095) STAI-6 rating, as well as on physiologic measures of pain with significantly decreased GSR rise time (p = 0.0137) and average rate of change of conductance change (p = 0.0035).Conclusion: The use of VR during HRM catheter insertion increased calmness compared to control. Change of skin conductance was also reduced in the VR group, suggesting decreased physiologic pain. This study supports the consideration of the use of VR as a distraction tool to improve patient comfort during HRM.

MethodsIn this study, 41 patients with GTCS, comprising 21 untreated patients and 20 patients who received antiseizure medications (ASMs), and 29 healthy controls were recruited to construct large-scale brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Structural and functional connectivity and network-level weighted correlation probability (NWCP) were further investigated to identify network features that corresponded to response to ASMs. ResultsUntreated patients showed more extensive enhancement of functional and structural connections than controls. Specifically, we observed abnormally enhanced connections between the default mode network (DMN) and the frontal-parietal network. In addition, treated patients showed similar functional connection strength to that of the control group. However, all patients exhibited similar structural network alterations. Moreover, the NWCP value was lower for connections within the DMN and between the DMN and other networks in the untreated patients; receiving ASMs could reverse this pattern. SignificanceOur study identified alterations in structural and functional connectivity in patients with GTCS. The influence of ASMs may be more noticeable within the functional network; moreover, abnormalities in both the functional and structural coupling state may be improved by ASM treatment. Therefore, the coupling state of structural and functional connectivity may be used as an indicator of the efficacy of ASMs.	[Pei, Haonan; Ma, Shuai; Yan, Wei; Liu, Zetao; Wang, Yuehan; Yang, Zhihuan; Yao, Dezhong; Jiang, Sisi; Luo, Cheng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu Brain Sci Inst, Sch Life Sci & Technol, MOE Key Lab Neuroinformat,Clin Hosp, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Pei, Haonan; Ma, Shuai; Yan, Wei; Liu, Zetao; Wang, Yuehan; Yang, Zhihuan; Yao, Dezhong; Jiang, Sisi; Luo, Cheng] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Res Unit NeuroInformat 2019RU035, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Ma, Shuai; Yu, Liang] Affiliated Hosp Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sichuan Acad Med Sci & Sichuan Prov Peoples Hosp, Neurol Dept, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Li, Qifu; Yao, Dezhong] Hainan Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Haikou, Peoples R China; [Yao, Dezhong; Jiang, Sisi; Luo, Cheng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, High Field Magnet Resonance Brain Imaging Key Lab, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cheng; Yu, Liang] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Second North Jianshe Rd, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China	University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital; Hainan Medical University; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; University of Electronic Science & Technology of China	Luo, C; Yu, L (corresponding author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Second North Jianshe Rd, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China.	chengluo@uestc.edu.cn; 18981838653@163.com	; Luo, Cheng/A-4647-2015	Pei, Haonan/0000-0001-5202-5216; Luo, Cheng/0000-0003-0524-5886					60	0	0	6	6	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA		2470-9239		EPILEPSIA OPEN	Epilepsia Open	SEP	2023	8	3					1038	1048		10.1002/epi4.12781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/epi4.12781		JUL 2023	11	Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Neurosciences & Neurology	R3MH2	37394869	Green Published, gold			2023-10-18	WOS:001034031300001

Studies utilising olfactometer bioassays form the foundation for understanding the behavioural responses of invertebrates to chemical stimuli under standardised laboratory conditions. Widely used olfactometry apparatuses include two-arm olfactometers for binary responses through to four- and six-arm arenas to evaluate more complex behaviours. Despite its prevalence in chemical ecology studies, there has never been a review of experimental best practice in olfactometry. This review critically evaluates both olfactometry methods and applications as well as experimental design and analysis. We aim to outline a standard of good practice to improve experimental design and reporting for studies involving olfactometry, thereby establishing a reference guide to build a robust experimental workflow for olfactometry bioassays.

A copolymer, poly([[(butylamino)carbonyl]oxy]ethyl-ester)-co-polydimethylsiloxane (referred to as PP), is synthesized and subsequently complexed with alumina particles coated with liquid metal (LMAl2O3) to prepare a composite material called PP/LMAl2O3 with high thermal conductivity and strong interfacial adhesion to address this challenge. The best thermal conductivity (4.43 W m(-1) K-1), electrical insulation (10(-6)-10(-7) S m(-1)), and adhesion properties derived from hydrogen bonding (1316 N m(-2)) are obtained by adjusting the volume fraction of PP and LMAl2O3 in PP/LMAl2O3. PP/LMAl2O3 with high thermal conductivity and high interface adhesion can efficiently transfer heat between thermal flux sensors and the objects being sensed, reliably detecting small thermal flux variations and ensuring accurate thermal flux measurements. In this study, PP/LMAl2O3 is used to make up thermosensitive tactile sensor. Surprisingly, PP/LMAl2O3 demonstrates high thermal signal sensitivity for tactile recognition applications, allowing the smart thermosensitive tactile sensor system to distinguish unknown rock materials even in the dark. Overall, PP/LMAl2O3 may function as a fundamental material in thermosensitive tactile sensors for lithology identification.

However, mechanisms of how different active fillers enhance ion transport in CSEs still remain inconclusive. In this work, the component dependencies of ionic conductivity of PEO-based CSEs are investigated by comparing two widely investigated active fillers: NASICON-type (LATP) and garnet-type (LLZTO). In terms of ionic conductivity, the optimum ratios are strikingly different for LLZTO (10 wt%) and LATP (50 wt%). Through experimental and computational studies, it is demonstrated that the high affinity between LATP and PEO facilitates unhindered interfacial Li+ transfer so that LATP functions as a bulk-active filler to provide additional inorganic ion pathways. By contrast, Li+ transfer between LLZTO and PEO is found to be sluggish. Instead, LLZTO mainly improves ionic conductivity by dissociating lithium salt, making it a surface-active filler. Through categorizing active fillers based on their Li+ conductive mechanisms, this work provides new understanding and guidelines for componential design and optimization of solid composite electrolytes.

Thirteen population-based registries in 10 countries from the European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) network participated. Data on children born 1995-2014 and diagnosed with Turner syndrome were linked to mortality, hospital and prescription records. Children with any congenital anomaly and children without a congenital anomaly were included for comparison on morbidity.Results: Out of a population of 5.8 million livebirths 404 were diagnosed with Turner syndrome prenatally or in infancy and 95.5% survived to their fifth birthday. During the first year of life 72.3% (95% CI 59.5;81.6) of children with Turner syndrome were hospitalized, the median length of stay was 5.6 days (95% CI 3.5;7.7) and 18.7% (95% CI 13.9;23.9) underwent surgery. After the first year of life hospitalizations and length of stay decreased but more children underwent surgery (30.8% [95% CI 17.6;44.7]). In the first 5 years the percentage of children with Turner syndrome having a prescription for antibiotics was 12%-20% per year and increased with the age of child.Conclusions: In the first year of life, the burden of disease was relatively high for children with Turner syndrome. The outlook is more positive beyond the first year, though overall morbidity still exceeded that of children without congenital anomalies.

Squaramide-Based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion-Pair Recognition	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article						heteroditopic receptors; NaCl ion-pair; rotaxane; sodium cation template; squaramide	METAL TEMPLATE SYNTHESIS; ANION RECEPTORS; AROMATICITY; EXTRACTION; ROTAXANES; BOND	A series of squaramide-based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesized using an alkali metal cation template-directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative H-1 NMR spectroscopic anion and ion-pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion-pair mechanical bond axle-macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20-fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion-pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion-pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion-pair binding properties of the squaramide-based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.

J	Cabrera, ML; Noor, N; Moore, L				Cabrera, Miguel L. L.; Noor, Nadia; Moore, Logan			Evaluation of passive flux samplers with different orifice sizes to measure ammonia volatilization losses	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							EMISSIONS; UREA	A common passive sampler used to measure NH3 volatilization losses in field studies has a nozzle with a 1-mm, round orifice that reduces air flow to increase NH3 adsorption. This reduction in air flow, measured by the orifice's K value (0-1), implies a reduction in the amount of NH3 entering the sampler per unit of time, which may require a longer exposure to accumulate measurable quantities of NH3. Increasing the diameter of the orifice would increase the NH3 entering the sampler and possibly allow shorter exposure times, but it may also lead to increased NH3 bypass. The objectives of this research were to (1) determine the effect of wind speed on NH3 bypass in samplers with 1- or 2-mm orifices, (2) determine the reduction in air speed in samplers with 1- or 2-mm orifices by determining their K values, and (3) compare field NH3 volatilization losses measured with 1- and 2-mm orifices. A laboratory study with wind speeds ranging from 0.6 to 10 m & BULL;s(-1) showed that both orifice sizes had NH3 bypass at low and high wind speeds. Results from wind tunnel studies determined that flow was reduced to 63% (K = 0.63) in 1-mm orifices and to 74% (K = 0.74) in 2-mm orifices. Field studies indicated that 1-mm orifices may measure greater NH3 volatilization losses than 2-mm orifices at average low wind speeds when maximum wind speeds <10 m & BULL;s(-1), but may measure equal or lower losses than 2-mm orifices when several days occur with maximum wind speeds >10 m & BULL;s(-1).

J	Dierickx, K; Oueslati, T; Profico, A				Dierickx, Katrien; Oueslati, Tarek; Profico, Antonio			Geometric morphometric analysis of Pleuronectiformes vertebrae: A new tool to identify archaeological fish remains?	JOURNAL OF ANATOMY			English	Article; Early Access						fish remains; geometric morphometrics; ichthyoarchaeology; zooarchaeology	FLOUNDER PLATICHTHYS-FLESUS; EUROPEAN FLOUNDER; SHAPE; IDENTIFICATION; SIDEDNESS	Flatfish (Pleuronectiformes) vertebrae are difficult to identify to species due to the lack of diagnostic features. This has resulted in a lack of understanding of the species abundances across archaeological sites, hindering interpretations of historical fisheries in the North Sea area. We use a new approach, utilising a combined 2D landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis as an objective and non-destructive method for species identification of flatfish vertebrae from the North Sea area. Modern specimens were used as a reference to describe the morphological variation between taxa using principal component analysis (PCA) and to trial an automated classification using linear discriminant analysis. Although there is limited distinction between taxa using PCAs, the classification shows high accuracies, indicating that flatfish species identifications using geometric morphometrics are possible. Bone samples (n = 105) from two archaeological sites in the United Kingdom and France were analysed using this approach and their identifications were verified using collagen peptide mass fingerprinting. The success rate of species identification was usually less than 50%, indicating that this technique has limited applicability due to preservation/fragmentation of archaeological fish bone. Nonetheless, this could prove a valuable tool for modern and non-fragmented samples. Furthermore, the technique applied in this study can be easily adapted to work on other landmark datasets.

MutMap, genotyping, and gene editing results demonstrated that CsSEC23, which is the core component of COPII vesicles, mediates the glossiness of cucumber fruit peel. CsSEC23 is functionally conserved and located in the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum. CsSEC23 could interact with CsSEC31, but this interaction was absent in the Csgp mutant, which decreased the efficiency of COPII vesicle transportation. Genes related to wax and cutin transport were upregulated in the Csgp mutant, and the cuticle structure of the Csgp-mutant peel became thinner. Moreover, the wax and cutin contents were also changed due to CsSEC23 mutation. Taken together, the results obtained from this study revealed that CsSEC23 mediates cucumber glossiness, and this mediating might be affected by COPII vesicle transportation.

Climate change is shifting weather patterns, leading to unpredictable and catastrophic events that further threaten the agronomic sector. Plant scientists are implementing biotechnological tools to sustainably increase both the production and nutritional content of our crops. Engineering GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors is a promising route to improve photosynthesis, as well as other important agronomical traits, to achieve food security for a growing population under an unpredictable climate. Using agricultural biotechnology to increase the photosynthetic efficiency of crops has been a focus of plant science research over the last two decades. Transcription factors coordinate the expression of gene networks that are the basis of plant development and physiological responses and, as such, are good targets to help improve photosynthesis. Among the known plant transcriptional regulators, GOLDEN2-LIKE transcription factors (GLKs) may be ideal candidates to improve photosynthesis in crops, as they are master regulators of genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast biogenesis across a broad diversity of plant lineages. Moreover, recent work has revealed their involvement in environmental response, pathogen defence and development regulation across the plant's whole life cycle. Thus, manipulating GLK expression and activity, alone or likely in combination with other modifications, has clear potential to improve plant development and growth. Here, we review the research into GLK function and discuss the potential of these key transcription factors as biotechnological tools to enhance photosynthetic efficiency and stress tolerance in crops. Additionally, we take advantage of the vast plant genome and transcriptome datasets available to explore the evolutionary history of GLKs across the plant kingdom and discuss the implications for their adoption into crop engineering projects.

Super-massive transfusion during liver transplantation	TRANSFUSION			English	Article; Early Access						liver transplantation; outcomes; risk factors; super-massive blood transfusion	INTRAOPERATIVE TRANSFUSION; ULTRAMASSIVE TRANSFUSION; REQUIREMENTS; PREDICTION	Background: Massive hemorrhage and transfusion during liver transplantation ( LT) present great challenges. We aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors for super-massive transfusion (SMT) and survival outcome and factors that negatively affect survival in patients who received SMT during LT. Study Design and Methods: We included adult patients undergoing LT from 2004 to 2019. SMT was defined as transfusion of >= 50 units of red blood cells (RBC) during LT. Independent risk factors were identified by multivariable logistic regression. Ninety-day survival was recorded and factors that negatively affected survival were analyzed by the Cox survival test. Results: Of 2772 patients, 158 (5.6%) received SMT during LT. Mean RBC transfusion was 72.6 (+/- 23.4) units with a maximum of 168 units. Four variables (MELD-Na score, previous upper abdominal surgery, portal vein thrombosis, and remote retransplant) were independent risk factors for SMT (odds ratio 1.800-8.274, 95% CI 1.008-16.685, all p < .005). The 90-day survival rate in SMT patients was 81.6%. Preoperative pulmonary hypertension and massive postreperfusion transfusion negatively affected 90-day survival (hazard ratio 2.658-4.633, 95% CI 1.144-10.130, and all p < .05). Conclusions: In this large retrospective study, we found that SMT occurred in a small percentage of patients and was associated with relatively satisfactory short-term survival. Identification of preoperative risk factors for SMT and factors that negatively affect survival improve our understanding of this unique LT patient population.

MethodsFirst, in a development cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the RFCA with 40 W was performed to complete SVC isolation guided by the conduction breakthrough point from the right atrium to SVC. Then, the range of AI value was calculated by offline analysis on different segments of SVC. Lastly, for the validation of AF patients, the safety and effectiveness of SVC isolation with the optimized target range of AI value were evaluated with an additional adenosine test. ResultsA total of 101 patients with AF were included in the study (44 patients in the development cohort/57 in the validation cohort). The segmental ablation strategy was applied in 70% of the patients. According to the offline analysis of the AI values in the development cohort, the target AI value range was set as 350-400. The success rate of SVC isolation in the validation cohort was significantly higher than that in the exploration cohort (100% vs. 90.9%, p = .02), and no complications occurred in the exploration cohort. During the adenosine test, the recovery rate of electrical conduction in SVC was significantly lower than that in the pulmonary vein (3.5% vs. 17.5%). ConclusionThe target AI value with a range from 350 to 400 is safe and effective for high-power RFCA to complete SVC isolation.

Sudden cardiac arrest in athletes and strategies to optimize preparedness	CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY			English	Review; Early Access						AED; athletes; CPR; emergency action planning; preparticipation screening; sudden cardiac arrest; sudden cardiac death	AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS; AMERICAN-HEART-ASSOCIATION; EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; BYSTANDER CPR; ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; CARDIOVASCULAR-ABNORMALITIES; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT	Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in young athletes. Despite efforts to improve preparedness for cardiac emergencies, the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in athletes remains high, and bystander awareness and readiness for SCA support are inadequate. Initiatives such as designing an emergency action plan (EAP) and mandating training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external defibrillator use (AED) for team members and personnel can contribute to improved survival rates in SCA cases. This review provides an overview of SCA in athletes, focusing on identifying populations at the highest risk and evaluating the effectiveness of different screening practices in detecting conditions that may lead to SCA. We summarize current practices and recommendations for improving the response to SCA events, and we highlight the need for ongoing efforts to optimize preparedness through the implementation of EAPs and the training of individuals in CPR and AED use. Additionally, we propose a call to action to increase awareness and training in EAP development, CPR, and AED use for team members and personnel. To improve outcomes of SCA cases in athletes, it is crucial to enhance bystander awareness and preparedness for cardiac emergencies. Implementing EAPs and providing training in CPR and AED use for team members and personnel are essential steps toward improving survival rates in SCA cases.

Addressing Uncertainties in Potential Human Dietary Exposure to Mercury in the Watershed of the South River, Virginia, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						Beef; Consumption advisory; Human exposure; Mercury; Poultry; Wildlife	FISH CONSUMPTION; SOIL; RISK; POULTRY; LEGACY; WOMEN; MINE; MEAT; AGE	Much has been published about the harmful effects to humans when they are exposed to mercury (Hg) in environmental media including their diet. Numerous health advisories around the world, including for the South River, Virginia, USA, warn against consumption of Hg-contaminated fish species. Fewer studies have focused on other dietary sources of Hg and how to advise humans potentially exposed by this route. In undertaking a human health risk assessment for the former DuPont facility in Waynesboro, Virginia, USA, and the nearby South River and surrounding watershed, the available published information on Hg exposure through dietary consumption of nonfish items proved unsuitable for extrapolation purposes. In response, an evaluation of potential Hg exposure to residents who might consume livestock, poultry, and wildlife raised or collected in the South River watershed was conducted to inform the risk-assessment process. The newly collected data on Hg in these dietary items filled an important data gap, suggesting that there was little concern about limiting dietary consumption for most items. These results were communicated to the public through print and electronic platforms, in the form of "fact sheets." We describe the studies and actions taken to better explain the potential for human exposures to Hg in nonfish dietary items from a portion of the watershed of the South River.

This study aimed to investigate the enzymatic properties of serum alpha-galactosidase A (GLA) and compared them with the clinical parameters of PD. Methods: The study participants consisted of 66 sporadic PD patients and 52 controls. We measured serum GLA activity and calculated the apparent Michaelis constant (K-m) and maximal velocity (V-max) by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis. Serum GLA protein concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the potential correlations between serum GLA activity and GLA protein concentration and clinical features and the plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) level. Results: Compared to controls, PD patients showed significantly lower serum GLA activity (P < 0.0001) and apparent V-max (P = 0.0131), but no change in the apparent K-m value. Serum GLA protein concentration was lower in the PD group (P = 0.0168) and was positively associated with GLA activity. Serum GLA activity and GLA protein concentration in the PD group showed a negative correlation with age. Additionally, serum GLA activity was negatively correlated with the motor severity score and the level of plasma NfL, and was positively correlated with the score of frontal assessment battery. Interpretation: This study highlights that the lower serum GLA activity in PD is the result of a quantitative decrement of GLA protein in the serum and that it may serve as a biomarker of disease severity.

Supported tungsten oxide catalysts showed a moderate selectivity and activity compared to palladium and iron catalysts. The best performance in the selective oxidation of glucose among the studied catalysts was displayed by gold on alumina. For this kind of catalyst, the structure sensitivity in glucose oxidation was explored, revealing a maximum rate shifted to larger gold particle sizes at higher temperatures in comparison with other studies involving activation of molecular oxygen on gold particles. A significant change in the apparent activation energy was established while changing the particle size of gold. These changes of the activation energy were adequately explained by a theoretical model for the cluster size dependence of the apparent activation energy.

The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were used to find studies published until March 2023. Randomized controlled trials, healthy participants, and no use of other supplements. The search strategy was conducted by two independent reviewers, and specific information was extracted from the selected studies. Thirteen studies were included with 263 participants (198 men and 65 women between 18 and 65 years old). Two studies followed acute supplementation, 5 chronic, and 6 combined both. The results were heterogenous, having 11 studies with some positive effects, while 2 studies show no effect in variables such as rating of perceive exertion, heart rate, antioxidant capacity, blood lactate, creatine kinase, or C-reactive protein. Two limitations were found, firstly, the difference between supplementation and exercise protocols, and secondly, the existence of unclear or high risk of bias in most of the studies included. Acute supplementation with RR has a positive effect on endurance performance and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Chronic supplementation has a positive effect on anaerobic exercise performance, but not endurance exercise performance. Chronic supplementation may positively impact muscle damage during exercise. However, more high-quality studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of RR.	[Sanz-Barrio, Patricia M. M.] Univ Europea Madrid, Fac Sport Sci, Madrid, Spain; [Noreen, Eric E.

Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high-temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low-cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst support that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM-free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT-PEMFCs.

MethodsPubMed, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results from included studies were synthesized, and quantitative data on psychosocial impact were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. ResultsWe included 35 publications. Most personal stakeholders expressed interest in biomarker assessment. Learning negative biomarker results led to relief and sometimes frustration, while positive biomarkers induced anxiety but also clarity. Meta-analysis of five studies including 2012 participants (elevated amyloid = 1324 [66%], asymptomatic = 1855 [92%]) showed short-term psychological impact was not significant (random-effect estimate = 0.10, standard error = 0.23, P = 0.65). Most professional stakeholders valued biomarker testing, although attitudes and practices varied considerably. DiscussionInterest in AD biomarker testing was high and sharing their results did not cause psychological harm. HighlightsMost personal stakeholders expressed interest in Alzheimer's disease biomarker assessment.Personal motivations included gaining insight, improving lifestyle, or preparing for the future.There was no short-term psychological impact of sharing biomarker status, implying it can be safe.Most professional stakeholders valued biomarker testing, believing the benefits outweigh the risk.Harmonized guidelines on biomarker testing and sharing results are required.

The solid-state nanopore (SS nanopore) is a sensitive tool for detecting single molecules because of its unique label-free and low sample consumption properties. SS nanopore translocation of small biomolecules is typically driven by an electronic field force and is thus influenced by the charge, shape, and size of the target molecules. Therefore, it remains challenging to control the translocation of biomolecules through SS nanopores, particularly for different proteins with complex conformations and unique charges. Toward this problem, a DNA polyhedral carrier coating strategy to assist protein translocation through SS nanopores is developed, which facilitates target protein detection. The current signal-to-noise ratios are improved significantly using this DNA carrier loading strategy. The proposed method should aid the detection of proteins, which are difficult to translocate through nanopores. This coating-assisted method offers a wide range of applications for SS nanopore detection and promotes the development of single-molecule detection.

However, the effects of NSC-derived factors on glioma progression remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of human NSC-conditioned medium (NSC-CM) on the behaviour of glioma cells using an in vitro co-culture system. Cell counting kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays revealed that NSC-CM inhibited glioma cell proliferation and growth in a fetal bovine serum (FBS)-independent manner. In addition, our wound-healing assay demonstrated that NSC-CM repressed glioma cell migration, while results from transwell and 3D spheroid invasion assays indicated that NSC-CM also reduced the invasion capacity of glioma cells. Flow cytometry showed that NSC-CM prevented cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase and promoted apoptosis. Western blotting was used to show that the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related proteins, including beta-catenin, c-Myc, cyclin D1, CD44 and Met, was remarkably decreased in NSC-CM-treated glioma cells. Furthermore, the addition of a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator, CHIR99021, significantly induced the expression of beta-catenin and Met and increased the proliferative and invasive capabilities of control medium-treated glioma cells but not those of NSC-CM-treated glioma cells. The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) revealed the secretion of some antitumour factors in human and rat NSCs, including interferon-a and dickkopf-1. Our data suggest that NSC-CM partially inhibits glioma cell progression by downregulating Wnt/beta-catenin signalling. This study may serve as a basis for developing future antiglioma therapies based on NSC derivatives.

Here, we show that KEA1 and KEA2 are involved in vacuolar protein trafficking. Genetic analyses found that the kea1 kea2 mutants had short siliques, small seeds, and short seedlings. Molecular and biochemical assays showed that seed storage proteins were missorted out of the cell and the precursor proteins were accumulated in kea1 kea2. Protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) were smaller in kea1 kea2. Further analyses showed that endosomal trafficking in kea1 kea2 was compromised. Vacuolar sorting receptor 1 (VSR1) subcellular localizations, VSR-cargo interactions, and p24 distribution on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus were affected in kea1 kea2. Moreover, plastid stromule growth was reduced and plastid association with the endomembrane compartments was disrupted in kea1 kea2. Stromule growth was regulated by the cellular pH and K+ homeostasis maintained by KEA1 and KEA2. The organellar pH along the trafficking pathway was altered in kea1 kea2. Overall, KEA1 and KEA2 regulate vacuolar trafficking by controlling the function of plastid stromules via adjusting pH and K+ homeostasis.

Materials and methodsOne hundred and forty-three cases that lost the maxillary first molar were included, and their CBCT data during the edentulous period were obtained. Dentition models were reconstructed from CBCT, and superimpositions were performed, followed by measuring migration distances and calculating migration rates of antagonistic and distal neighboring teeth. Factors were analyzed using multivariate generalized estimating equations (GEE). ResultsThe mean migration distances were 208 & PLUSMN; 137 & mu;m and 403 & PLUSMN; 605 & mu;m for antagonistic teeth and distal teeth, and the mean migration rates were 26.8 & PLUSMN; 21.2 & mu;m/month and 48.5 & PLUSMN; 76.7 & mu;m/month, respectively. One hundred and nineteen out of 143 distal neighboring teeth migrated toward the edentulous site, and all antagonistic teeth migrated occlusally. Occlusal contact loss and chronic apical periodontitis both significantly accelerated antagonistic tooth migration (p < 0.05), the latter also accelerated distal tooth migration (p < 0.05). Besides, the displacement of the distal teeth was somewhat accelerated by the impacted adjacent third molar and root protrusion into the sinus. ConclusionsThe neighboring teeth tend to migrate toward the edentulous gap in the maxillary posterior region. Occlusal contact loss and chronic apical periodontitis are two significant risk factors for accelerating antagonistic tooth migration, and for distal teeth, chronic apical periodontitis is the risk factor. The impacted adjacent third molar and root protrusion into the sinus are also potential risk factors for accelerating the migration of the maxillary distal tooth. Thus, to prevent maxillary edentulous gap reduction, the factors mentioned above should be taken into consideration when planning treatment flow.

Micro-CT scans were performed after each instrument. Data were compared using a general linear mixed model post hoc comparisons with Kenward-Roger for Wald F tests (a = 5%). After each treatment step, it was observed an increase in the percentage volume of removed dentine and a decrease in the unprepared areas and dentine thickness at the pericervical region of all canals (p < 0.05). The percentage reduction of dentine thickness in MB2 canal was higher than in the mesiobuccal and distobuccal canals (p < 0.05). Knowledge of pre-operative dimensions and dentine thickness before enlargement of buccal canals of maxillary molars is an important factor to avoid excessive dentine removal.

Geomorphological habitat type drives variation in temporal species turnover but not temporal nestedness in Amazonian fish assemblages	OIKOS			English	Article; Early Access						community ecology; beta-deviation; beta-diversity; dispersal; flood pulse; null model	DIVERSITY; VARIABILITY; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DISTURBANCE; ABUNDANCE; DYNAMICS; RATES; LAKES	Explaining the mechanisms underlying spatial and temporal variation in community composition is a major challenge. Nevertheless, the processes controlling temporal variation at a site (i.e. temporal beta-diversity, including its turnover and nestedness components) are less understood than those affecting variation among sites (i.e. spatial beta-diversity). Short-term temporal turnover (e.g. throughout an annual cycle) is expected to correlate positively with seasonal environmental variability and landscape connectivity, but also species pool size (gamma-diversity). We use the megadiverse Amazonian freshwater ichthyofauna as a model to ask whether seasonality and landscape connectivity drive variation in temporal species turnover among geomorphological habitat types, while accounting for between-habitat variation in gamma-diversity. We collected 11 397 fish representing 260 species during a year-long sampling program from an area containing the lowland Amazon's four major geomorphological habitat types: rivers, floodplains, terra firme streams, and shield streams. River-floodplain systems exhibit strong but predictable seasonality (via a high-amplitude annual flood pulse), high connectivity, and high species richness with many rare species. Terra firme and shield streams exhibit low seasonality, low connectivity, and low species richness with proportionally fewer rare species. Based on these parameters we predicted that river-floodplain systems should have higher temporal turnover than stream systems. Using a null model approach combined with beta-deviation calculations, we confirmed that rivers and floodplains do exhibit higher turnover (but not nestedness) than terra firme and shield streams, even when controlling for the potentially confounding effect of higher species richness in river-floodplain systems. All habitats exhibit low temporal nestedness, indicating that short-term changes in community composition result primarily from temporal species turnover. Our results provide a timely reminder that efforts to conserve the Amazon's threatened aquatic biodiversity should account for the distinct temporal dynamics of habitat types and variation in hydrological seasonality.

Contrary to this narrative, we show that large cash reserves can have strong benefits for firms. Specifically, being cash-rich helps firms form more strategic partnerships because cash helps assure potential partners that the focal firm will be able to adapt to unfolding contingencies. This assurance is particularly relevant in industry conditions that make disruptions either more likely or more costly. We explain how such disruptions arise due to uncertainty about partners' behaviours and thereby extend the literature in the area of transaction cost economics by shifting the focus from intentional opportunism to encompass unintentional factors that can impede a firm's ability to honour partnership agreements. This shift highlights a beneficial role of excess cash that is often overshadowed by the popular narrative on its wastefulness.

The oil-water mobility law in reservoirs has not yet been completely determined, restricting the formulation of rational reservoir development methods. To bridge this gap, in this study, we used several test methods, such as casting thin sections, mercury intrusion, and nuclear magnetic resonance, to obtain the pore structure and oil-water displacement characteristics of tight carbonate reservoirs in the Western Qaidam Basin. The pore structures of the reservoirs could be categorized into three types: microfractures + dissolved pores + micropores (MFD), microfractures + micropores (MF), and matrix (M). The characteristics of single-phase oil seepage and water flooding in reservoirs with various pore structures differed evidently. For the MF- and M-types, the water-locking effect caused by the strong capillary force affected oil charging in the micropores. The effect of the pressure drop on the MFD-type algal limestone was less than that on the MF-type limestone (dolomite) because of the occurrence of a non-Darcy flow. The MFD-type, which contained microfractures, had preferential seepage channels, resulting in obvious fluid channeling and low water displacement efficiency. Oil(-)water displacement mainly occurred in the dissolved pores and microfractures, suggesting that starting oil accumulation in the micropores was crucial. This study will assist in efficient development of tight carbonate reservoirs in the Western Qaidam Basin.

The Role of Early Trauma in the Formation of Belief in Reptilian Conspiracy Theories: A Psychoanalytic Perspective	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY			English	Article; Early Access						PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY; PSYCHIC RETREAT; OVERVALUED IDEAS; CONSPIRACY THEORIES; REPTILIAN CONSPIRACY		This paper investigates whether conspiracy theories arising during the COVID-19 pandemic are linked to early trauma or a specific organization of the mind. Using the Reptilian conspiracy theory as an example, the paper proposes that belief in conspiracy theories can activate unresolved memories of trauma and serve as a mediator between the psyche and intrusive content. Classic psychoanalytic concepts, as well as more modern ideas from Britton and Steiner, are explored to understand the role of early trauma and inner object relations dynamics in the development of Belief in Reptilian Conspiracy Theories (BiCT). The concept of apres-coup is introduced to explain how newer responses to familiar psychic experiences may shape beliefs in conspiracies. Additionally, the paper proposes that belief in conspiracy theories can function as a psychic retreat. Two clinical cases are presented to illustrate these ideas while maintaining anonymity.

Different from traditional dual-mode patch filters, two higher-order modes TM020 and TM110 are utilised to generate a passband, and the two resonant frequencies can be controlled well by its radius and angle. A dual-mode filter with two transmission zeros (TZs) is implemented by using one FSPR, and locations of TZs can be controlled well. To further improve the selectivity of FSPR filters, four-pole filters based on two identical dual-mode FSPRs with co-directional and reverse-directional cascade are simulated, fabricated and measured. Furthermore, three- and four-pole filters based on dual-mode FSPR and single-mode uniform impedance resonators are proposed, which are also simulated, fabricated, and measured. The later proposed filters not only achieve high selectivity and wide stopband, but also have simple structure and small size.

Of 4013 patients, & SIM;15% had NELP. Preintervention, Chinese-preferring patients had a 5.6 percentage point higher probability of questions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08, 2.21) compared to English-preferring patients; Spanish-preferring and English-preferring patients had similar rates of questions. Postintervention, English-preferring and Spanish-preferring patients had no significant change; Chinese-preferring patients had a significant 10.9 percentage point decrease in the probability of questions (aOR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.69) thereby closing the disparity.

These studies provide valuable insights into the structure-reactivity/selectivity correlations via theoretical simulations and energy profile analysis. Alcohols, a category of molecules that are readily available from biomass and are low cost, represent one of the most extensively studied compounds in organic synthesis. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the DFT studies conducted since 2017 on the C-OH bond activation of alcohols catalyzed by transition metals. Specifically, the activation can be mainly divided into four categories: free radical cleavage, metal insertion, nucleophilic attack, and & beta;-OH elimination. We will also cover some promising strategies and give a perspective regarding future research directions in this field.

Improving phytase production in <i>Pichia pastoris</i> fermentations through de-repression and methanol induction optimization	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						bidirectional promoter; continuous culture; fed-batch; kinetic model	GROWTH-RATE; PROTEIN-PRODUCTION; EXPRESSION; THERMOSTABILITY; GENE; APPA; STABILITY; SECRETION; CULTURE; SITE	Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii) is a fast-growing methylotrophic yeast with the ability to assimilate several carbon sources such as methanol, glucose, or glycerol. It has been shown to have outstanding secretion capability with a variety of heterologous proteins. In previous studies, we engineered P. pastoris to co-express Escherichia coli AppA phytase and the HAC1 transcriptional activator using a bidirectional promoter. Phytase production was characterized in shake flasks and did not reflect industrial conditions. In the present study, phytase expression was explored and optimized using instrumented fermenters in continuous and fed-batch modes. First, the production of phytase was investigated under glucose de-repression in continuous culture at three dilution factors, 0.5 d(-1), 1 d(-1), and 1.5 d(-1). The fermenter parameters of these cultures were used to inform a kinetic model in batch and fed-batch modes for growth and phytase production. The kinetic model developed aided to design the glucose-feeding profile of a fed-batch culture. Kinetic model simulations under glucose de-repression and fed-batch conditions identified optimal phytase productivity at the specific growth rate of 0.041 h(-1). Validation of the model simulation with experimental data confirmed the feasibility of the model to predict phytase production in our newly engineered strain. Methanol was used only to induce the expression of phytase at high cell densities. Our results showed that high phytase production required two stages, the first stage used glucose under de-repression conditions to generate biomass while expressing phytase, and stage two used methanol to induce phytase expression. The production of phytase was improved 3.5-fold by methanol induction compared to the expression with glucose alone under de-repression conditions to a final phytase activity of 12.65 MU/L. This final volumetric phytase production represented an approximate 36-fold change compared to the flask fermentations. Finally, the phytase protein produced was assayed to confirm its molecular weight, and pH and temperature profiles. This study highlights the importance of optimizing protein production in P. pastoris when using novel promoters and presents a general approach to performing bioprocess optimization in this important production host.

However, there is only limited data regarding the eletrophysiological differences between the CTI- AFL in the postsurgical patients and the nonsurgical patients. HypothesisWe aimed to investigate the differences in clinical and electrophysiological characteristics between the postsurgical group and nonsurgical group and to evaluate the acute and long-term outcomes after ablation guided by robotic magnetic navigation (RMN) in both the groups. Methods Fourty-two consecutive patients with nonsurgical AFL and 21 with postsurgical AFL were retrospectively analyzed in our center. Electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis and three-dimensional electrophysiological study were performed in all the patients. ResultsThe results revealed that only 55.6% of postsurgical patients with proven counterclockwise (CCW) AFL presented with a typical ECG suggesting this mechanism. In contrast, 86.1% of nonsurgical patients demonstrated a typical ECG pattern for CCW AFL. In addition, we employed a reverse "U-curve" to facilitate radiofrequency delivery when ablating near the inferior vena cava ostium in the present study. Compared with the nonsurgical group, electroanatomical mapping showed the mean AFL cycle length was significantly longer (253.3 & PLUSMN; 40.4 vs. 234.1 & PLUSMN; 24.2 ms, p = 0.03) and the right atrium volume was larger (114.8 & PLUSMN; 26.0 vs. 97.5 & PLUSMN; 19.1 mL, p = 0.004) in the postsurgical group. Additionally, the procedural time (75.9 & PLUSMN; 21.3 vs. 61.6 & PLUSMN; 26.6 minutes, p = 0.03) and ablation time (53.0 & PLUSMN; 21.4 vs. 36.7 & PLUSMN; 25.6 minutes, p = 0.02) are much longer in the postsurgical group. However, the navigation index in the postsurgical group was significantly smaller (0.35 & PLUSMN; 0.08 vs. 0.43 & PLUSMN; 0.13, p = 0.01). Moreover, the acute and long-term success rates were comparable between the two groups. ConclusionsCatheter ablation of CTI-AFL with and without prior cardiac surgery guided by RMN are associated with high acute and long-term success rates, despite the procedural and ablation times are much longer in the postsurgical patients. However, ECG characteristics of the tachycardia may be misleading as they are more often atypical in patients after cardiac surgery.

MethodsThis was a retrospective chart review using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and Phoenix Children's Fetal Cardiology databases. We included all cases of CHD requiring surgery <1 year of age between 2013 and 2018. A total of 1137 patients met the criteria, and various demographic, socioeconomic, and patient outcome data were collected. ResultsThe overall PDR was 58% with an improving detection rate over the course of our study, with the final year having a PDR of 67%. Over time, PDR improved in urban communities, but this was not seen in rural communities. Rural address, public insurance, and Native American ethnicity were associated with lower PDR. Postnatal outcomes, including Apgars, initial pH, and lactate, did not differ with the presence of a prenatal diagnosis. Diagnoses typically identified with the outflow tract and 3-vessel views on the fetal echocardiogram were less likely to be detected prenatally. ConclusionsThe PDR of CHD continues to improve with evolving technologies and guidelines. We highlight a discrepancy between urban, rural, and Native American populations. Additionally, by supplying descriptors of missed diagnosis and associated echocardiography views, we hope to provide data for future interventions.

The study aimed to establish factors that influence GP's decision-making when referring a child with intellectual disabilities to the emergency department. MethodDiscrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used in health research to further understand complex decision making. A DCE was designed to assess the relative importance of factors that may influence a GP's (N = 157) decision to refer. ResultsA random parameters model indicated that perceived limited parental capacity to manage an illness was the most important factor in the decision to refer a child to the ED, followed by a repeat visit, a referral request from the parent, and a Friday afternoon appointment. ConclusionUnderstanding the factors that influence referral is important for service improvement and to strengthen primary care provision for this population and their families.

In this introductory article, the first of the Journal's special issue dedicated to REACT, our goal was to present the project rationale, its methodology, training and certification of the team, statistical approach, quality control, governance, and study management. MethodsWe sampled 1000 children (6-10 years of age) from 25 of the 32 primary schools in Matosinhos, northern Portugal. The protocol included a set of variables clustered around the child (growth, physical fitness, fundamental movement skills, and health behaviors), family (demographics, socioeconomic status, parental support for sports participation and physical activity), school (policies and practices for health behaviors, infrastructure for physical education and sports practices), and neighborhood and home environments (safety, sidewalks, sports facilities, as well as children electronic devices and play equipment at home). A set of standard protocols were implemented in REACT together with a rigorous system of training and certification of all members of the research team. This was complemented with a pilot study to assess, in loco, the quality of data acquisition, data entry, and control. DiscussionResults from REACT will provide school administrators and teachers with novel and far-reaching information related to children's growth and motor development as well as health behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic. It will also provide city-hall education officials with insight regarding children's physical fitness, fundamental movement skills, and sports practices that will be of great importance in devising novel intervention programs to increase health-enhancing physical activity, and combat sedentariness and obesity. Finally, it will offer parents a wealth of information regarding their children's growth, motor development, and health.

This article sheds light on the degree of horizontal legal coherence between the main EU legal and policy instruments applicable to the protection of water resources from agricultural pollution. After identifying key coherence challenges at the EU level, the article thoroughly assesses the regulatory and governance approach in Norway. The key question is how certain EU-level coherence challenges could be mitigated at a national level through mechanisms aimed at facilitating cross-sectoral coordination and policy coherence. Three types of mechanisms have been selected for this purpose: (i) legal mechanisms, including cross-referencing and joint institutional responsibility for implementation; (ii) the establishment of platforms for cross-sectoral policy coordination or actor participation; and (iii) the establishment of monitoring and reporting processes that ensure access to information and data sharing.

It has also shown potential as an anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic agent. However, its specific role in inhibiting angiogenesis in breast cancer is not well understood. Objectives: We aimed to investigate the anti-angiogenesis effect of DHA on breast cancer and explore its potential as a therapeutic drug. Our objectives were to assess the impact of DHA on neovascularization induced by MDA-MB-231 cells, evaluate its effects on vessel sprout and tube-formation in vascular endothelial cells, and analyze the expression of key angiogenesis-related proteins. Methods: Using a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, we cultured MDA-MB-231 cells and treated them with DHA. We assessed neovascularization and cultured vascular endothelial cells with DHA-treated cell media to evaluate vessel sprout and tube-formation. Protein expression levels of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were analyzed using Western blotting. Results: DHA significantly attenuated neovascularization induced by MDAMB-231 cells. It also suppressed vessel sprout and tube-formation of HUVEC cells when exposed to DHA-treated cell media. Furthermore, DHA downregulated the expression of VEGF, MMP-2, and MMP-9 proteins. Mechanistically, DHA inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, ERK, and NF-.B proteins in tumor cells. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of the inhibitory effect of DHA on breast cancer angiogenesis. These findings support the potential of DHA as an anti-breast cancer drug and warrant further investigation for its therapeutic applications.

Upper limits for road salt pollution in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access							FRESH-WATER; SALINIZATION; SALINITY; INCREASE; IMPACTS	Widespread and increasing use of road deicing salt is a major driver of increasing lake chloride concentrations, which can negatively impact aquatic organisms and ecosystems. We used a simple model to explore the controls on road salt concentrations and predict equilibrium concentrations in lakes across the contiguous United States. The model suggests that equilibrium salt concentration depends on three quantities: salt application rate, road density, and runoff (precipitation minus evapotranspiration). High application combined with high road density leads to high equilibrium salt concentrations regardless of runoff. Yet if application can be held at current rates or reduced, concentrations in many lakes situated in lightly to moderately urbanized watersheds should equilibrate at levels below currently recommended thresholds. In particular, our model predicts that, given 2010-2015 road salt application rates, equilibrium chloride concentrations in the contiguous United States will exceed the current regulatory chronic exposure threshold of 230 mg L-1 in over 2000 lakes; will exceed 120 mg L-1 in over 9000 lakes; and will be below 120 mg L-1 in hundreds of thousands of lakes. Our analysis helps to contextualize current trends in road salt pollution of lakes, and suggests that stabilization of equilibrium chloride concentrations below thresholds designed to protect aquatic organisms should be an achievable goal.

In contrast to existing 2D or 3D infinite graphene structures, an intrinsic graphene 3D finite structure with periodicity in all three directions is designed. At the matching point, where the dispersion curve of the intrinsic graphene plasmons intersects with that of electromagnetic radiation, the intrinsic graphene plasmons and electromagnetic radiation can be excited by each other; in other words, the plasmon can be excited by light without additional mechanisms. Furthermore, the influence of environment temperature on the matching point is shown. The study reveals that the plasmon modulation is adaptive to the temperature. These results are beneficial for the design of compact graphene-based optoelectronic devices.

AimsThe primary objective of our study was to describe the use of preemptive anticoagulation from the emergency department (ED) or inpatient wards stratified by risk assessment score. MethodsWe performed a retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for investigation of PE. Patients were classified as either ED patients or hospital ward patients based on where the CTPA was requested. The pretest risk of PE was calculated using the Revised Geneva Score (RGS) and patients were divided into low and intermediate to high risk. ResultsA total of 392 consecutive patients who underwent CTPA at Monash Health were reviewed. There were 108 (27.6%) patients who were categorised as low risk (RGS 0-3) and 284 (72.4%) categorised as intermediate to high risk (RGS >3). There were 29 (7.4%) patients overall who received preemptive anticoagulation. Diagnostic yield of CTPA in the ED was low, with only four of 144 (2.8%) CTPA scans positive for PE. The yield of CTPA was higher in ward patients, with 63 of 248 (25.4%) being diagnostic of PE. ConclusionsThe use of preemptive anticoagulation for suspected PE was uncommon and was not influenced by the pretest probability of PE as determined by a validated clinical prediction tool. This may reflect concerns regarding haemorrhagic complications without any clear evidence of benefit. Diagnostic yield of CTPA performed in the ED was low.

The present study aimed to identify soybean genotypes resistant to CPMMV through mechanical inoculation-based phenotyping and marker trait association using gene-specific and simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A set of 500 soybean genotypes was initially screened in the field for CPMMV infection, of which 288 genotypes showing resistance were evaluated further under controlled glasshouse conditions. Among these 288 genotypes, 43 (14.9%) were resistant, 59 (20.5%) were moderately resistant while the remaining 186 (64.6%) were susceptible. A set of five gene-specific primer pairs, three of which targeted CPMMV R genes, was used for screening the 288 soybean genotypes; 96 genotypes from the 288 (based on disease score) were also genotyped with 24 SSR polymorphic markers for an association study. The mean values of major allele frequency and gene diversity were found to be 0.70 and 0.39, respectively. The polymorphism information content varied from 0.14 to 0.37. Population structure and cluster analysis revealed three subpopulations for the five gene-specific markers and two distinct subpopulations for the 24 SSR markers, respectively. Neighbour joining-based clustering analysis categorized the 288 genotypes into two major clusters. Three markers were found to be significantly associated with CPMMV resistance. The BARCSOYSSR0558 marker showed the highest phenotypic variance of 9.6%. The present study will help in identification of CPMMV R genes and breeding new resistant varieties through marker-assisted selection.

Here, a high curvature PEDOT:PSS transport layer is demonstrated via the self-assembly island-like structures by the incorporation of alkali metal salts. Benefiting from the dielectric confinement effect of the high curvature surface, the modified CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs present a 2.1 times peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) from 6.75% to 14.23% and a 3.3 times half lifetime (T-50) from 3.96 to 13.01 h. Besides, the PeLEDs show high luminance up to 44834 cd m(-2). Evidently, this work may provide a deep insight into the structure-activity relationship between the micro-structures at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface and the performance of PeLEDs, and crack the codes for ameliorating the performance of PeLEDs via interfacial micro-structured regulation.

A major challenge, however, is how to break the cost-efficiency trade-off. Here, a novel defect engineering strategy is presented to construct a nanoporous (FeCoNiB0.75)(97)Pt-3 (atomic %) high-entropy metallic glass (HEMG) with a nanocrystalline surface structure that contains large amounts of lattice distortion and stacking faults to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance using only 3 at% of Pt. The defect-rich HEMG achieves ultralow overpotentials at ampere-level current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) for HER (104 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (301 mV) under alkaline conditions, while retains a long-term durability exceeding 200 h at 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it only requires 81 and 122 mV to drive the current densities of 1000 and 100 mA cm(-2) for HER under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively. Modelling results reveal that lattice distortion and stacking fault defects help to optimize atomic configuration and modulate electronic interaction, while the surface nanoporous architecture provides abundant active sites, thus synergistically contributing to the reduced energy barrier for water electrolysis. This defect engineering approach combined with a HEMG design strategy is expected to be widely applicable for development of high-performance alloy catalysts.

Family income uniquely related to a self-regulation latent factor (beta =.22), and parent-child Chinese orientation gaps were associated with parent-reported effortful control (beta =.40). Self-regulation at W1 negatively predicted parent-and teacher-reported behavioral maladjustment (beta s = -.22 and -.48) at W2, controlling for cross-time stability of both constructs and covariates (child sex, parental education).

Solar-powered sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting technology is a promising solution in this category. The main challenge is to design materials with high water harvesting performance while achieving fast water vapor adsorption/desorption rates. Here, a superhydrophilic photothermic hollow nanocapsule (SPHN) is represented that achieves efficient atmospheric water harvesting in outdoor climates. In SPHN, the hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) is grafted with polypyrrole (PPy) and also loaded with lithium chloride (LiCl). The hollow structure is used to store water while preventing leakage. The hydrophilic spherical nanocapsule and the trapped water produce more free and weakly adsorbed water. Significantly lower the heat of desorption compared to pure LiCl solution. Such SPHN significantly improves the adsorption/desorption kinetics, e.g., absorbs 0.78-2.01 g of water per gram of SPHN at 25 & DEG;C, relative humidity (RH) 30-80% within 3 h. In particular, SPHN has excellent photothermal properties to achieve rapid water release under natural sunlight conditions, i.e., 80-90% of water is released in 1 h at 0.7-1.0 kW m(-2) solar irradiation, and 50% of water is released even at solar irradiation as low as 0.4 kW m(-2). The water collection capacity can reach 1.2 g g(-1) per cycle by using the self-made atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) device. This finding provides a way to design novel materials for efficient water harvesting tasks, e.g., water engineering, freshwater generator, etc.	[Han, Xuefeng; Zhong, Lieshuang; Zhang, Lei; Zhu, Lingmei; Zhou, Maolin; Wang, Shaomin; Yu, Dongdong; Chen, Huan; Hou, Yongping; Zheng, Yongmei] Beihang Univ BUAA, Minist Educ, Sch Chem, Key Lab Bioinspired Smart Interfacial Sci & Techno, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China	Beihang University	Zheng, YM (corresponding author), Beihang Univ BUAA, Minist Educ, Sch Chem, Key Lab Bioinspired Smart Interfacial Sci & Techno, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.	zhengym@buaa.edu.cn			National Natural Science Foundation of China [22275008]	National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))	Acknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (22275008).		56	0	0	28	28	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1613-6810	1613-6829		SMALL	Small	2023 JUL 24	2023										10.1002/smll.202303358	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.202303358		JUL 2023	9	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics	M7RU8	37488688				2023-10-18	WOS:001032161100001

The production region directly affects the composition of flavor substances and quality of baijiu. However, identification of baijiu region is challenging because the corresponding relationship between the production region and baijiu quality is not clear, and the identification of regionalmarkers is indeterminate. In this study, the differences in volatile components of sauce-aroma style baijiu from four representative regions were investigated. ResultsA total of 94 volatile compounds were identified in samples tested. Additionally, it was verified that 35 potential flavor substances had important contributions to the aroma of sauce-aroma style baijiu. Meanwhile, nine potential regionalmarkers were screened through multivariate analysis. Further, based on distribution of volatile compounds and the results of sensory evaluation combined with multivariate analysis, a molecular matrix and correlation network were established according to the results of addition experiments, which showed that six substances had a significant impact on the flavor of the tested samples. ConclusionSix key flavor substances (ethyl octanoate, ethyl 2-methylpropanoate, propyl acetate, ethyl heptanoate, 2-nonanone and butyl hexanoate) were considered as important regionalmarkers to effectively identify the production region of sauce-aroma style baijiu. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

J	Keremedis, K; Tachtsis, E				Keremedis, Kyriakos; Tachtsis, Eleftherios			On Hausdorff operators in ZF$\mathsf {ZF}$	MATHEMATICAL LOGIC QUARTERLY			English	Article; Early Access							WEAK FORMS; AXIOM	A Hausdorff space (X,T)$(X,\mathcal {T})$ is called effectively Hausdorff if there exists a function F-called a Hausdorff operator-such that, for every x,y & ISIN;X$x,y\in X$ with x & NOTEQUAL;y$x\ne y$, F(x,y)=(U,V)$F(x,y)=(U,V)$, where U and V are disjoint open neighborhoods of x and y, respectively. Among other results, we establish the following in ZF$\mathsf {ZF}$, i.e., in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC$\mathsf {AC}$):AC$\mathsf {AC}$ is equivalent to "For every set X, the Cantor cube 2X$\mathbf {2}<^>{X}$ is effectively Hausdorff". This enhances the result of Howard, Keremedis, Rubin and Rubin [13] that AC$\mathsf {AC}$ is equivalent to "Hausdorff spaces are effectively Hausdorff" in ZF$\mathsf {ZF}$.The Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem and the statement "For every infinite set X, the Stone space S(X)$S(X)$ of the Boolean algebra P(X)$\wp (X)$ is effectively Hausdorff" are mutually independent. In particular, the latter statement is not provable in ZF$\mathsf {ZF}$.The Axiom of Choice for non-empty subsets of R$\mathbb {R}$ (AC(R)$\mathsf {AC}(\mathbb {R})$) is equivalent to each of "Separable Hausdorff spaces are effectively Hausdorff" and "The Cantor cube 2R$\mathbf {2}<^>{\mathbb {R}}$ is effectively Hausdorff".The Principle of Dependent Choices in conjunction with the Axiom of Choice for continuum sized families of non-empty subsets of R$\mathbb {R}$ does not imply the axiom of choice for partitions of R$\mathbb {R}$. The latter independence result fills the gap in information in Howard and Rubin's book "Consequences of the Axiom of Choice".The axiom of countable choice for non-empty subsets of R$\mathbb {R}$ is equivalent to each of "Denumerable Hausdorff spaces are effectively Hausdorff", "Denumerable T-3 spaces are completely normal" and "Denumerable Tychonoff spaces are Urysohn".(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)	[Keremedis, Kyriakos] Univ Aegean, Dept Math, Athina, Greece; [Tachtsis, Eleftherios] Univ Aegean, Dept Stat & Actuarial Financial Math, Karlovassi 83200, Samos, Greece	University of Aegean	Tachtsis, E (corresponding author), Univ Aegean, Dept Stat & Actuarial Financial Math, Karlovassi 83200, Samos, Greece.	ltah@aegean.gr							31	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	0942-5616	1521-3870		MATH LOGIC QUART	Math.

New approaches adopting computer vision technology hold serious potential to capture interactions and associations between individuals in video at large scale; however, such approaches need a priori validation, as methods of sampling and defining edges for social networks can substantially impact results.Here, we apply a deep learning face recognition model to generate association networks of wild chimpanzees using 17 years of a video archive from Bossou, Guinea. Using 7 million detections from 100 h of video footage, we examined how varying the size of fixed temporal windows (i.e. aggregation rates) for defining edges impact individual-level gregariousness scores.The highest and lowest aggregation rates produced divergent values, indicating that different rates of aggregation capture different association patterns. To avoid any potential bias from false positives and negatives from automated detection, an intermediate aggregation rate should be used to reduce error across multiple variables. Individual-level network-derived traits were highly repeatable, indicating strong inter-individual variation in association patterns across years and highlighting the reliability of the method to capture consistent individual-level patterns of sociality over time. We found no reliable effects of age and sex on social behaviour and despite a significant drop in population size over the study period, individual estimates of gregariousness remained stable over time.We believe that our automated framework will be of broad utility to ethology and conservation, enabling the investigation of animal social behaviour from video footage at large scale, low cost and high reproducibility. We explore the implications of our findings for understanding variation in sociality patterns in wild ape populations. Furthermore, we examine the trade-offs involved in using face recognition technology to generate social networks and sociality measures. Finally, we outline the steps for the broader deployment of this technology for analysis of large-scale datasets in ecology and evolution.

Iron-Catalyzed Alkoxylation, Dehydrogenative-Polymerization and Tandem Hydrosilylative-Alkoxylation	CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						alkoxylation; dehydrogenative polymerization; earth abundant catalysts; hydrosilylative-alkoxylation; iron catalyst	CROSS-DEHYDROCOUPLING POLYMERIZATION; POLY(SILYL ETHER)S; SILANE ALCOHOLYSIS; COMPLEXES; PH; DERIVATIVES; CHEMISTRY; MECHANISM; POLYMERS; RU	Alkoxylation, hydrosilylative-alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative-polymerization are some of the most widely used transformations in synthetic chemistry. However, these transformations are traditionally catalyzed by precious, and rare late-transition metals. Presented here is a molecularly defined iron complex that catalyzes alkoxylation, tandem hydrosilylative-alkoxylation, and dehydrogenative polymerization of silanes under mild conditions. The iron complex [Fe(CO)(4)(H)(SiPh3)] 1 catalyzes a direct Si-O coupling reaction between an array of silanes and alcohols to produce desired alkoxysilanes in excellent yield, with H-2 as the only byproduct. The iron catalyst tolerates various functional groups and provides access to 20 alkoxysilanes, including essential molecules such as & beta;-citronellol and cholesterol. Further, complex 1 catalyzes the polymerization of renewable diol and silane monomer to produce a renewable and degradable poly(isosorbide-silyl ether). Remarkably, complex 1 catalyzes a tandem hydrosilylative-alkoxylation of alkynes under mild conditions to yield unsaturated silyl ethers. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated by gram-scale alkoxylation and hydrosilylative-alkoxylation reactions.

The 2022 EULAR/ACR Points to Consider at the Early Stages of Diagnosis and Management of Suspected Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS)	ARTHRITIS & RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							NERVOUS-SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT; JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS; CAMPAIGN INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; CLINICAL-FEATURES; CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA; LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; SEPTIC SHOCK; ADULTS	Objective. Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) are life-threatening systemic hyperinflammatory syndromes that can develop in most inflammatory contexts. They can progress rapidly, and early identification and management are critical for preventing organ failure and mortality. This effort aimed to develop evidence-based and consensus-based points to consider to assist clinicians in optimising decision-making in the early stages of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of HLH/MAS. Methods. A multinational, multidisciplinary task force of physician experts, including adult and paediatric rheumatologists, haematologist/oncologists, immunologists, infectious disease specialists, intensivists, allied healthcare professionals and patients/parents, formulated relevant research questions and conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). Delphi methodology, informed by SLR results and questionnaires of experts, was used to generate statements aimed at assisting early decision-making and optimising the initial care of patients with HLH/MAS. Results. The task force developed 6 overarching statements and 24 specific points to consider relevant to early recognition of HLH/MAS, diagnostic approaches, initial management and monitoring of HLH/MAS. Major themes included the simultaneous need for prompt syndrome recognition, systematic evaluation of underlying contributors, early intervention targeting both hyperinflammation and likely contributors, careful monitoring for progression/complications and expert multidisciplinary assistance. Conclusion. These 2022 EULAR/American College of Rheumatology points to consider provide up-to-date guidance, basedonthebest availablepublished dataandexpertopinion. Theyaremeanttohelpguide the initial evaluation, management andmonitoring of patientswithHLH/MAS in order to halt disease progression and prevent life-threatening immunopathology.

Recently, melatonin has been shown to enhance plant resistance to aphids; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, our results showed that melatonin, MeJA, and H2S enhanced aphid resistance of watermelon in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by increases in the defense-related enzyme activities and lignin accumulation. On the plants pretreated with 100 & mu;M melatonin, 100 & mu;M MeJA, and 50 & mu;M NaHS, the numbers of aphids were 86.0%, 59.6%, and 47.9% lower than that on control plants, respectively, after aphid infestation for 7 days. Melatonin application induced MeJA and H2S accumulation in response to aphid infestation, while inhibition of MeJA and H2S accumulation attenuated or abolished melatonin-induced defense response and aphid resistance, suggestive of the involvement of MeJA and H2S in melatonin-induced aphid resistance. MeJA also increased H2S accumulation, but inhibition of MeJA biosynthesis prevented melatonin-enhanced H2S accumulation, suggesting that MeJA mediates melatonin-induced H2S accumulation. Furthermore, inhibition of H2S production attenuated MeJA-induced defense response and aphid resistance. Taken together, the current study reveals a novel mechanism in which MeJA-dependent H2S signaling is involved in melatonin-induced defense response and subsequent aphid resistance. The increasing concern to minimize the use of pesticides and to switch onto sustainable and natural control strategies indicates the great exploitation of such a mechanism in combating aphids.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of estradiol (Es) on stress and effect of stress on spatial working memory (WM) and also to investigate electroencephalogram (EEG) signal's dynamics in the early and late follicular (EF and LF) and luteal (LU) phases of unmarried girls' menstrual cycle. MethodsStress was induced by presentation of a short (3 min) movie clip. Simultaneous with a memory test and stress induction, EEG, serum Es levels, and galvanic skin response (GSR) were assessed. ResultsSerum Es concentrations were decreased in LF, LU, and EF phases. The mean GSR score decreased after stress induction in all three phases, but it increased in the LF and LU phases versus the EF phase. Spatial WM diminished after stress induction in all three phases, but it increased in the LF phase versus the two phases before and after stress induction. Average power spectrum density in all frequency bands increased after stress induction in the frontal and prefrontal channels in the spatial WM test. ConclusionThe results showed that stress led to spatial WM dysfunction; however, Es improved spatial WM performance in the LF phase versus the other two phases.

In addition, suggestions from participants are provided. Although informational support is crucial in the peripartum period, it is often inadequate or biased. Qualitative research, which offers a nuanced and patient-centered perspective, is limited. The qualitive research that does exist is limited to the prenatal period only, neglecting perspectives throughout the entire peripartum period. MethodsThis qualitative descriptive study was part of a larger observational cross-sectional study of postpartum individuals in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2017. Two years after the initial study (2019), participants were recruited into 8 focus groups. Trained facilitators guided focus group conversations using semistructured interview questions. The questions centered on overall experiences with perinatal outpatient health care experiences and informational support. Thematic analyses were used in data analysis. Interrater reliability between coders ranged from 92% to 100%. ResultsFifty-four individuals (22.1% response rate) participated in a total of 12 focus groups. The overarching theme was the need for recognition of individuality of patients. Three subthemes emerged, including time, multiple modalities of information support, and agency. DiscussionThis study extended previous qualitative findings across the entire peripartum period and that individualized prenatal care is an important distinction in perceived quality of care. Health care organizations should consider allocating time differently for perinatal office visits, offer flexible visit times based on individualized needs, offer information in multiple modalities, and promote agency of patients. This study was strengthened by the community involvement, women of color only focus groups, and oversampling of Black women. This study was limited by the self-selected, homogenous sample and potential for recall bias.

Using a supply-chain sample of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2009 to 2020, we find that suppliers' investment inefficiency is positively associated with their customers' stock price crash risk. Moreover, the impact of customers' stock price crash risk is more pronounced for suppliers with lower investment efficiency, weaker bargaining power, weaker innovation capability, and fewer investment opportunities. Our results suggest that information asymmetry along supply chains deteriorates the investment decision making of upstream firms from the perspective of capital market.

Delta waves, which are somewhat higher in frequency and lower in amplitude compared to SOs, and their interaction with spindles have only recently been found to play a critical role in memory processing of rodents, through a competitive interaction between SO-spindle and delta-spindle coupling. However, human studies that comprehensively address delta wave interactions with spindles and SOs, as well as their functional role for memory are still lacking. Electroencephalographic data were acquired across three naps of 33 healthy older human participants (17 female) to investigate delta-spindle coupling and the interplay between delta- and SO-related activity. Additionally, we determined intra-individual stability of coupling measures and their potential link to the ability to form novel memories in a verbal memory task. Our results revealed weaker delta-spindle compared to SO-spindle coupling. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found no evidence for an opposing dependency between SO- and delta-related activities during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, the ratio between SO- and delta-nested spindles rather than SO-spindle and delta-spindle coupling measures by themselves predicted the ability to form novel memories best. In conclusion, our results do not confirm previous findings in rodents on competitive interactions between delta activity and SO-spindle coupling in older adults.

It also compares the degrees of correlation between French and Chinese, considered respectively as a subject-prominent and a topic-prominent language. Kendall's correlation tests, Poisson models and z-tests were conducted using manually annotated textual data. The results confirm a positive correlation between STs and DTs in both languages. Although the correlation coefficients are higher in Chinese, z-tests' results do not show a significant difference between the two languages. We explain that the two languages differ not only in the more or less frequent topic-comment constructions, but also in the choice of more or less accessible referential markers which represent the STs, or in the more or less tacit way that STs of different sentences are related to each other.

Herein, this challenge is addressed by utilizing a Natrium super ionic conductor (NASICON) NASICON-type solid electrolyte, enabling the operation of a rechargeable SSNMB over a wide temperature range from -20 to 45 & DEG;C. The interfacial resistance at the Na metal/SE interface is only 0.4 & omega; cm(2) at 45 & DEG;C and remains below 110 & omega; cm(2) even at -20 & DEG;C. Remarkably, long-term Na-metal plating/stripping cycles lasting over 2000 h at -20 & DEG;C are achieved with minimal polarization voltages at 0.1 mA cm(-2). Further analysis reveals the formation of a uniform Na3-xCaxPO4 interphase layer at the interface, which significantly contributes to the exceptional interfacial performance observed. By employing a Na3V1.5Al0.5(PO4)(3) cathode, the full battery system demonstrates excellent adaptability to low temperatures, exhibiting a capacity of 80 mA h g(-1) at -20 & DEG;C over 50 cycles and retaining a capacity of 108 mAh g(-1) (88.5% of the capacity at 45 & DEG;C) at 0 & DEG;C over 275 cycles. This research significantly reduces the temperature threshold for SSNMB operation and paves the way toward solid-state batteries suitable for all-season applications.

The role of surgery after failed medical management is not well defined. Mucosal contact points and restricted airflow often perpetuate decongestant use. This study assessed the long-term outcomes of nasal surgery in patients with refractory RM. MethodsA prospective cohort study of refractory RM treated with nasal surgery was performed with & GE;12 months follow-up. Refractory RM was defined as nasal decongestant use once per day continuously for & GE;4 weeks despite medical therapy. Patients with concomitant sinus disease and nonrhinitis conditions were excluded. Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT22), Nasal Symptom Score (NSS), and nasal medication use were assessed. Patients who ceased decongestants were compared with ongoing users. ResultsA total of 56 patients (age 48.4 [5.0] years, 50% female) were assessed. Median follow-up was 3.4(1.6-6.2) years. Total cessation of decongestants was achieved in 91.1%, while 5.4% had intermittent use, and 3.6% reported daily use. Ongoing users had higher odds of concomitant asthma (40.0% vs. 3.9%; odds ratio [OR], 16.33 [1.7-159.75]; p = 0.036), reduced symptom improvement (& UDelta;SNOT22, -4.6 [15.7] vs. 27.1 [17], p = 0.009 and & UDelta;NSS, -1.0 [4.2] vs. -6.6 [5.1], p = 0.025), and greater ongoing use of nasal corticosteroid (60.0% vs. 5.9%; OR 24.0 [2.8-203.1]) and saline sprays (40% vs. 3.9%; OR 16.3 [1.7-159.8]) but showed no difference in allergy status (OR, 0.7[0.1-7.1]), previous surgery (OR, 1.0[0.1-10.2]), gastroesophageal reflux (OR 1.0[0.1-10.2], or underlying anxiety/depression (OR 6.1[0.8-45.9]) compared with those who ceased. ConclusionSurgically re-establishing a nasal airway was associated with long-term decongestant cessation and symptom improvement in medically refractory RM.

CircRNA PR/SET domain 5 (circ_PRDM5, hsa_circ_0005654) was downregulated in breast cancer (BC) tissues. This study is designed to investigate the functional mechanism of circ_PRDM5 in BC. Ultrasound examinations were performed to evaluate BC patients and normal individuals. Circ_PRDM5, miR-25-3p, and Ankyrin repeat domain 46 (ANKRD46) level detection was carried out by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used for cell viability examination. Cell proliferation was evaluated by ethynyl-2 & PRIME;-deoxyuridine assay and colony formation assay. The protein levels were examined using western blot. Cell migration and invasion abilities were assessed via transwell assay. Target interaction was analyzed via dual-luciferase reporter assay. The role of circ_PRDM5 in vivo was explored via xenograft tumor assay. Circ_PRDM5 expression was downregulated in BC tissues and cells. Overexpression of circ_PRDM5 suppressed proliferation and motility but enhanced apoptosis of BC cells. Circ_PRDM5 served as a sponge of miR-25-3p. Circ_PRDM5 impeded BC cell malignant development via sponging miR-25-3p. Circ_PRDM5 induced ANKRD46 upregulation by targeting miR-25-3p. Inhibition of miR-25-3p retarded BC progression by increasing the ANKRD46 level. Circ_PRDM5 repressed BC tumorigenesis in vivo through mediating the miR-25-3p/ANKRD46 axis. This study evidenced that circ_PRDM5 inhibited cell progression and tumor growth in BC via interacting with mir-25-3p/ANKRD46 network.

All synthesized compounds (NPD 1-14) molecular structure was confirmed by their FTIR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The final target compounds were screened for their in vitro antiproliferative activity by taking 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) as a reference drug. Among 14 newly synthesized compounds, five compounds were shown to be effectively cytotoxic against the MCF7 cells. In comparison to the standard medication drug 5-FU (CC50 = 11.219 & PLUSMN; 0.847), the synthesized compounds NPD-8 (CC50 = 16.14 & PLUSMN; 2.08 & mu;M) and NPD-12 (CC50 = 11.26 & PLUSMN; 1.158 & mu;M) demonstrated the most active against the MCF7 cells. Furthermore, in silico study was performed to find molecular level interaction of active compounds with anticancer drug target enzyme NUDT5 inhibitors block hormone signaling in breast cancer cells. The compound NPD-12 showed the highest molecular binding energy -8.3 kcal/mol which interacted more effectively than the reference drug 5-FU binding energy -4.6 kcal/mol. These synthesized N-(1,3-dioxoisoindolin-4-yl) acetamide derivatives have been identified as a potential class of chemicals for further research as plausible new anticancer entities.

A complete understanding of the properties of this quasi-particle is crucial to fully exploit the tremendous potential of 2D perovskites (2DP) in light emission applications. Despite intense investigations, some of the exciton properties remain elusive to date, for example, the energy-ordering of the exciton states within the so-called fine structure manifold. Using optical spectroscopy, it demonstrates that in the archetypical 2DP (PEA)(2)PbI4, in contradiction to theoretical predictions, the energy of the bright out-of-plane exciton state is higher than that of two in-plane states. Having elucidated the order of exciton fine structure, it determines the g-factor of the dark exciton transition, together with the values of the electron and hole g-factors in the direction parallel to the c-axis of the crystal. In this way, it provides for the first time, a complete picture of the exciton fine structure in (PEA)(2)PbI4 2DP.

J	Sher, A; Mazhar, S; Qiu, YZ				Sher, Ali; Mazhar, Saman; Qiu, Yuzhuo			Toward sustainable agriculture: The impact of interest-free credit on marketing decisions and technological progress in Pakistan	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						interest-free credit; market arbitrage; market participation; sustainable development; sustainable finance; sustainable rural income	MOBILE PHONES; FARMERS; PARTICIPATION; ACCESS; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION; EASTERN	Farm credit plays an essential role in fostering agricultural productivity. In smallholder agriculture, it aims to provide financial cushion and improve market outcomes leading to improved resource distribution, thus maximizing social and economic returns. In Pakistan, about 90% of farmers are smallholders with the least access to formal financial services. This study explores the impact of sustainable finance-interest-free credit (IFC)-on smallholders' marketing decisions, producer prices, and technological progress. It explains how liquidity constraints affect itinerant market (primary and secondary) participation and how smallholders get trapped in classical credit bondage with village-level moneylender-cum-traders and do not take advantage of temporal and spatial arbitrage. We use cross-sectional data from 637 farm households in Punjab-Pakistan. The results show that interest-free credit provision and village-level credit density improve smallholders' level of current and future market participation and increase the producer prices for rice and wheat. The results indicate that sustainable finance improves the vertical linkages between smallholder producers and markets, increasing sustainable supply response and farmers' income. Further, the results show that IFC provision improves technological progress by enhancing the uptake of modern crop varieties, improving cultural operations, and promoting sustainable crop residue management. The findings advocate the interplay between sustainable finance, smallholders' market integration and income earning and provide coherent insights for policymaking. The study suggests mechanisms to improve broader coverage of sustainable finance for breaking the semi-subsistence-oriented farming systems, improving technological progress and realizing sustainable development goals, like rural poverty reduction and improved food production and distribution in developing countries.

While several studies have investigated risk factors for IC onset, few have assessed the risk factors for recurrent IC. This study aimed to identify risk factors for recurrent IC. MethodsPotential risk factors for recurrence were assessed by examining medical records and laboratory findings in this single-center retrospective study. We extracted the following data from the patients' medical records: patient characteristics, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, method of treatment, length of hospital stay, disease course, and the frequency of IC morbidities. Patients with IC were selected from a total of 439 312 patients over an 11-year period. Patients were divided into recurrent and nonrecurrent IC groups. ResultsIn total, 225 patients met the diagnostic criteria for IC during the specified study period; of these, 204 patients (90.7%) and 21 patients (9.3%) were included in the nonrecurrent and recurrent IC groups, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed a significant association between IC recurrence and both cerebral infarction (P = 0.008, odds ratio [OR] = 6.3) and history of appendectomy (P = 0.0005, OR = 6.2). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time for all patients was 1556 (353-2768) days; this was much longer than the median (IQR) time to recurrence of 291 (64-907) days in the recurrent IC group. ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that prior cerebral infarction and appendicectomy may be risk factors for IC recurrence.

The synthesis of such particles is challenged using volatile and sensitive precursors utilizing shape capping agents. In this study, an easier two-step synthesis technique for the preparation of well-specified morphology TiO2 nanocrystals from TiO2 powder is demonstrated. The facet-dependent Fermi level and flat band potential of the prepared particles are calculated and their photoelectrochemical properties are investigated by Cu2+ and Pb2+ photo/electrodeposition. From Cu2+ electrodeposition, it is shown that the presence of {100} and {001} facets in cubic morphology facilitates the electrodeposition with progressive nucleation mechanisms, while the presence of {101} facet in octahedral geometry follows instantaneous nucleation mechanisms. The activity of electroreduction is also related to the flat-band potential which shows the highest activity in Pb2+ electrodeposition for octahedron nanostructure due to the alignment of the reduction potential to the edge of the flat band. Photodeposition of Cu2+ and Pb2+ ions shows identical trends to electrodeposition indicating the facets influence in ion adsorption and structure of the bandgap of morphological TiO2. The findings emphasize the importance of facet-dependent surface adsorption and bandgap structure designing faceted TiO2 nanoparticles for tailored applications.

These patients are often sub-optimally investigated and misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy or trigeminal neuralgia. This case series highlights the red flags in history and pitfalls that lead to delays to diagnosis and treatment.Methods: A retrospective case series of 19 consecutive patients with complete clinical histories with HNcSCC PNS without an obvious cutaneous primary lesion at time of presentation to a quaternary head and neck centre in Australia were identified and included for analysis.Results: Fifteen had CN VII PNS, 17 had CN V PNS, and 13 had both. The overall median symptom-to-diagnosis time was 12-months (IQR-15 months). Eight patients had CN VII PNS and described progressive segmental facial nerve palsy with a median symptom-to-diagnosis time of 9-months (IQR-11.75 months). Eleven patients had primary CN V PNS and described well localized parathesia, formication or neuralgia with a median symptom-to-diagnosis time of 19-months (IQR 27.5 months).Conclusion: PNS is often mistaken for benign cranial nerve dysfunction with delays in diagnosis worsening prognosis. Red flags such as progressive CN VII palsy or persistent CN V paraesthesia, numbness, formication or pain, particularly in the presence of immuno-compromise and/or a history of facial actinopathy should raise suspicion for PNS. Gadolinium-enhanced MR Neurography should be obtained expediently in patients with persistent/progressive CN V/CN VII palsies in patients with red flags, with low threshold for referral to a Head and Neck Surgeon.

Predictors of referral for long-term EEG monitoring for Medicare beneficiaries with drug-resistant epilepsy	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; neurologist referral; presurgical evaluation; video EEG	HEALTH-CARE ACCESS; UNITED-STATES; TEMPORAL-LOBE; SURGERY; OUTCOMES; ADULTS; ASSOCIATION; PREVALENCE; KNOWLEDGE	ObjectiveFor people with drug-resistant epilepsy, the use of epilepsy surgery is low despite favorable odds of seizure freedom. To better understand surgery utilization, we explored factors associated with inpatient long-term EEG monitoring (LTM), the first step of the presurgical pathway. MethodsUsing 2001-2018 Medicare files, we identified patients with incident drug-resistant epilepsy using validated criteria of & GE;2 distinct antiseizure medication (ASM) prescriptions and & GE;1 drug-resistant epilepsy encounter among patients with & GE;2 years pre- and & GE;1 year post-diagnosis Medicare enrollment. We used multilevel logistic regression to evaluate associations between LTM and patient, provider, and geographic factors. We then analyzed neurologist-diagnosed patients to further evaluate provider/environmental characteristics. ResultsOf 12 044 patients with incident drug-resistant epilepsy diagnosis identified, 2% underwent surgery. Most (68%) were diagnosed by a neurologist. In total, 19% underwent LTM near/after drug-resistant epilepsy diagnosis; another 4% only underwent LTM much prior to diagnosis. Patient factors most strongly predicting LTM were age <65 (adjusted odds ratio 1.5 [95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8]), focal epilepsy (1.6 [1.4-1.9]), psychogenic non-epileptic spells diagnosis (1.6 [1.1-2.5]) prior hospitalization (1.7, [1.5-2]), and epilepsy center proximity (1.6 [1.3-1.9]). Additional predictors included female gender, Medicare/Medicaid non-dual eligibility, certain comorbidities, physician specialties, regional neurologist density, and prior LTM. Among neurologist-diagnosed patients, neurologist <10 years from graduation, near an epilepsy center, or epilepsy-specialized increased LTM likelihood (1.5 [1.3-1.9], 2.1 [1.8-2.5], 2.6 [2.1-3.1], respectively). In this model, 37% of variation in LTM completion near/after diagnosis was explained by individual neurologist practice and/or environment rather than measurable patient factors (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.37). SignificanceA small proportion of Medicare beneficiaries with drug-resistant epilepsy completed LTM, a proxy for epilepsy surgery referral. While some patient factors and access measures predicted LTM, non-patient factors explained a sizable proportion of variance in LTM completion. To increase surgery utilization, these data suggest initiatives targeting better support of neurologist referral.

An NPC-type fault-tolerant MLI with symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage modes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUIT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						fault tolerance; multilevel inverters; neutral point clamped	5-LEVEL INVERTER TOPOLOGY; MULTILEVEL INVERTER; SINGLE; DESIGN; CAPABILITY; CONVERTER; POWER	Current studies have been challenging in reducing the number of devices and ensuring fault tolerance features of the multilevel inverters (MLIs). This article proposes a new fault-tolerant neutral point clamped (NPC)-type MLI using two three-level NPC legs, which can work in symmetric and asymmetric modes to generate nine and 17-level output voltage, respectively. The proposed converter has less device count and low total blocking voltage (TBV); further, the converter has different redundant switching states for tolerating different categories of faults. This article also implements a modified pulse width modulation (PWM) control strategy to ensure the zero-dc offset at the output when asymmetrical voltage levels appear with the occurrence of switch faults. A detailed operation of the proposed converter under symmetric and asymmetric modes is presented for healthy and different categories of faults. The converter's feasibility is verified by its current and voltage characteristics obtained from the MATLAB-SIMULINK software and the experimental prototype. Further, the efficiency of the converter is verified with the PLECS software. Finally, a comparison with recently proposed topologies is performed to emphasize converter performance.

J	Liranso, E; Yang, F				Liranso, Endrias; Yang, Fang			Mother's education and infant survival in Ethiopia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							MATERNAL EDUCATION; CHILD; HEALTH	ObjectiveFew studies in Ethiopia have explored the impact of the mothers' education on infant survival. Therefore, this study aimed to identify and analyze the proximate factors in the relationship between maternal education and infant survival in Ethiopia. MethodsThis study used the nationally representative 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey dataset. It analyzed a sample of 3831 newborn children using Cox regression models. ResultsThe findings revealed that infants born to educated mothers had lower odds of infant mortality than those born to mothers without formal education. Specifically, infants whose mothers had completed secondary school and had a better antenatal care attendance rate had 49.9% lower odds of infant mortality than those born to mothers with no formal education and a poor antenatal care attendance rate. Furthermore, infants whose mothers had at least some postsecondary education and who used delivery by health-care professionals, clean drinking water, and improved toilet facilities had 65.3%, 56.3%, and 68.6% lower odds of infant mortality, respectively, than those born to mothers with no formal education and who did not use those facilities. ConclusionsThis study concluded that the mothers' educational disparity is intimately tied to infant mortality, and that access to formal education, mainly for women, increases infant survival in Ethiopia. Future research should focus on mothers without formal education who do not have access to antenatal care visits for safe pregnancy, delivery by health-care professionals, clean drinking water, and improved toilet facilities in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.

BackgroundThis study evaluated the effects of probiotic therapy (PROB) in the prevention of local and systemic damage resulting from EP. MethodsForty-eight rats were allocated into four groups: C (control), PROB, EP, and EP-PROB. PROB (1 x 10(10) CFU/mL) administration lasted 8 weeks and PE was induced on the 7th week by placing ligature on the animals' lower first molars. All animals were euthanized in the 9th week of the experiment. Biomolecular analyses, RT-PCR, and histomorphometric analyses were performed. The data obtained were analyzed statistically (ANOVA, Tukey, p < .05). ResultsThe EP group had higher dyslipidemia when compared to the C group, as well as higher levels of insulin resistance, proteinuria levels, percentages of systolic blood pressure, percentage of fatty hepatocytes in the liver, and expression of adipokines was up-regulated (LEPR, NAMPT, and FABP4). All these parameters (except insulin resistance, systolic blood pressure, LEPR and FABP4 gene expression) were reduced in the EP-PROB group when compared to the EP group. The EP group had lower villus height and crypt depth, as well as a greater reduction in Bacteroidetes and a greater increase in Firmicutes when compared to the EP-PROB group. Greater alveolar bone loss was observed in the EP group when compared to the EP-PROB group. ConclusionBifidobacterium lactis HN019 can reduce the sequelae of EP in rats modulating intestinal parameters, attenuating expression of lipogenic genes and hepatic steatosis.	[Moreira, Andre L.

We investigate the employee-friendly (EF) corporate culture values that are strongly associated with firm value and operating performance using a unique social media dataset of approximately 250,000 crowdsourced employee reviews to evaluate 18 distinct characteristics of a firm's corporate culture. The explainable machine learning model is used to examine the nonlinear associations and relative importance of employee-friendly cultural values. We find that several employee-friendly corporate culture features are associated with firms' value (Tobin's Q) and operating performance (ROA). Our findings reveal two features whose association is clearly superior to other EF culture variables in our explainable machine learning model: pride in the company for Tobin's Q and job security for ROA. Based on the SHAP values, their effects are positive, significant, and relatively linear.

Industries have reported possible solid particle erosion-related failure in the OTSG boiler tubes because of the transport of precipitated dense inorganic particles. However, the presence of other damage mechanisms, e.g. corrosion, flow accelerated corrosion (FAC), often masks the evidence of erosive wear. Also, industries set an upper limit operating velocity for the OTSG using the API RP 14E guideline, which provides no quantitative erosion rates to determine an operating envelope. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of erosion damage in a SAGD OTSG boiler tube. The results revealed that API RP 14E may not be an effective decision-making tool for operating the OTSG system. For example, a 10% increase in velocity, even at conditions below the API RP 14E threshold, showed a decrease in the failure time of the boiler tubes by 40%-50%.

J	Allison, C; Thompson, K				Allison, Catherine; Thompson, Katie			Increasing capacity by moving away from one-to-one clinical supervision: using peer-assisted learning and a group model of student placements in community paediatric speech and language therapy to enable student-led service delivery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article; Early Access						capacity; community; group-based learning; placements; teaching		BackgroundHealth Education England (HEE) and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) have identified the need to increase placement capacity. Speech and language therapy is a shortage profession in the UK, so services need to consider innovative placement models to increase their placement offers without increasing the time burden on speech and language therapists (SLTs). AimsTo increase capacity for pre-registration practice-based learning by using peer-assisted learning (PAL) in a group model of student placement to enable student-led service delivery which provides high standards of clinical care and student experience and is an efficient use of SLT time. Methods & ProceduresA paediatric speech and language therapy service hosted eight student speech and language therapists (SSLTs) for their final pre-registration placement. SSLTs completed pre- and post-placement confidence ratings for a range of clinical skills; SSLTs and SLTs rated how useful different types of support were, and education settings provided feedback about working with the SSLTs. The number of clinical sessions completed by the SSLTs and the percentage of outcomes achieved for children with speech, language and communication needs were calculated. SLTs completed time-trackers for placement-related activities. Outcomes & ResultsThe impact of the placements was assessed using a tri-vector methodology consisting of: self-reporting by the student (using an evaluation form), feedback from the placement sites (schools) and analysis of targets set for individual children. SSLTs reported increased confidence in all clinical areas in their post-placement evaluation form. SLTs reported increased confidence in SSLTs working independently and an increase in the perceived benefit to the service for having SSLTs in comparison with the time invested in supporting SSLTs. SSLTs and SLTs found all types of support provided during the placement useful. Schools reported high levels of satisfaction for working with SSLTs. SSLTs completed more clinical sessions than an SLT would have been able to in the time SLTs invested in placement-related activities. Children achieved 60% of the targets set by SSLTs. Conclusions & ImplicationsThis placement model increased the capacity for SSLT placements by using PAL in a group model of student placement to enable student-led service delivery. The model provided high standards of clinical care and student experience and was an efficient use of SLT time. Wider use of this placement model would increase placement capacity and could also address vacancies in services. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSWhat is already known on the subjectSSLTs and SLTs are positive about the benefits of paired placements in comparison with individual placements. Other allied health professions have demonstrated that larger placements can be an effective way to support students and have used students to deliver student-led services. What this study adds to existing knowledgeThis paper is the first to look at whether PAL in a group model of student placements can be used in speech and language therapy to enable student-led service delivery which provides high standards of clinical care, maintains high standards of student experience and is an efficient use of SLT time. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?This paper demonstrates that PAL can be used effectively in a group model of student placements in a paediatric SLT service to increase student capacity and enable student-led service delivery. The proposed placement model provides a high-quality placement for SSLTs and the children they work with, and is also an efficient use of SLT time.

Utilising conservation of resources theory, we advance research on LMX and work engagement in two studies. Study 1 investigates the mediating role of a contextual resource (psychological safety) and an energy resource (job crafting) in a resource-rich context, and Study 2 investigates the moderating role of a personal resource (optimism) in a resource-poor context. Study 1 uses a three-wave research design with employees from the engineering and technical divisions of an Irish public utility operating in the energy market and found that both psychological safety and job crafting functioned as partial mediators. Study 2 uses a sample of teachers and tutors from three Irish local authority education and training organisations and found that subordinate optimism moderated the LMX work engagement relationship. Our study findings highlight that both psychological safety and job crafting operated as important linking mechanisms and shed light on how LMX is linked to work engagement in the case of public utility employees. We also found that employee optimism provided an explanation of when it will impact work engagement with employees working in an education context. We highlight theory and practice implications.

We examined the effect of vacation on employees' affective well-being (negative activation and vigor) concerning three different vacation effects (change in affective well-being over time): "vacation effect (during)" (before-during vacation), "vacation effect (after)" (before-after vacation), and "fade-out effect" (during-after vacation). A sample of 144 employees completed at least four out of five questionnaires: general (4 weeks before), pre-vacation (3 days before), on-vacation, Post-1 (first day after), and Post-2 (2 weeks after). Regarding vacation effects, affective well-being was higher during and after vacation than before. After work resumed, gains in affective well-being faded out (Exception: Negative activation did not differ from its level during vacation). Work engagement moderated vacation effects (during) and fade-out effects: Employees with lower levels of work engagement benefitted more while on vacation but experienced a greater fade-out. Lower levels of general well-being were related to increases in affective well-being during and after vacation. Well-being did not moderate fade-out effects. Our findings underscore the importance of work engagement and general well-being for vacation-related well-being gains and the importance of work engagement for the sustainability of vacation effects.

We explain how the discontinuities in the solutions arise and present a perturbing scheme, in combination with an adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method, to deal with this type of problems computationally. The pointwise and mean convergence of the continuous solution of the perturbed NDDE to the discontinuous solution of the original NDDE are proved. Our new method for discontinuous NDDEs and the rigorous theoretical analysis provided are particularly important since explicit NDDEs have received little attention in the literature. Numerical results are given to show that the proposed method can be implemented in an efficient and accurate manner.

In many clinical applications, it is desirable to identify and implement optimal time-invariant DSRs, where the parameters indexing the decision rules are shared across different decision points. We propose a new criterion for DSRs that accounts for benefit-cost tradeoff during the course of disease surveillance. We develop two methods to estimate the time-invariant DSRs optimizing the proposed criterion, and establish asymptotic properties for the estimated parameters of biomarkers indexing the DSRs. The first approach estimates the optimal decision rules for each individual at every stage via regression modeling, and then estimates the time-invariant DSRs via a classification procedure with the estimated time-varying decision rules as the response. The second approach proceeds by optimizing a relaxation of the empirical objective, where a surrogate function is utilized to facilitate computation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed methods. The methods are further applied to the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study (PASS).

Still, there is concern that it remains underutilized, and that seizure freedom rates have not improved over time. We investigated referral and surgical practices, patient characteristics, and postoperative outcomes over the past two decades.MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of children referred for epilepsy surgery at a tertiary center between 2000 and 2018. We extracted information from medical records and analyzed temporal trends using regression analyses.ResultsA total of 1443 children were evaluated for surgery. Of these, 859 (402 females) underwent surgical resection or disconnection at a median age of 8.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 4.6-13.4). Excluding palliative procedures, 67% of patients were seizure-free and 15% were on no antiseizure medication (ASM) at 1-year follow-up. There was an annual increase in the number of referrals (7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3-8.6; p < .001) and surgeries (4% [95% CI = 2.9-5.6], p < .001) over time. Duration of epilepsy and total number of different ASMs trialed from epilepsy onset to surgery were, however, unchanged, and continued to exceed guidelines. Seizure freedom rates were also unchanged overall but showed improvement (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; p = .027) after adjustment for an observed increase in complex cases. Children who underwent surgery more recently were more likely to be off ASMs postoperatively (OR 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.08; p = .013). There was a 17% annual increase (95% CI = 8.4-28.4, p < .001) in children identified to have a genetic cause of epilepsy, which was associated with poor outcome.SignificanceChildren with drug-resistant epilepsy continue to be put forward for surgery late, despite national and international guidelines urging prompt referral. Seizure freedom rates have improved over the past decades, but only after adjustment for a concurrent increase in complex cases. Finally, genetic testing in epilepsy surgery patients has expanded considerably over time and shows promise in identifying patients in whom surgery is less likely to be successful.

Pneumoconiosis incidence and prevalence among US Medicare beneficiaries, 1999-2019	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE			English	Article						asbestosis; coal workers' pneumoconiosis; medical claims; Medicare; pneumoconiosis	UNITED-STATES; SILICOSIS; WORKERS; MESOTHELIOMA; SURVEILLANCE; DEATHS	BackgroundPneumoconiosis is a group of occupational lung diseases caused by dust and fiber exposure. This study analyzes Medicare claims to estimate the burden of pneumoconiosis among fee-for-service (FFS; Medicare Parts A and B) Medicare beneficiaries during 1999-2019 in the United States. MethodsClaim and enrollment information from 81 million continuously enrolled FFS Medicare beneficiaries were analyzed. Beneficiaries with any pneumoconiosis and cause-specific pneumoconiosis (e.g., asbestosis, silicosis) were identified using three case definitions (broad, intermediate, and narrow) with varying diagnostic criteria based on claim International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-CM) diagnosis codes and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes. Results are presented as ranges of values for the three case definitions. ResultsThe 21-year prevalence range for any pneumoconiosis was 345,383-677,361 (412-833 per 100,000 beneficiaries) using the three case definitions. The highest prevalence was among those & GE;75 years of age, males, Whites, and North American Natives. Most claims (70.0%-72.5%) included an ICD-CM diagnosis code for asbestosis. The broad pneumoconiosis prevalence rate increased significantly (p < 0.001) during 2002-2009 by 3%-10% annually and declined significantly by 3%-5% annually starting in 2009. The average annual broad incidence rate declined significantly by 7% annually during 2009-2019. ConclusionsDespite the decline in rate for any pneumoconiosis among Medicare beneficiaries, which is primarily attributed to a decline in asbestosis, pneumoconiosis is prevalent among FFS Medicare beneficiaries.

Shifting to clean fuel has widely recognized benefits for women in saving time, improving health, and creating a better environment. Other benefits to women in the form of increasing empowerment are a relatively under-researched area. Using data from the nationally representative National Family Health Survey (2019-21) in India, this study uses endogenous treatment effect models to explore the causal effect of shifting to clean fuel on awareness, work, mobility, decision-making and financial autonomy. Analysis reveals significant gains in all dimensions, particularly in women's mobility and decision-making. The gains are relatively higher among less educated women, those from poor households, and those belonging to socially advantaged groups. Focusing on gains to empowerment will motivate women to adopt clean fuel and enable a holistic transformation of society through the simultaneous attainment of several Sustainable Development Goals.

Cubane and Cyclooctatetraene Pirfenidones - Synthesis and Biological evaluation	ASIAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access						Pirfenidone; bioisostere; biomotif; Cubane; Cyclooctatetraene	PULMONARY-FIBROSIS	Pirfenidone, an oral anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory medication used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), has been proposed to treat post-COVID pneumonia pulmonary fibrosis (PF). However, pirfenidone displays side effects which include hepatotoxicity and anorexia. Cubane and cyclooctatetraene (COT) derivatives of pirfenidone were prepared as bioisostere/biomotif replacements of the phenyl ring to explore potential changes in activity. The key intermediate, aminocubane, enabled the synthesis of both the cubane and cyclooctatetraene (COT) derived pirfenidone analogues in 6 steps. The COT derivative was observed to display similar activity and cytotoxicity with pirfenidone in an anti-virus and ACE2 inhibition assay, although limited effect was observed from pirfenidone and the analogues described herein.

Site Disorder as a Predictor for Compositionally Complex 5RE<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> Ceramic Phase Stability	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article						compositionally-complex ceramics; entropy stabilized; high-entropy-oxide; thermal barrier materials	LOW THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; RARE-EARTH-ZIRCONATE; HIGH-ENTROPY CERAMICS; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; IONIC-RADII; PYROCHLORES; OXIDES; GD; ER; HO	Phase formation and stability of five component compositionally complex rare earth zirconates (5RE(2)Zr(2)O(7)) were investigated by X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe analysis. Zirconates with different rare earth compositions (LaNdSmEuDy, LaNdSmEuYb, LaNdEuErYb, LaNdDyErYb, SmEuDyYHo, LaYHoErYb, and DyYHoErYb) were synthesized at 1700 & DEG;C and 2000 & DEG;C by the solid-state method to investigate the effect of A-site site disorder (& delta;(A)) on phase stability. Increased site disorder results from mixed cation occupancy with localized crystallographic strain and bond disorder. Compositions LaNdSmEuDy (& delta;(A) = 4.6) and LaNdSmEuYb (& delta;(A) = 6.0) produced a single pyrochlore phase and compositions SmDyYHoErYb (& delta;(A) = 2.8), LaYHoErYb (& delta;(A) = 6.2), and DyYHoErYb (& delta;(A) = 1.7) produced a single fluorite phase. High & delta;(A) compositions LaNdEuErYb (& delta;(A) = 6.9) and LaNdDyErYb (& delta;(A) = 7.2) produced a pyrochlore and fluorite phase mixture at 1700 & DEG;C. Single phase was obtained for the latter composition at 2000 & DEG;C. Of the single phase compositions calcined at 1700 & DEG;C, LaNdSmEuYb and LaYHoErYb (both with largest & delta;(A)) showed decomposition to mixed fluorite and pyrochlore phases during lower temperature anneals, indicating entropic stabilization. Comparison with prior work shows a temperature dependence of the critical & delta;(A) for phase stability, and compositions near it are expected to be entropy stabilized.	[Lowry, Daniel R.

We aimed to compare distress levels of survivors from ethnic minorities to that of the majority population, determine whether the association between having cancer (yes vs. no) and distress differs among ethnic groups and investigate sociocultural correlates of distress. MethodsCross-sectional data were derived from HELIUS, a multi-ethnic cohort study conducted in the Netherlands. Of 19,147 participants, 351 were diagnosed with cancer (n = 130 Dutch, n = 75 African Surinamese, n = 53 South-Asian Surinamese, n = 43 Moroccan, n = 28 Turkish, n = 22 Ghanaian). Distress (PHQ-9, MCS-12) and correlates were assessed by self-report. Cancer-related variables were derived from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. ResultsSurvivors were on average 7 years post-diagnosis. Survivors from South-Asian Surinamese, Moroccan, Turkish and Ghanaian origin reported more distress than survivors from Dutch origin (effect size(range): 0.44-1.17; adjusted models). The association between having cancer or not with distress differed in direction between Dutch and the non-Dutch ethnic groups: Non-Dutch cancer patients tended to have more distress than their cancer-free peers, whereas Dutch cancer patients tended to have less distress than their cancer-free peers. For Moroccan and Turkish patients, the acculturation style of separation/marginalization, compared to integration/assimilation, was associated with higher depressive symptoms. In analyses pooling data from all ethnic minorities, lower health literacy, lower emotional support satisfaction and younger age at the time of migration were associated with higher depressive symptoms. Lower health literacy, fewer emotional support transactions, and more frequent attendance at religious services were associated with worse mental health. ConclusionCancer survivors from ethnic minorities experience more distress than those from the majority population. Culturally sensitive supportive care should be considered.

DesignScoping review. The results were summarised using a narrative synthesis technique. Data SourcesA review of the literature published between 2001 and 2021 was conducted between October and November 2021 using PubMed, CINAHL and SciELO. Review MethodsThe research team agreed on a search strategy based on clinical practice guidelines for assessing kidney transplantation candidates. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese were included. ResultsA total of 377 studies were identified, and 49 articles were included after the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The narrative synthesis was structured into four themes: Physical needs; Psychological and quality of life needs; Education and adherence needs; and Nurses' role. ConclusionNursing assessment of kidney transplantation candidates should encompass physical, psychosocial and adherence aspects. A variety of methodologies and resources are available for this assessment. Nurses contribute to coordinating access to kidney transplantation, aiming to improve adherence to an appropriate lifestyle to prevent patients from being excluded from kidney transplantation or suffering from kidney transplantation-related complications. ImpactBased on our findings, we managed to design a nursing care map for kidney transplantation candidates combining the main elements of nursing care that should be incorporated into this process. Advanced practice nursing professionals play a crucial role in accessing renal transplant care.

Processing black rice grains to obtain flour: Influence of pretreatments on mass transfer, in vitro digestibility, and technological properties	CEREAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						& alpha;-amylase; ethanol; glycemic index; heat moisture; high hydrostatic pressure	MOISTURE TREATMENT; HEAT	Background and Objectives: The objective of this work was to evaluate the processing of black rice grains to obtain flour and to verify the influence of pretreatments on mass transfer, in vitro digestibility, and technological properties. The grains were submitted to heat moisture treatment (HMT) with a final humidity of 30% at 110 degrees C for 2 h, black rice pretreatment with ethanol (BRE) in the proportion 1:1 (wt/wt) for 5 min/25 degrees C, and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) under conditions of 200 MPa for 10 min/25 degrees C. Then, the grains were dried at 60 degrees C at an air velocity of 1.5 m/s and ground in an electric multigrain grinder. Was analyzed the mass transfer, in vitro digestion, water, oil, and milk retention capacity, total phenolic compounds (TPC), total anthocyanins (TA), antioxidant activities by (2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic) acid, 2,2-diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl, ferric-reducing antioxidant power, and oxygen radical absorb-ance capacity Surface appearance by scanning electron microscopy, and thermal analysis by differential scanning calorimetry was carried out.Findings: The grains when submitted to the HHP obtained a reduction of 58.82% in the drying time, while the HMT promoted an increase of 23.5% when compared to the control. The pretreatments influenced the in vitro digestibility, where the HHP had the highest value (86.33), as well as the highest water, oil, and milk retention capacities. BRE positively impacted TPC, TA, and antioxidant activities regardless of the methods used. HMT promoted the formation of cavities, fissures, and holes on the surface, resulting in a rough appearance and presenting greater thermal resistance with an enthalpy of 12.35 J/g. Conclusions: This research paved the way for potential commercial applications of black rice flour as an ingredient in functional foods.	[Santos, Newton C.

However, data describing CF clinician perceptions regarding telehealth are scarce. We aimed to describe clinician experiences and attitudes towards telehealth in CF care among health professionals across Australia. MethodsCF multidisciplinary health professionals from all CF clinics in Australia were sent an anonymous electronic survey. ResultsEighty-five responses were received representing 15 of 23 (65%) centers. Most clinicians reported using telehealth for routine clinic visits, and a range of other clinical encounters (69.9%). Telehealth was widely perceived as acceptable (91.8%), and clinicians were comfortable/very comfortable (81.2%) integrating telehealth into future CF care. Despite this, 64.1% of respondents considered telehealth clinics to be much worse than face-to-face clinics and 57.5% reported quality of care was somewhat/much worse using telehealth. Home spirometry was available in 73.7% of centers, however, only 26.7% of clinics could provide spirometers for >75% eligible patients. Growth and microbiology assessments were often missed in telehealth clinics and 75.7% reported a technical issue had prevented a telehealth consultation from occurring. ConclusionsTelehealth for CF in Australia is considered feasible and acceptable by CF clinicians, although use of telehealth varies widely between centers. Concerns exist around the impact of telehealth on health outcomes, especially given core assessments are frequently omitted. Guidelines may help ensure the benefits of telehealth are realized for people with CF without compromising the standard of care.

The main purpose of this study was to demonstrate the challenges when comparing samples subject to different preanalytical conditions. We performed a global (commonly referred to as "untargeted") liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis of blood samples from cases of sudden infant death syndrome and controls stored as dried blood spots on a chemical-free filter card for 15 years at room temperature compared with the same blood samples stored as whole blood at -80 & DEG;C before preparing new dried blood spots using a chemically treated filter card. Principal component analysis plots distinctly separated the samples based on the type of filter card and storage, but not sudden infant death syndrome versus controls. Note that, 1263 out of 5161 and 642 out of 1587 metabolite features detected in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively, were found to have significant 2-fold changes in amounts corresponding to different preanalytical conditions. The study demonstrates that the dried blood spot metabolome is largely affected by preanalytical factors. This emphasizes the importance of thoroughly addressing preanalytical factors during study design and interpretation, enabling identification of real, biological differences between sample groups whilst preventing other factors or random variation to be falsely interpreted as positive results.

Materials and Methods: Forty patients with keratinized gingiva insufficiency and Cairo's RT 2 gingival recession (formerly classified as Miller class III) in their mandibular central incisors were randomly divided into two groups: FGG and FGG + BTX. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), keratinized gingiva width (KGW), attached gingiva width (AGW), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival thickness (GT), gingival recession amount (GRA), gingival recession width (GRW), and root closure percentage (RCP%) parameters were measured at baseline and at first, third, and sixth months after the operation. Results: There was no difference in PI, GI, and PPD levels in both groups (p > 0.05). While the change in GT and RCP% levels were found to be statistically significantly higher at FGG + BTX group than FGG group, the change in GRW and CAL levels were statistically significantly lower (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that BTX-A injection applied to the mentalis muscle after FGG operation may have positive effects in terms of KGW, AGW, GT, RCP%, GRW, and CAL parameters. Clinical Significance: As a result of the fact that BTX-A injection into the mentalis muscle contributed to the nutrition and immobility of FGG, positive developments were obtained in terms of clinical periodontal parameters. BTX-A injection into the mentalis muscle may be an alternative method that increases the success rate of Cairo's RT 2 gingival recession.

This study investigated the positive effects and the underlying mechanism of Arg treatment on the quality of postharvest blueberries. Arg effectively mitigated fruit decay and improved the quality of blueberries, including weight loss, firmness, and soluble solid content. Mechanistically, Arg-mediated activation of the anti-oxidative defense system reduced reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative damage. Moreover, Arg treatment decreased the activities and gene expression of phospholipase D, lipoxygenase, and lipase-inhibiting membrane lipid peroxidation during the prolonged storage of blueberries. Meanwhile, Arg treatment increased nitric oxide (NO) content and NO synthase activity. Furthermore, correlation and principal component analyses revealed the enhancement of Arg treatment on antioxidant capacity. This study suggests that Arg treatment can maintain the postharvest quality of blueberries by improving antioxidant capacity.

Firstly, a one-grid penalty FEM is proposed and analyzed. Since this method is nonlinear, a novel linearized iteration scheme is derived for solving it. We also derived the stability and convergence of numerical solutions for this iteration scheme. Furthermore, a two-grid penalty FEM is developed for Smagorinsky model. Under & epsilon;<<h$$ \varepsilon <<h $$, this method consist of solving a nonlinear Smagorinsky model by the one-grid penalty FEM with the proposed linearized iteration scheme on a coarse mesh with mesh width H$$ H $$ and then solving a linearized Smagorinsky model based on the Newton iteration on a fine mesh with mesh width h=O(H2)$$ h equal to \mathcal{O}\left({H} circumflex 2\right) $$, respectively. Stability and error estimates of numerical solutions for two-grid penalty FEM are presented. Finally, some numerical tests are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the developed methods.

Here resonance energy transfer (RET) from a red-emitting WS2 monolayer (1L-WS2) to a layer of near-infrared (NIR) emitting organic dye molecules is demonstrated. It is found that the total photoluminescence (PL) yield of the heterostructures is up to a factor of eight higher as compared to the PL yield of pristine 1L-WS2. This is attributed to the efficient conversion of the mostly non-radiative excitons in 1L-WS2 into radiative excitons in the dye layer. A type-I energy level alignment of the 1L-WS2/dye interface assures the emission of bright PL. From excitation density-dependent PL experiments, it is concluded that RET prevails against defect-assisted non-radiative recombination as well as Auger-type exciton-exciton annihilation in 1L-WS2. The work paves the way for employing organic dye molecules in heterostructures with TMDCs in nanoscale light-emitting devices with improved efficiency and tunable color.

It is therefore time to reflect upon the interplay of experiments and simulations and the upcoming dilemma of drawing general conclusions from increasingly complex model approaches that naturally go along with advancements and insights in the research field. Albeit this perspective focuses on (microstructure) models for composite cathodes, it is also an invitation to contemplate the epistemological considerations and the proposed tentative agenda on how to build useful models for other sub-fields of the solid-state research community.

For UF/DF membranes composed of regenerated cellulose (RC), sanitization with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide is generally recommended by the supplier, but it may not be sufficient for reducing bioburden during large scale manufacturing. Therefore, more stringent sanitization methods for RC membranes are required. However, chemicals used in such sanitization step may disrupt membrane integrity, while the corresponding residuals may reduce product quality. Previous work has shown that high concentration of sodium hydroxide or addition of peracetic acid (PAA) can effectively reduce bioburden, but their effects on the RC membranes remain unknown. In this work, we assessed the impact of two sanitization methods, 0.5 M sodium hydroxide and 30 mM PAA in combination with 0.5 M sodium hydroxide, on membrane integrity and protein quality of Millipore and pall corporation (PALL) membranes. Both methods showed a similar impact as the control after performing 15 cycles. However, the addition of PAA may cause residual chemical concerns, therefore, 0.5 M sodium hydroxide was recommended as an effective and safe sanitization method for RC UF/DF membranes.

Recently, the development of competitive electricity markets and responsive loads participation in such markets together with the integration of regional energy networks (RENs) have resulted in creating some challenges for RENs' owners to increase operating efficiency, and reduce investment costs. In this paper, to overcome these problems, a new modeling for coordinated planning of distribution networks and RENs in the presence of responsive loads is proposed and to achieve the optimal solution of the problem, the genetic algorithm is used. Operation uncertainties due to the installation of wind turbines and photovoltaic resources in RENs are considered. The probability-tree method is used to generate and model operation scenarios and their variable production, respectively. To validate and confirm the efficiency of the proposed model, numerical studies were applied on a 25-bus Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard distribution network, including two RENs equipped with responsive loads. The results show the fact that the flexibility of the demand side in the electrical sector due to the activity of responsive loads causes to increase in the installation capacity of energy resources and storages.

Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and breathlessness, alongside airway narrowing, hyperresponsiveness, and inflammation. Early diagnosis and management are essential. Not only because untreated or poorly managed asthma and EIB potentially affects competition performance and training, but also because untreated airway inflammation can result in airway epithelial damage, remodeling, and fibrosis. Asthma and EIB do not hinder performance, as advancements in treatment strategies have made it possible for affected athletes to compete at the highest level. However, practitioners and athletes must ensure that the treatment complies with general guidelines and anti-doping regulations to prevent the risk of a doping sanction because of inadvertently exceeding specified dosing limits. In this review, we describe considerations and challenges in diagnosing and managing athletes with asthma and EIB. We also discuss challenges facing athletes with asthma and EIB, while also being subject to anti-doping regulations.

Using the thermodynamically more favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has attracted ever-growing attention. Herein, we report a twisted NiCoP nanowire array immobilized with Ru single atoms (Ru-1-NiCoP) as superior bifunctional electrocatalyst toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), realizing an ultralow working potential of -60 mV and overpotential of 32 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Inspiringly, two-electrode electrolyzer based on overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) demonstrates outstanding activity with a record-high current density of 522 mA cm(-2) at cell voltage of 0.3 V. DFT calculations elucidate the cooperative Ni(Co)-Ru-P sites in Ru-1-NiCoP optimize H* adsorption, and enhance adsorption of *N2H2 to significantly lower the energy barrier for hydrazine dehydrogenation. Moreover, a self-powered H-2 production system utilizing OHzS device driven by direct hydrazine fuel cell (DHzFC) achieve a satisfactory rate of 24.0 mol h(-1) m(-2).

J	Jia, YJ; Wang, TF; Schweizer, K; Ren, XZ				Jia, Yujie; Wang, Tengfei; Schweizer, Karl; Ren, Xuezhu			Neural correlates of intelligence: ERP Components of temporary storage predict fluid intelligence over and above those of executive functions	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						ERP; individual differences; inhibition; updating; working memory	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; FRONTAL-LOBE; SHORT-TERM; POTENTIAL ERP; ATTENTION; TASK; ORGANIZATION; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION	Previous research has revealed that individuals with different levels of intelligence exhibit distinct patterns of event-related potentials (ERPs) related to executive functions and temporary storage. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the relative contributions of these ERPs in predicting individual differences in fluid intelligence. This study aims to examine the extent to which ERPs associated with executive functions and temporary storage can predict individual differences in fluid intelligence. Special attention is given to determining whether electrophysiological activities of temporary storage can predict fluid intelligence after accounting for executive functions, and vice versa. Both executive attention and temporary storage were measured by two experimental tasks, while electroencephalographic data were collected simultaneously. Fluid intelligence was assessed by two established tests. To address previous inconsistencies due to small sample sizes, a relatively large sample of young adults (N = 136) was recruited. The results revealed that participants with lower fluid intelligence displayed larger P3 amplitudes in the executive functions and temporary storage tasks compared to those with higher fluid intelligence. Additionally, the amplitudes of frontal and parietal P3s elicited by both executive functions and temporary storage significantly predicted fluid intelligence. Interestingly, the frontal and parietal P3s associated with temporary storage predicted fluid intelligence beyond the contributions of executive functions, supporting the storage account of individual differences in fluid intelligence. This study provides an original and fresh understanding of how executive functions and temporary storage contribute to fluid intelligence, offering new insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying intelligence.

Ultrasonographic measurements (supraspinatus tendon thickness, humeral head cartilage thickness, deltoid muscle thickness, and acromiohumeral distance) were performed using a portable device and a linear probe. Shoulder (flexion, extension, abduction, internal and external rotation) and back (serratus anterior, lower, and middle trapezius) isometric muscle strength were measured with a handheld dynamometer.Results Supraspinatus tendon thickness and acromiohumeral distance were similar in all periods (all p > .05); however, deltoid muscle and humeral head cartilage thicknesses increased throughout the season (p = .002, p = .008, respectively). Likewise, whereas shoulder muscle strength increased (all p < .05), back muscle strength was similar in all periods (all p > .05).Conclusions In preadolescent swimmers, acromiohumeral distance and supraspinatus tendon thickness seem to not change; but humeral head cartilage and deltoid muscle thicknesses as well as shoulder muscle strength increase throughout the season.

Plasma-based dry processing is an established methodology for the modification of materials surfaces as it does not present the disadvantages often associated with wet treatments. This is becoming a fine tool to reach precise atomic-scale engineering of the MHP surfaces. Herein is reported a comprehensive picture of the interaction between different plasma chemistries and MHP thin films. The impact of Ar, H-2, N-2, and O-2 low-pressure plasmas on MHP optochemical properties and morphology is correlated with the performance of photovoltaic devices and rationalized by density functional theory calculations. Strong morphological modifications and selective removal of the uppermost methylammonium moieties are deemed responsible for nonradiative surface defects suppression and higher solar cell performances. Ellipsometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies shine light on the subtle modifications induced by the different plasma environments, paving the way for the more effective engineering of plasma-based (deposition) processing. Notably, for O-2 plasma treatment, deep-state traps induced by the formation of IO4- species are demonstrated and rationalized, highlighting the challenges in optimizing O-2 plasma-based solutions for MHP-based devices.

The mean newborn length of stay in Pakistan was 2 days compared with 10 days for India. Fewer diagnostics and other investigations were used to determine neonatal condition or guide treatment in the Pakistani NICU. Because of limited information from testing in Pakistan concerning clinical respiratory distress, respiratory distress syndrome appeared to be over-diagnosed, whereas other conditions including pneumonia, sepsis, necrotising entercolitis and intraventricular haemorrhage were rarely diagnosed.Conclusion: In the Pakistani site, the limited resources available to the NICU appeared related to a shorter length of stay and decreased diagnostic testing, likely ex-plaining the higher mortality. With improved care, reduction in mortality among preterm neonates should be achievable.

Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate-targeting agents.Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase-separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self-condensates of tau, two-component tau/polyanion and three-component tau/RNA/alpha-synuclein coacervates. The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) - scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.

In this paper, based on the numerical eigensolution of the singular displacement and stress field together with the Hellinger-Reissner (H-R) variational principle, a novel crack-tip singular element is established to replace the enriched element in the crack-tip region in the traditional XFEM. The stress field inside the element adopts a series expression instead of only including the leading-order terms. The element only requires Gaussian integration at the element boundary and avoids mesh refinement in the crack-tip region. The element can be used to analyze cracks in anisotropic materials, interface cracks, and cracks terminating at the bimaterial interface. The numerical solutions of the singular stress field in various crack forms are presented through numerical examples, which proves the effectiveness and versatility of the novel crack-tip singular element.

J	Yrigoy, I				Yrigoy, Ismael			UNPACKING CAPITAL SWITCHING: Value, Rentierism and Displacement in Absolute and Relative Forms of Switching	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						capital switching; rentierism; displacement; value; Spanish real estate; housing	GROUND RENT; LAND RENT; MARKET; GEOGRAPHIES	Harvey's (1978) switching theory has been widely used to theorize investments in the built environment. Crucially, in switching theory no distinction has been made between investments in the construction of the newly built environment and investments into the existing built environment. The distinction between these two types of switching is key to unveiling the relations between how value is produced, rents are extracted and interest payments are made as investments flow with the real estate sector, and the implications that such switching has for displacement. I discuss the distinction between different types of switching and the implications thereof by analysing the ebb and flow of investments in Spanish real estate from 2000 to 2007 and from 2014 to 2018. On the one hand, I claim that the two switching waves were qualitatively different in so far as capital was fixed in the built environment through the construction of new buildings between 2000 and 2007, whereas from 2014 to 2018 capital was fixed in existing buildings. In the first switching phase, value was produced and land rents were extracted, whereas the second switching phase was characterized mainly by rent extraction. On the other hand, the first switching moment entailed an increase in housing provision, whereas the second switching moment led to widespread displacement of the population.

In this study, another factor that affects the photodimerization reactivity of chalcone analogues was found. The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)-2(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (BIO), (E)-2-(naphthalen-2-ylmethylene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one (NIO), (Z)-2-(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran-3(2H)-one (BFO), and (Z)-2-(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen3(2H)-one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+ 2] cycloaddition did not occur in the crystals of BIO and BTO. The single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface analyses revealed that interactions of C=O center dot center dot center dot H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in the crystal of BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon-carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2 + 2] cycloaddition. In the crystal of BTO, similar interactions of Cl center dot center dot center dot S and C=O center dot center dot center dot H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O center dot center dot center dot H only exists around the carbonyl group in the crystals of BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2 + 2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle-like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo-induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon-carbon double bond affect the [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt's criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.

The obtained Gen-MMIPs were characterized by TEM, VSM, FT-IR, and XRD. The adsorption capacity of Gen-MMIPs for Gen is 33.23 mg/g, with the kinetic adsorption of Gen-MMIPs reaching equilibrium in 30 min. The imprinting factor (& alpha;) is 2.15, which indicated that the Gen-MMIPs had good selectivity, high binding capacity. The Gen-MMIPs were evaluated to separate genistein from the crude sample of Flemingia philippinensis Merr. et Rolfe, which showed that the Gen-MMIPs can be applied to separate genistein from complicated samples of natural products. These results indicated that the Gen-MMIPs have great potential for efficient separation and enrichment of genistein in complicated samples.

Additionally, it offers a novel avenue for the design of fiber oscillators capable of operating at high power levels. At present, the focus of STML laser research primarily revolves around this aspect. However, considering practical applications, there is a strong desire to conceive a simple all-fiber STML oscillator with both high beam quality and high power. In this study, an all-fiber, high-power STML oscillator based on multimode fibers is constructed and investigated. By manipulating the pump power and the polarization state, the laser could operate in a dissipative soliton or noise-like pulse regime, both with average output powers of two operation states reaching the Watt level. Simultaneously, high-quality output beam profiles are observed in both operation states. To the best of knowledge, this is the first demonstration of high-power spatiotemporal mode-locking with high beam quality. The study holds great benefits for advancing the investigations of compact all-fiber STML lasers which deliver high-power outputs with superior beam quality and ultimately propels the application of STML lasers. Furthermore, this study contributes to the understanding of the behavior of STML lasers with high power.

These multifunctional materials endow broadband solar absorptions, chemical/physical stability, porous, and active sites for in-situ photodegradation with exceptional solar-to-vapor conversion efficiencies. The structural configuration of evaporation structures is significantly improved by effective thermal management and salt-resistant water channels with balanced relation between evaporation flux and water intake. These attributes lead this technology to higher evaporation rates and complimentary applications such as waste heat recovery to thermoelectricity, salt collection from seawater, and micro-organism disinfection from wastewater. This review comprehensively reports the recent advances in state-of-the-art multifunctional materials, novel evaporation designs with significant structural optimization, and their small-scale prototypes. The current challenges, origins, and possible solutions are provided. This systematic review inspires the nanoresearch community to push forward solar-driven evaporation technology with superb complimentary energy conversion applications.

Skin conditions not only impose a significantly impaired quality of life on individuals with diabetes but also predispose patients to further complications. Knowledge of cutaneous biology and the wound healing process under diabetic conditions is largely limited to animal models, and studies focusing on biology of the human condition of DFUs remain limited. In this review, we discuss the critical molecular, cellular, and structural changes to the skin in the hyperglycaemic and insulin-resistant environment of diabetes with a focus specifically on human-derived data. Elucidating the breadth of the cutaneous manifestations coupled with effective diabetes management is important for improving patient quality of life and averting future complications including wound healing disorders.

Whereas behavioral adjustments can buffer direct physiological and fitness costs of exposure to excessive temperature in wild animals, these may prove more difficult during specific life stages when vagility is reduced (e.g., early developmental stages). By means of a nest cooling experiment, we tested the effects of extreme temperatures on different stages of reproduction in a cavity-nesting Mediterranean bird of prey, the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), facing a recent increase in the frequency of heatwaves during its breeding season. Nest temperature in a group of nest boxes placed on roof terraces was reduced by shading them from direct sunlight in 2 consecutive years (2021 and 2022). We then compared hatching failure, mortality, and nestling morphology between shaded and non-shaded (control) nest boxes. Nest temperature in control nest boxes was on average 3.9 degrees C higher than in shaded ones during heatwaves, that is, spells of extreme air temperature (>37 degrees C for =2 consecutive days) which hit the study area during the nestling-rearing phase in both years. Hatching failure markedly increased with increasing nest temperature, rising above 50% when maximum nest temperatures exceeded 44 degrees C. Nestlings from control nest boxes showed higher mortality during heatwaves (55% vs. 10% in shaded nest boxes) and those that survived further showed impaired morphological growth (body mass and skeletal size). Hence, heatwaves occurring during the breeding period can have both strong lethal and sublethal impacts on different components of avian reproduction, from egg hatching to nestling growth. More broadly, these findings suggest that the projected future increases of summer temperatures and heatwave frequency in the Mediterranean basin and elsewhere in temperate areas may threaten the local persistence of even relatively warm-adapted species.

Investigation on the properties of chemically treated flexible parts fabricated through material extrusion based additive manufacturing technology	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article						additive manufacturing; chemical treatment; fused filament fabrication; post processing; thermoplastic polyurethane	DEPOSITION; FDM; STRENGTH; PARAMETERS; DESIGN	The poor strength and surface texture of the additively manufactured components has restricted its usage as a functional part. The post processing methods can overcome this limitation and open new opportunities in different application areas. In the present study, chemical finishing process has been employed for the flexible components build through material extrusion based additive manufacturing technology. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) has been chosen as the material for printing flexible parts. Taguchi orthogonal array-based design of experiments has been employed. Three process parameters that is, solvent type, infill density and immersion time have been selected for the study. The percentage improvement in the surface roughness as physical property and compressive strength as mechanical property has been chosen as the response parameters. The dimensional deviation was investigated by measuring the change in the dimensions of the manufactured components. It has been observed from ANOVA analysis that the improvement in surface roughness and compressive strength depends significantly on the immersion time. The Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent and immersion time of 125 s has been found significant for different properties of the chemically treated TPU parts.

However, few reports have been found on the related factors of at-risk IA among regular workers by a nationwide survey. The study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of at-risk IA and identify related factors among senior high school teachers in Japan.MethodsThis survey was a cross-sectional survey of high schools across Japan in 2017. There were 3189 teachers (2088 males and 1098 female) who participated in this survey. The questionnaire asked about their devices, both the time and the activities of using their internet, and sociodemographic factors. IA was measured by the internet addiction test (IAT) by which 40-79 points were classified as at-risk IA, and more as IA. We compared the related factors of at-risk IA and non-IA using descriptive analysis and multivariable regression analysis.ResultsThe rates of IA and at-risk IA were 0.09% (n = 3) and 6.91% (n = 220), respectively. At-risk IA was positively associated with activities on the internet for gaming, entertainment, net-surfing, and younger ages. In addition, the at-risk IA group had a longer time spent on the internet than the non-IA group.ConclusionsAround 7% of high school teachers are at-risk IA in this survey, though they have regular work. Our results suggest that at-risk IA may be reinforced not only by the active internet use such as gaming, but also by purposeless behaviors, such as net-surfing. Managing time on the internet may support preventing at-risk IA among senior high school teachers.

Very recently, oligomerized fused-ring electron acceptors (OFREAs) have emerged as a promising alternative to small-molecular/polymeric acceptor-based OSCs due to their unique advantages such as well-defined structures, batch reproducibility, good film formation, low diffusion coefficient, and excellent stability. So far, rapid advances have been made in the development of OFREAs consisting of directly/rigidly/flexibly linked oligomers and fused ones. In this Minireview, we systematically summarized the recent research progress of OFREAs, including structural diversity, synthesis approach, molecular conformation and packing, and long-term stability. Finally, we conclude with future perspectives on the challenges to be addressed and potential research directions. We believe that this Minireview will encourage the development of novel OFREAs for OSC applications.

J	Halvorsen, TG; Reubsaet, L				Halvorsen, Trine Gronhaug; Reubsaet, Leon			Is this the end of dried blood spots as we know it?	ANALYTICAL SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PAPER; CELLULOSE; QUANTIFICATION; DIGESTION; MICROEXTRACTION; IMMUNOCAPTURE; PROTEOLYSIS; PROTEINS; CAPTURE	In 2017 integrated sampling and sample preparation for simplified liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of proteins from dried blood spots were introduced. The concept, called smart samplers or smart sampling, enables proteolysis or affinity clean-up, two common sample preparation steps in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric bioanalysis of proteins, to start at the moment of sampling. The idea is to utilize the time for sampling and drying to perform these time-consuming and labour-intensive steps. Hence, only a simplified sample preparation is necessary after the arrival of the sample in the lab. In this perspective, we present an overview of the smart sampling approach where the conventional protein analysis workflow is reshuffled to start already prior to arrival in the lab. In addition, we present a thorough discussion of integrating sample preparation steps such as proteolysis or affinity capture in the sampling. Finally, in the end, we try to answer the question if conventional dried blood spots will become obsolete in the future.

In the present study, the changes of PM emission concentration induced by the leakage of the bag filter materials was studied. The results showed that the concentration of particles in the size range of 20-1000 nm significantly increased when the bag filter sample had three holes with a diameter of similar to 500 mu m. In order to prevent the loss induced by the leakage of bag filter, a resistance sensing method was developed to detect the early leakage of single bag filter. The effectiveness of proposed sensing method was verified by detecting the leakage of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bag filter. A sensing grid made of PMMA conductive threads was embedded in the PMMA bag filter, and the resistance change (Delta R) induced by the broken of sensing grid was used as sensing signal. The Delta R of sensing grid was 3.24, 3.31, and 3.05 Omega, respectively, when the bag filter failed due to the mechanical stress, chemical corrosion, and thermal erosion. Moreover, a model was proposed to predict the numbers of broken conductive PMMA threads that could indicate the damage area of the failed bag filter.

However, low resolution and large wire-wire contact resistance still impede the stability and sensitivity of AgNW-based flexible strain sensors. Herein, self-reduced soldered AgNW pattern is fabricated by combining the high-resolution electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing and joining of AgNWs. The resolution achieved by EHD printing is up to & AP;20 & mu;m. The contact resistance between AgNWs is greatly reduced by depositing Ag atoms at the AgNW junctions while EHD printing Ag ion ink on as-prepared AgNW pattern. After self-reduced soldering process, the sheet resistance decreases from 14.8 to 2.13 & omega; sq(-1). This process can be conducted under room temperature and ambient conditions and requires no external assistance from heat, light, or mechanical pressing. Furthermore, the deposited Ag atoms at the junctions remarkably improve the sensitivity (gauge factor 14.5-37.9) and stability (over 5000 stretching cycles with 25% strain). This superior sensitivity and stability occur because nano-junctions induced by the self-reduced soldering process significantly reduce the initial resistance and enable a robust network structure. This EHD-based technique for nanojoining of AgNWs demonstrates its potential for flexible and wearable electronics.

The cells may be filled with a fluid or just with air, have different size, shape, and wall thickness. Less is known about how the mechanical and morphological parameters of the cellular materials influence their biologically relevant functions. A simple descriptive 2D numerical model of a cellular material based on Voronoi diagrams is presented here which aims prompt investigation how structural parameters influence its physical properties. The preliminary numerical simulations demonstrate that with an increasing wall thickness the energy dissipation increases and with an increasing cell density also an average stress increases. Other interesting results are that an increased dissipation constant of cellular material reduces the stress, and that in hierarchical foams the dissipation takes place mostly in the thick walls. The presented approach allows screening the influence of further material features and structural parameters, such as for example, different kinds of gradients or different properties of biological or biologically inspired cellular materials at different loading conditions. Direct comparison of different real biological structures could be also performed, especially when real experimental measurements are impossible.

A novel approach to quantifying surgical workflow in robotic-assisted lobectomy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER ASSISTED SURGERY			English	Article; Early Access						robotic-assisted lobectomy; surgical education; surgical efficiency measures; surgical workflow	GLOBAL EVALUATIVE ASSESSMENT; VALIDATION; SKILLS	IntroductionUnderstanding surgical workflow is critical for optimizing efficiencies and outcomes; however, most research evaluating workflow is impacted by observer subjectivity, limiting its reproducibility, scalability, and actionability. To address this, we developed a novel approach to quantitatively describe workflow within robotic-assisted lobectomy (RL). We demonstrate the utility of this approach by analysing features of surgical workflow that correlate with procedure duration. MethodsRL was deconstructed into 12 tasks by expert thoracic surgeons. Task start and stop times were annotated across videos of 10 upper RLs (5 right and 5 left). Markov Networks were used to estimate both the likelihood of transitioning from one task to another and each task-transition entropy (i.e. complexity). Associations between the frequency with which each task was revisited intraoperatively and procedure duration were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. ResultsEntropy calculations identified fissure dissection and hilar node dissection as tasks with especially complex transitions, while mediastinal lymph node dissection and division of pulmonary veins were less complex. The number of transitions to three tasks significantly correlated with case duration (fissure dissection (R = 0.69, p = 0.01), dissect arteries (R = 0.59, p = 0.03), and divide arteries (R = 0.63, p = 0.03)). ConclusionThis pilot demonstrates the feasibility of objectively quantifying workflow between RL tasks and introduces entropy as a new metric of task-transition complexity. These innovative measures of surgical workflow enable detailed characterization of a given surgery and might indicate behaviour that impacts case progression. We discuss how these measures can serve as a foundation and be combined with relevant clinical information to better understand factors influencing surgical inefficiency.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for early detection of the effects of glyphosate and glufosinate on weeds. Specific features (bands and vegetation indices [VIs]) were extracted as indicators for glyphosate and glufosinate efficacy. Black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) was used as the model weed and treated with glyphosate or glufosinate at the fourth-leaf stage. Plants were imaged in the laboratory at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after treatment (HAT) with a 204-wavelength (400-1000 nm) hyperspectral camera. The impact of the herbicide treatments on the spectral reflectance values was analyzed using the two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, followed by classification with a machine learning (ML) model applied on the full spectrum and on 12 VIs. In addition, the contribution of the different wavelengths (features) to classification accuracy was assessed using a feature selection process. For glufosinate, 95% classification accuracy was observed as early as 6 HAT, with four features from the green region required. For glyphosate, four features from the red, red-edge, and green regions were used to achieve 88% classification accuracy at 24 HAT. The accuracy of VIs-based classification was generally lower than that of the full spectrum classification accuracy. Above 85% classification accuracy was achieved only at later imaging campaigns, starting at 48 HAT. This study thus demonstrates that non-optimal application of glyphosate and glufosinate can indeed be detected using spectral imaging.

The excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA correlates with fear memory, and the afterhyperpolarization current (I-AHP) mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel subtype 2 (SK2) dominates the excitability of glutamatergicneurons. This study aimed to explore the effect of MPP2 interacts with SK2 in the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA and the extinction of conditioned fear in mice. MethodsFear memory was analyzed via freezing percentage. Western blotting and fluorescence quantitative PCR were used to determine the expression of protein and mRNA respectively. Electrophysiology was employed to measure the excitability of glutamatergic neurons and I-AHP. ResultsFear conditioning decreased the levels of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA, which were restored following fear extinction. Notably, reduced expression of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA during fear conditioning was caused by the increased activity of protein kinase A (PKA), while increased levels of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA during fear extinction were mediated by interactions with membrane-palmitoylated protein 2 (MPP2). ConclusionsOur results revealed that MPP2 interacts with the SK2 channels and rescues the excitability of glutamatergic neurons by increasing the expression of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA to promote the normalization of anxiety disorders and provide a new direction for the treatment.

Herein, a high-performance liquid-free electronic skin (e-skin) is assembled based on the dry poly(ethylene glycol)-based gel and conductive Ti3C2 MXenes that is successfully applied in wearable strain sensors. The fabricated liquid-free e-skin exhibits superior mechanical performance, broad sensing ranges (>1000%), good temperature adaptability, and durable environmental stability. Without extra sealed packaging, the e-skin sensor maintains remarkable cycling stability and retains 98.5% conductivity at room temperature after 6 months. Furthermore, the liquid-free e-skin sensors are utilized to provide individuals with proper guidance on body alignment and posture awareness, fostering the development and maintenance of correct exercise techniques, thus mitigating the likelihood of sports-related injuries. This work provides a novel liquid-free electron-conductive electronic integrated with adhesiveness, stretchability, self-healabilitiy, and antifreezing, which can meet wide application needs from artificial skins to smart interfaces.

However, all clinically used AR inhibitors target the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is highly susceptible to truncations through splicing or mutations that confer drug resistance. Thus, there exists an urgent need for AR inhibitors with novel modes of action. We thus launched a virtual screening of an ultra-large chemical library to find novel inhibitors of the AR DNA-binding domain (DBD) at two sites: protein-DNA interface (P-box) and dimerization site (D-box). The compounds selected through vigorous computational filtering were then experimentally validated. We identified several novel chemotypes that effectively suppress transcriptional activity of AR and its splice variant V7. The identified compounds represent previously unexplored chemical scaffolds with a mechanism of action that evades the conventional drug resistance manifested through LBD mutations. Additionally, we describe the binding features required to inhibit AR DBD at both P-box and D-box target sites.

However, the exosomes effects in functional dyspepsia (FD) are still fragmentary. Here we examined the role of Eosinophil and mast cell derived-exosomes in FD progression. MethodsFifty FD subjects and age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this retrospective cohort study. Duodenal mucosa and gastric juice were collected to analyze molecular difference. Eosinophil and mast cell were evaluated by immunofluorescence and microarray was subjected to examine the expression levels of NEAT1, miR-211-5p, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which were subsequently were tested by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) validation cohorts. CCK-8 assays, and wound healing assays were used to evaluate integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier in vitro. Rats' weights and gastric emptying rates were used as evaluation of FD severity in vivo. ResultsEosinophil and mast cell were enriched and secreted more exosomes in duodenal mucosa of FD patients. We identified differential lncRNAs that were consistently and significantly up regulated in FD cases. Of these, NEAT1 was further validated by RT-qPCR and had closely relationship with GDNF. MiR-211-5p level was found to be reduced in FD and negatively related with NEAT1 and GDNF. Furthermore, NEAT1and GDNF relived FD while miR-211-5p made symptoms worse. The NEAT1/miR-211-5p/GDNF axis had a good predictive ability for FD. ConclusionsThe NEAT1/miR-211-5p/GDNF could be a potential FD biomarker.

The RNA-binding protein Hu antigen R (HuR) could be a potential therapeutic target to enhance the chemotherapy efficacy. HuR is known to mainly stabilize its target mRNAs, and/or promote the translation of encoded proteins, which are implicated in multiple cancer hallmarks, including chemoresistance. In this study, a docetaxel-resistant cell subline (231-TR) was established from the human TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Both the parental and resistant cell lines exhibited similar sensitivity to the small molecule functional inhibitor of HuR, KH-3. Docetaxel and KH-3 combination therapy synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in TNBC cells and tumor growth in three animal models. KH-3 downregulated the expression levels of HuR targets (e.g., beta-Catenin and BCL2) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, KH-3 restored docetaxel's effects on activating Caspase-3 and cleaving PARP in 231-TR cells, induced apoptotic cell death, and caused S-phase cell cycle arrest. Together, our findings suggest that HuR is a critical mediator of docetaxel resistance and provide a rationale for combining HuR inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents to enhance chemotherapy efficacy.

However, the existed disadvantage such as complex fabrication process, single stimulus source, and the requirement of artificial energy restrict their further development. Herein, a MXene/polyethylene (PE)-based soft actuator with multistimulus response and the ability to be driven by natural sunlight and human humidity is proposed through a simple method. Owing to the excellent electrical conductivity, high photothermal conversion capability, and surface hydrophilicity of MXene, the MXene/PE actuator exhibits rapid and large bending deformation in response to external multistimuli such as light, electricity, heat, and humidity. Owing to the simple preparation, and anisotropic, tailorable and programmable properties of the MXene/PE actuator, a soft robot that can crawl directionally under light conditions is constructed. In addition, based on the high sensitivity response of the actuator to light and humidity, smart clothing that can generate reversible bending deformation under natural sunlight as well as sweat conditions is developed. These results provide a new inspiration for the design of high-performance soft actuators with multistimulus response, and demonstrate the potential applications of the MXene/PE actuators in smart devices, bionic robots, and wearable clothing.

The present study exhibits that Daboxin P also inhibits platelet aggregation induced by various agonists. The thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited maximum whereas inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation was found to be 50% and no inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation was observed. Daboxin P dose-dependently inhibited the thrombin-induced platelet aggregation with Anti-Aggregation 50 (AD(50)) dose of 55.166 nM and also reduced the thrombin-mediated calcium influx. In-silico interaction studies suggested that Daboxin P binds to thrombin and blocks its interaction with its receptor on the platelet surface. Quenching of thrombin's emission spectrum by Daboxin P and electrophoretic profiles of pull-down assay further reveals the binding between Daboxin P and thrombin. Thus, the present study demonstrates that Daboxin P inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to thrombin.

In this work, the halide exchange strategy is examined for deep-blue PeLEDs, with a focus on understanding the role of the organic cations of the halide salt (i.e., the chloride source for ion exchange) in modifying the properties of the perovskite films and consequently the PeLED performances. By comparatively investigating the treatment effects of two model systems, namely phenethylammonium chloride and 2,2-diphenylethylammonium chloride (DPEACl), it is found that although the two chlorides produce highly similar photoluminescence properties of the perovskite films, they create different landscapes for current flow in the PeLEDs. In particular, the bulky branch-structured DPEA cations exhibit minimal disturbance to the perovskite grains while providing highly effective inter-grain void filling and thus leakage current blocking, leading to 3D perovskite-based PeLEDs with a record high peak external quantum efficiency of 6.4% at 462 nm. The study highlights the importance of organic cation selection in the halide exchange processes for PeLEDs.

J	D'Agruma, N				D'Agruma, Nicolo			From the epistemic perspectives in experimental semantics to the ambiguity of proper names: Is the inference warranted? A critical notice of Jincai Li's <i>The referential mechanism of proper names</i>	MIND & LANGUAGE			English	Review; Early Access						ambiguity; cross-cultural variability; epistemic perspectives; experimental semantics; proper names; theory of reference		In her engaging book, The referential mechanism of proper names, Li presents empirical studies involving American and Chinese laypeople. Li interprets her results as supporting an epistemic-perspective reading of the variability in referential intuitions on proper names. Building upon this thesis, Li defends the ambiguity view, claiming that names are ambiguous between a descriptivist and a causal-historical meaning. I argue that either Li's data do not enable a comparison of the two theories of reference, or support for the ambiguity view is limited to the Chinese sample at most and does not rely upon the inference that Li employs.

Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation and elevated mortality following heatwaves	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; Crassostrea gigas; functional genomics; multiple stressors; physiological tolerance; triploid mortality	CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS THUNBERG; METABOLIC-RATE; CELL-SIZE; ADENOSINE-TRIPHOSPHATASE; ACCLIMATION TEMPERATURE; REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; SEXUAL-MATURATION; CADMIUM EXPOSURE; VIBRIO INFECTION; MYTILUS-EDULIS	Polyploidy has been suggested to negatively impact environmental stress tolerance, resulting in increased susceptibility to extreme climate events. In this study, we compared the genomic and physiological response of diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to conditions present during an atmospheric heatwave that impacted the Pacific Northwestern region of the United States in the summer of 2021. Climate stressors were applied either singly (single stressor; elevated seawater temperature, 30?) or in succession (multiple stressor; elevated seawater temperature followed by aerial emersion at 44?), replicating conditions present within the intertidal over a tidal cycle during the event. Oyster mortality rate was elevated within stress treatments with respect to the control and was significantly higher in triploids than diploids following multiple stress exposure (36.4% vs. 14.8%). Triploids within the multiple stressor treatment exhibited signs of energetic limitation, including metabolic depression, a significant reduction in ctenidium Na+/K+ ATPase activity, and the dysregulated expression of genes associated with stress response, innate immunity, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Functional enrichment analysis of ploidy-specific gene sets identified that biological processes associated with metabolism, stress tolerance, and immune function were overrepresented within triploids across stress treatments. Our results suggest that triploidy impacts the transcriptional regulation of key processes that underly the stress response of Pacific oysters, resulting in downstream shifts in physiological tolerance limits that may increase susceptibility to extreme climate events that present multiple environmental stressors. The impact of chromosome set manipulation on the climate resilience of marine organisms has important implications for domestic food security within future climate scenarios, especially as triploidy induction becomes an increasingly popular tool to elicit reproductive control across a wide range of species used within marine aquaculture.

Effectiveness, safety and quality-of-life effects of guselkumab and ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis: Week 104 results from the non-interventional, prospective, German multicentre PERSIST study	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							LONG-TERM EFFICACY; INTERLEUKIN-12/23 MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; DOUBLE-BLIND; MODERATE; TRIAL	BackgroundPERSIST was a prospective, non-interventional, real-world study of guselkumab and ustekinumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in Germany. ObjectivesTo examine effectiveness, safety and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes to Week (W) 104 of treatment with guselkumab and ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. MethodsPatients (& GE;18 years of age) received guselkumab or ustekinumab as per routine clinical practice. Outcomes to W104 were examined separately in guselkumab and ustekinumab recipients. An ad hoc exploratory analysis of outcomes with guselkumab versus ustekinumab was also performed following propensity score matching. ResultsOverall, 302 and 313 patients received guselkumab and ustekinumab, respectively. Patients in both cohorts experienced improvements in disease activity and QoL that were maintained to W104, with 64.7% and 63.6% of guselkumab- and 54.6% and 64.4% of ustekinumab-treated patients achieving a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 response and a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 0/1 score, respectively. Propensity score matching yielded well-balanced baseline characteristics except for prior biologic use, which was higher in guselkumab versus ustekinumab recipients (51.7% vs. 32.0%). Achievement of PASI & LE;1 at W104 was more common in guselkumab versus ustekinumab recipients (58.7% vs. 49.7%). The W104 PASI90 response rate was 65.6% with guselkumab and 56.0% with ustekinumab; corresponding rates for PASI100 were 44.3% and 28.5%. In guselkumab recipients, response rates were higher in biologic-naive versus biologic-experienced patients (PASI90, 77.1% vs. 53.4%; PASI100, 55.0% vs. 33.0%). A high level of response for QoL outcomes was observed for both treatments. ConclusionsUstekinumab and guselkumab led to improvements in physician-assessed and patient-reported outcomes that were sustained for up to 2 years, with no new safety signals identified. Following propensity score matching, greater improvements in PASI outcomes were observed with guselkumab versus ustekinumab. Improvements with guselkumab were highest in biologic-naive patients, highlighting the value of early treatment.

Against this background, deeper insights into bacterial interaction with antibiotic drugs are urgently required, whereas fluorescently labeled drug conjugates can serve as highly valuable tools. Herein, the preparation and biological evaluation of 13 new fluorescent antibiotic-Cy5 dye conjugates is described, in which the tuning of the polarity of the Cy5 dye proved to be a key element to achieve highly favorable properties for various fields of application.

J	Gutierrez, KC				Gutierrez, Kathleen Cruz			From objects of study to worldmaking beings: The history of botany at the corner of the plant turn	HISTORY COMPASS			English	Article								The "plant turn" of recent years has surfaced as an interdisciplinary position that sees plants as more than inert, passive objects subject to the whims of humans and of more charismatic animal life. Recent research in STEM, the social sciences, and the humanities, alongside scholarly publishing pursuits, have opened a field in which a small yet expanding community of scholars are proposing the worldmaking and agential capacities of plants. While the field of environmental history has already spent decades centering vegetal life and its profound impact on human societies, this essay considers what the plant turn might look like for the history of science and more specifically, the history of botany. What might it mean for plants to transform from objects of study to worldmaking beings in histories of the science? Drawing on two brief historical case studies from the Philippines, the essay invites consideration of plant worldmaking, understood in tandem with alternative ontologies, and of theorizing with plants. Though it may be much too soon to draw conclusions about what the plant turn may portend for the history of science (and the writing that may come from it), historians may have something to offer the plant turn-in discipline and method-in order to make this promising bed of scholarship rigorous and accessible.

The purpose of this study was to determine the utility, reliability, and cost of routine chest imaging to identify these anatomical variations.Methods: Data were collected retrospectively at a tertiary medical center for patients who were undergoing CT chest for various indications between October 2019 and October 2020. Two independent and blinded readers interpreted CT chest with contrast of 52 patients for a total 104 sides.Results: The proximal branching pattern of the subscapular system was identified to have a common trunk in 99 (95%) sides. The remaining five sides (5%) demonstrated two arterial pedicles; with one patient exhibiting the variant anatomy bilaterally.Conclusion: Preoperative CT chest with contrast can accurately identify anatomic variation of the subscapular vascular system. For complex reconstruction requiring a single anastomosis in the vessel depleted neck, preoperative imaging can assure selection of a type I vascular anatomy of the proximal subscapular system. Preoperative imaging with contrasted CT has value in assessing this anatomy when planning for chimeric flaps involving circumflex scapular and thoracodorsal arteries.

A descriptive statistical approach, Pearson's correlation analysis and the Hayes' PROCESS Macro model 4 and 14 were used to analyse the available data.Results: Adaptive perfectionism and maladaptive perfectionism negatively and positively predicted academic procrastination in nursing undergraduates, respectively. Self-efficacy played a partially mediating role in the association between adaptive perfectionism and academic procrastination. Furthermore, resilience played a moderating role in the association between adaptive perfectionism and academic procrastination.Conclusions: Maladaptive perfectionism and low levels of resilience and self-efficacy may increase the risk of academic procrastination among nursing undergraduates. Nursing educators can take measures to decrease the risk of academic procrastination among nursing undergraduate students by guiding them to cultivate adaptive perfectionism tendencies and improve their self-efficacy and resilience.Impact: The findings of this study can be used to develop targeted coping and prevention measures for nursing educators to reduce the incidence of academic procrastination among nursing undergraduates.Patient or Public Contribution: Five hundred eighty-seven undergraduate nursing students from two undergraduate universities participated in the study and responded to questions on perfectionism and academic procrastination, etc.	[Huang, Haitao; Ding, Yueming; Wan, Xiao; Peng, Qianwen; Zhang, Yiming; Kong, Deren; Chen, Chaoran] Henan Univ, Inst Nursing & Hlth, Sch Nursing & Hlth, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Liang, Yipei] Henan Univ, Sch Business, Kaifeng, Peoples R China; [Kong, Deren; Chen, Chaoran] Henan Univ, Inst Nursing & Hlth, Sch Nursing & Hlth, Kaifeng, Peoples R China	Henan University; Henan University; Henan University	Kong, DR; Chen, CR (corresponding author), Henan Univ, Inst Nursing & Hlth, Sch Nursing & Hlth, Kaifeng, Peoples R China.	kdr@henu.edu.cn; kfccr@126.com		Huang, Haitao/0000-0002-2396-4959	Graduate Education Reform and Quality Improvement Project of Henan Province [YJS2021AL074]; Graduate Education Innovation and Quality Improvement Project of Henan University [SYL19060141]; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Research Project of Kaifeng City [ZXSKGH- 2022-1363]	Graduate Education Reform and Quality Improvement Project of Henan Province; Graduate Education Innovation and Quality Improvement Project of Henan University; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Research Project of Kaifeng City	Graduate Education Reform and Quality Improvement Project of Henan Province, Grant/Award Number: YJS2021AL074; Graduate Education Innovation and Quality Improvement Project of Henan University, Grant/Award Number: SYL19060141; Philosophy and Social Science Planning Research Project of Kaifeng City, Grant/Award Number: ZXSKGH- 2022-1363		62	0	0	9	9	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA	2054-1058			NURS OPEN	NURS.

Comparison of mortality of brachycephalic dogs undergoing partial staphylectomy using conventional incisional, carbon dioxide laser, or bipolar vessel sealing device	VETERINARY SURGERY			English	Article; Early Access							SOFT PALATE RESECTION; OBSTRUCTIVE AIRWAY SYNDROME; SURGICAL-CORRECTION; SURGERY; COMPLICATIONS; RISK	ObjectiveTo compare mortality of dogs undergoing partial staphylectomy using conventional incisional, carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, and bipolar vessel sealing device (BVSD) techniques for the treatment of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS). Study designRetrospective multicenter cohort study. AnimalsA total of 606 client-owned English bulldogs, French bulldogs, and pugs. MethodsMedical records from 2011 to 2021 were reviewed for signalment, history, surgical technique, length of hospitalization, and complications. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to compare odds of mortality between the three techniques of staphylectomy. ResultsThe overall mortality rate was 24/606 (4.0%). Of those 24 dogs, staphylectomy was performed with BVSD technique in 13 cases, with CO2 laser in nine, and using conventional incisional technique in two. Nine dogs were graded II or III laryngeal collapse, 14 were graded I, and one was unknown. BVSD technique was associated with mortality prior to discharge compared to the other two techniques (OR = 6.0, 95% CI: 1.3-28.4, p = .023). No differences were detected between conventional incisional and CO2 laser techniques. Concurrent higher grade (stage II or III) laryngeal collapse was independently associated with mortality prior to discharge (OR = 4.6, 95% CI: 1.8-11.8, p = .002). ConclusionThe use of BVSD and grade of laryngeal collapse were associated with a higher risk of perioperative mortality. Clinical significanceClinical studies using a randomized trial design should be conducted to further determine the putative influence of surgical instrumentation in the perioperative mortality rate following multilevel surgery in dogs with BOAS.

Contextual factors contributing to variability within middle school teachers' observed classroom management and student engagement	PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS			English	Article						classroom context; classroom diversity; classroom management; intraindividual variability; student engagement	DISCIPLINE GAP; CLASS SIZE; ACHIEVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; TIME; TRAJECTORIES; EXPECTATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; STRATEGIES; ATTITUDES	Teachers' classroom management practices are an essential aspect of supporting student engagement, yet they often vary in response to changing conditions in the classroom. This study explored the variability within middle school teachers' observed practice and their students' engagement as a function of contextual factors. Observers visited teachers (n = 278) on three occasions, typically over the course of two consecutive school days using two consecutively-administered observational tools (n = 1582 total observations). Multilevel regression models and multiple comparison adjustments suggested teachers' emotional support and student cooperation declined over time during the morning hours. Small group work, individual seat work, and "other" instructional groupings were often associated with less desirable outcomes than whole group instruction. Finally, most teacher practice and student engagement outcomes were rated more favorably when observers perceived a larger proportion of the students in the classroom to be White. Implications are discussed for observational measures in research and practice and for improvements in teachers' classroom management practices, particularly when working with students of color.

J	Kumar, SM; Venkatachalam, R				Kumar, Sunil Mitra; Venkatachalam, Ragupathy			Poor economics and its missing mechanisms: The case for causal mediation	REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS			English	Article; Early Access						causal mechanisms; causal mediation; development economics	LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; INFERENCE; INTERSECTIONALITY; RANDOMIZATION; CASEWORKERS; EXPLAINS	A key aim of studying development is to understand the factors that shape socioeconomic progress and explain inequalities. In empirical work, the predominant focus has been on posing these questions in the language of causal inference: how one or more variables effect an outcome of interest, with the estimation of Average Treatment Effects (ATE) becoming prioritised as the key objective. The 'credibility revolution' and the emphasis on randomised controlled trials in research on development has cemented this dominance, because randomisation is well-suited to estimating the ATE. This paper argues that this dual dominance-ATE as main question of interest, and experiment as preferred method-is narrow and restrictive. We propose causal mediation frameworks as an alternative, which are routinely used in disciplines including epidemiology, psychology, sociology and political science where causal mechanisms are an equally important focus. We introduce key concepts and definitions of path-specific effects, and discuss identification and estimation approaches. We illustrate applications for development and demonstrate how causal mediation brings the focus back to contextual knowledge, combining this with empirical rigour.

Side-Chain Tailoring of Fluorene-Based Hole-Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells	SOLAR RRL			English	Article; Early Access						computed interfacial electric field; hole-transport materials; interfacial charge transfer; n-i-p perovskite solar cells; twisted side chains	LOW-COST; ELECTRON; DYNAMICS	The functionalization of small-molecule hole-transport materials (HTMs) heavily relies on the rational design of molecular geometry, which can optimize both intrinsic HTM properties and interfacial properties for realizing high-performance and stable lead halide perovskite solar cells (LHPSCs). Herein, two fluorene-based donor-& pi; linker-donor HTMs are seen, FL01 and FL02, whose side chains are tailored with planar phenyl-carbazole groups and twisted triphenylamine groups, respectively. Benefiting from the high conformational flexibility of twisted side chains, the strong and oriented interaction via Pb-O bonding is well coordinated at the perovskite and FL02 interface, which favors the interfacial charge transfer as well as the protection of perovskite layer by effectively blocking or mitigating the diffusion of hygroscopic dopants toward the perovskite surface. Consequently, the performance of FL02 HTM-based n-i-p LHPSCs is significantly enhanced by achieving a power conversion efficiency of 17.8%, which is twice higher than that (8.6%) of FL01 HTM-based ones and comparable with the case (18.8%) of conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTM-based devices. More importantly, the FL02-based devices exhibit impressively high operation and storage stabilities with T80 and TS80 lifetimes of >98 h and & AP;270 days, respectively, which are among the longest lifespans for the type of hygroscopically doped LHPSCs.

MethodsA pilot study with control and intervention groups was conducted using the complex intervention framework in two primary healthcare centres. Overall, 44 childbearing women, their partners/relatives and 20 healthcare professionals participated in the study. The intervention's feasibility and acceptability were measured. The percentage of exclusive breastfeeding rates and women's self-efficacy were measured at pre-intervention, at 10 days postpartum, and again at 2, 4 and 6 months postpartum. Postpartum depression risk was measured at 2 and 6 months postpartum. Professional self-efficacy was measured at pre-intervention and 3 months later. ResultsThe intervention was feasible and acceptable. No difference in self-efficacy existed between the intervention and control groups. Preliminary effects of the intervention were found in exclusive breastfeeding percentage and postpartum depression risk in the intervention group. ConclusionThe intervention is feasible and acceptable. The results are promising not only for breastfeeding maintenance but also for preventing postpartum depression and recovering exclusive breastfeeding during pandemics.

Levonorgestrel (LNG) 1.5 mg is widely available as emergency contraception pills (ECP), and recent research has shown that certain women take it as their main form of contraception. Furthermore, limited studies have found repeat, on-demand use safe and efficacious.This 12-month prospective, single-arm, interventional study in Ghana tested whether a single LNG 1.5 mg on-demand or pericoital ("around the time of sex") dose contraceptive was acceptable to women who have infrequent sex and if pharmacy provision was feasible. The study sample (1,890) comprised women of reproductive age recruited from urban areas, having infrequent sex (i.e., coital frequency & LE; 6x per month), and not using any other modern methods except condoms or ECP at the time of study inclusion.Results indicated that there is demand and acceptability for a pericoital pill and that pharmacy provision is feasible. Furthermore, precoital use of the pill had high levels of satisfaction and was popular with new users. Adding LNG 1.5 mg for pericoital use to the family planning method mix has the potential to address an important segment of the population currently underserved, decreases unwanted pregnancies, and increases modern contraceptive prevalence rates.

The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium-catalyzed one-pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono- and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near-infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P- or M-helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|g(abs)|& GE;0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.

Poor Concordance of One-Third Anterior-Posterior Chest Diameter Measurements With Absolute Age-Specific Chest Compression Depth Targets in Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Patients	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						cardiac arrest; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; chest compressions; pediatrics	HEART-ASSOCIATION GUIDELINES; CARDIOPULMONARY-RESUSCITATION; LIFE-SUPPORT; CHILDREN; QUALITY; CONSENSUS; SCIENCE	BACKGROUND: Current pediatric cardiac arrest guidelines recommend depressing the chest by one-third anterior-posterior diameter (APD), which is presumed to equate to absolute age-specific chest compression depth targets (4 cm for infants and 5 cm for children). However, no clinical studies during pediatric cardiac arrest have validated this presumption. We aimed to study the concordance of measured one-third APD with absolute age-specific chest compression depth targets in a cohort of pediatric patients with cardiac arrest. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective observational study from a multicenter, pediatric resuscitation quality collaborative (pediRES-Q [Pediatric Resuscitation Quality Collaborative]) from October 2015 to March 2022. In-hospital patients with cardiac arrest <= 12 years old with APD measurements recorded were included for analysis. One hundred eighty-two patients (118 infants >28 days old to <1 year old, and 64 children 1 to 12 years old) were analyzed. The mean one-third APD of infants was 3.2cm (SD, 0.7 cm), which was significantly smaller than the 4 cm target depth (P<0.001). Seventeen percent of the infants had one-third APD measurements within the 4 cm +/- 10% target range. For children, the mean one-third APD was 4.3 cm (SD, 1.1 cm). Thirty-nine percent of children had one-third APD within the 5 cm +/- 10% range. Except for children 8 to 12 years old and overweight children, the measured mean one-third APD of the majority of the children was significantly smaller than the 5cm depth target (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was poor concordance between measured one-third APD and absolute age-specific chest compression depth targets, particularly for infants. Further study is needed to validate current pediatric chest compression depth targets and evaluate the optimal chest compression depth to improve cardiac arrest outcomes.	[Ong, Gene Y.

NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						arm muscle circumference; cancer; hospitalization; malnutrition; pediatrics	NUTRITIONAL-STATUS; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; DIAGNOSIS; TOOLS	BackgroundMalnutrition is common in children/adolescents with cancer. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is recommended by the International Society of Pediatric Oncology for measuring nutrition status. The aim was to evaluate the nutrition status of pediatric patients with cancer and verify whether MUAC is associated with malnutrition and length of stay (LOS). MethodsThis was an observational study of patients aged 0-19 years with solid and hematological neoplasms. Data included anthropometric measurements of nutrition status by body mass index/age (BMI/A), weight/age, weight/height, height/age, MUAC, mid-arm muscle circumference, triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), and biochemical measurements of characterizing inflammation (serum prealbumin level, serum albumin level, and C-reactive protein [CRP]). Statistical tests such as the Student t test, Mann-Whitney test, and Spearman correlation were employed to analyze the data. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis. ResultsOf 111 patients, 51.7% (n = 57) were male, and solid tumors were prevalent (76.6%, n = 85). The median age was 8.5 years. The anthropometric measurements of the arm revealed a higher prevalence of malnutrition when compared with anthropometric indices. According to the Spearman correlation, a high and positive correlation was observed between MUAC and BMI/A (& rho; = 0.800 and P < 0.001). There was an association between MUAC, TSF, and high CRP with LOS (P = 0.025, P = 0.003, and P < 0.001, respectively). Patients with a MUAC (less than the fifth percentile) had almost 2.73 times the chance of having a prolonged LOS. ConclusionMUAC was a good parameter for the classification of nutrition status and the assessment of LOS in pediatric patients with cancer.

Inter-individual differences in such stress-related drinking can be assessed through psychometric scales; however, available questionnaires conflate stress- with emotion-related reasons to drink and ignore evidence of decreased alcohol consumption in response to stress. Therefore, we developed a genuine stress-drinking scale (Salzburg Stress Drinking Scale; SSDS), adapted from the Salzburg Stress Eating Scale, and assessed its psychometric properties. In study 1 (n = 639), the SSDS was found to have a one-factor structure, excellent internal consistency, and acceptable test-retest reliability. SSDS scores were significantly correlated with other measures assessing emotional drinking, but uncorrelated with general alcohol pathology and other health-relevant consummatory behaviors such as stress-related eating or nicotine consumption. In addition, no significant sex differences arose. In study 2 (n = 42) patients with an alcohol use disorder or addiction scored significantly higher on the SSDS compared to healthy controls. In an Ecological Momentary Assessment study 3 (n = 67), the SSDS showed partial ecological validity through significant relationships with daily alcohol consumption, but not daily stress-drinking relationships. In sum, the SSDS represents a psychometrically sound tool for the measurement of stress-related drinking and complements a battery of stress-related changes in health-relevant behaviors.

Polyphenol Oxidase Products Are Priming Agents for LPMO Peroxygenase Activity	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase; monophenol; peroxygenase; polyphenol oxidase; priming reduction	LYTIC POLYSACCHARIDE MONOOXYGENASES; DEGRADATION; TYROSINASE; OXIDATION; ENZYMES; LIGNIN	Polyphenol oxidases catalyze the hydroxylation of monophenols to diphenols, which are reducing agents for lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in their degradation of cellulose. In particular, the polyphenol oxidase MtPPO7 from Myceliophthora thermophila converts lignocellulose-derived monophenols, and under the new perspective of the peroxygenase reaction catalyzed by LPMOs, we aim to differentiate the role of the catalytic products of MtPPO7 in priming and fueling of LPMO activity. Exemplified by the activity of MtPPO7 towards guaiacol and by using the benchmark LPMO NcAA9C from Neurospora crassa we show that MtPPO7 catalytic products provide the initial electron for the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) but cannot provide the required reducing power for continuous fueling of the LPMO. The priming reaction is shown to occur with catalytic amounts of MtPPO7 products and those compounds do not generate substantial amounts of H2O2 in situ to fuel the LPMO peroxygenase activity. Reducing agents with a low propensity to generate H2O2 can provide the means for controlling the LPMO catalysis through exogenous H2O2 and thereby minimize any enzyme inactivation.

MethodsData on pharmacotherapy, demographics, diagnostic subtypes, and comorbidities were provided from each participating cohort. Individual site and regional pooled proportional meta-analyses with generalized linear mixed methods were conducted to identify prescription patterns. ResultsThis study included 10,351 individuals from North America (n = 3985), Europe (n = 3822), and Australia (n = 2544). Overall, participants were predominantly female (60%) with BD-I (60%; vs. BD-II = 33%). Cross-sectionally, mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants (44%), second-generation antipsychotics (42%), and antidepressants (38%) were the most prescribed medications. Lithium was prescribed in 29% of patients, primarily in the Australian (31%) and European (36%) cohorts. First-generation antipsychotics were prescribed in 24% of the European versus 1% in the North American cohort. Antidepressant prescription rates were higher in BD-II (47%) compared to BD-I (35%). Major limitations were significant differences among cohorts based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, data source, and time/year of enrollment into cohort. ConclusionsMood-stabilizing anticonvulsants, second-generation antipsychotics, and antidepressants were the most prescribed medications suggesting prescription patterns that are not necessarily guideline concordant. Significant differences exist in the prescription practices across different geographic regions, especially the underutilization of lithium in the North American cohorts and the higher utilization of first-generation antipsychotics in the European cohorts. There is a need to conduct future longitudinal studies to further explore these differences and their impact on outcomes, and to inform and implement evidence-based guidelines to help improve treatment practices in BD.

Eleven populations collected from Czech oilseed rape fields during 2018-2021 were tested for susceptibility to 11 insecticides. The presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) leading to knockdown resistance in M. persicae populations was screened using allelic discriminating quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The presence of mutations related with the resistance of M. persicae to pyrethroids and carbamates was detected by sequencing paratype voltage-gated sodium channel and acetylcholinesterase 2 genes, respectively. ResultsResistance to alpha-cypermethrin and pirimicarb was detected in most of the tested populations. The L1014F mutation was detected in 44.5% of M. persicae individuals surviving the field-recommended dose of alpha-cypermethrin. Sequencing of partial para gene for paratype voltage-gated sodium channel detected five different SNPs leading to four amino acid substitutions (kdr L1014F; s-kdr M918L; s-kdr M918T; and L932F). No pyrethroid-sensitive genotype was detected. The S431F amino acid substitution conferring resistance to carbamates was detected in 11 of 20 individuals with different pyrethroid-resistance genotypes. ConclusionResistance of M. persicae to both pyrethroids and carbamates was detected in nine of 11 populations. High resistance of M. persicae was correlated with mutations of the sodium channel. Sulfoxaflor, flonicamid, and spirotetramat are proposed as effective compounds to control pyrethroid- and carbamate-resistant populations of M. persicae. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Although many efforts have been devoted to photoswitch discovery, the solar efficiency, a critical fundamental parameter assessing the solar energy conversion ability, has attracted little attention and remains to be studied comprehensively. Here we provide a systematic evaluation of the solar efficiency of typical azo-switches including azobenzenes and azopyrazoles, and gain a comprehensive understanding on its decisive factors. All the efficiencies are found below 1.0 %, far from the proposed limits for molecular solar thermal energy storage systems. Azopyrazoles exhibit remarkably higher solar efficiencies (0.59-0.94 %) than azobenzenes (0.11-0.43 %), benefiting from largely improved quantum yield and photoisomerization yield. Light filters can be used to improve the isomerization yield but inevitably narrow the usable range of solar spectrum, and these two contradictory effects ultimately reduce solar efficiencies. We envision this conflict could be resolved through developing azo-switches that afford high isomerization yields by absorbing wide-spectrum solar energy. We hope this work could promote more efforts to improve the solar efficiency of photoswitches, which is highly relevant to the prospect for future applications.

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Standing Test in Adults Suspected for Congenital Long-QT Syndrome	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						ECG; LQTS; QTc; QT interval	T-WAVE PATTERNS; GUIDELINES; INTERVAL; ECG; ASSOCIATION; MANAGEMENT; VARIANTS; SPECTRUM; FORMS	BackgroundAn elegant bedside provocation test has been shown to aid the diagnosis of long-QT syndrome (LQTS) in a retrospective cohort by evaluation of QT intervals and T-wave morphology changes resulting from the brief tachycardia provoked by standing. We aimed to prospectively determine the potential diagnostic value of the standing test for LQTS. Methods and ResultsIn adults suspected for LQTS who had a standing test, the QT interval was assessed manually and automated. In addition, T-wave morphology changes were determined. A total of 167 controls and 131 genetically confirmed patients with LQTS were included. A prolonged heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) (men & GE;430 ms, women & GE;450 ms) at baseline before standing yielded a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI, 47-74) in men and 54% (95% CI, 42-66) in women, with a specificity of 90% (95% CI, 80-96) and 89% (95% CI, 81-95), respectively. In both men and women, QTc & GE;460 ms after standing increased sensitivity (89% [95% CI, 83-94]) but decreased specificity (49% [95% CI, 41-57]). Sensitivity further increased (P<0.01) when a prolonged baseline QTc was accompanied by a QTc & GE;460 ms after standing in both men (93% [95% CI, 84-98]) and women (90% [95% CI, 81-96]). However, the area under the curve did not improve. T-wave abnormalities after standing did not further increase the sensitivity or the area under the curve significantly. ConclusionsDespite earlier retrospective studies, a baseline ECG and the standing test in a prospective evaluation displayed a different diagnostic profile for congenital LQTS but no unequivocal synergism or advantage. This suggests that there is markedly reduced penetrance and incomplete expression in genetically confirmed LQTS with retention of repolarization reserve in response to the brief tachycardia provoked by standing.

There is solid evidence that binge-eating behaviors are also prevalent in adolescence, but knowledge about mental health in community adolescents with BED of different frequency thresholds is more limited. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and mental health problems associated with SBED of low frequency and/or limited duration compared with BED in a Danish community sample of adolescents. MethodsWe included 2509 adolescents who completed the online survey of the 16-17-year follow-up of the Copenhagen Child Cohort (CCC2000), including items on BED symptoms approximating the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, and items on mental health and quality of life. ResultsThe 1-year prevalence of SBED was 2.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0%-3.3%) with a male:female ratio of 1:3.7; comparable to previous findings on BED in the same sample. SBED was also comparable to BED concerning cross-sectional associations with overall mental health problems, lower health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation, whereas no associations were seen with non-suicidal self-injury after Holm-Bonferroni correction. In both groups, thoughts and behaviors concerning food and weight interfered significantly with daily life. DiscussionSBED and BED were equally prevalent in this adolescent community sample, and similarly associated with indicators of poor mental health. The findings indicate that community adolescents reporting symptoms approximating clinical criteria of BED need intervention irrespectively of symptom frequency or duration. Public SignificanceThis study adds knowledge to the field by comparing BED of low frequency and/or limited duration ("subthreshold BED," SBED) with full-syndrome BED in adolescents and showing that SBED in adolescence is both prevalent and associated with poor mental health to a similar extent as that of BED. Findings indicate that self-reported symptoms according to clinical criteria of SBED and BED alike constitute a public health problem and point to youngsters in need of intervention.

Recruitment used purposive and snowball sampling. Participants completed a demographic survey and semi-structured interviews that were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. A cross-cultural examination occurred among researchers from each country.Results: The result was described (n = 35) by the themes, representing the essences of each lifeworld (relationship, time, space and body). The nurses' lived experience was one of reframing care while enduring repeated trauma of witnessing disrupted patient-family-nurse relationships. Themes were as follows: (a) Living a silent and lonely experience; (b) Providing connectedness for disrupted patient and family relationships; (c) Feeling the burden of the demands; (d) Being a helping connector; (e) Reshaping spaces amidst evolving interventions and policies; (f) Creating safe spaces, surrounded by turmoil, threat, and distress within an unsafe environment; (g) Reorganizing care and reframing time; (h) Reconciling losses, regrets, victories and lessons.Conclusion: The nurses' lived experience of caring for patients and families during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the need to respond to repeated traumas and distress posed by interrupted patient-family and nurse-own family relationships, vulnerable bodies, threatened space and dynamic and volatile time.Impact: Cultural nuances were discovered depending on the practice setting, political discourse and the autonomy of the nurse. Innovative models of care that create structures and processes to support nurses in caring for patients in threatening environments and the commitment to connecting family members have potential to contribute to the ongoing health of the nursing profession.

Results showed that the annual average PM2.5 mass concentrations were average 65.02 mu g/m(3) which significantly exceeded the annual National Ambient Air Quality Standards (40 mu g/m(3)) by similar to 1.6 times. In addition, PM2.5 and WSIIs mass concentrations exhibited significant seasonal variability with the highest average concentrations observed during winter and the least during monsoon. Furthermore, WSIIs accounted for 24.56% of PM2.5 mass annually. Cl-, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ depicted higher concentrations in summer whereas higher mass concentrations of SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ observed during winter pointed to their formation from gas to particulate conversion mechanisms. The variability of source strength during peak tourist seasons in holidays, festivities and new year appears to have significantly accounted for high PM2.5 in the study area. Additionally, meteorological conditions also appear to have played an important role in secondary aerosol formation which is noticeable from the high correlation observed among SO42--NO3- (0.97), NH4+ - SO42- (0.69), K+-Cl- (0.85), NH4+-NO3- (0.64), SO42-- K+ (0.63), NH4+-Cl- (0.65) at p <.05 during winter. On the other hand, significant correlations (p <.01) observed between Ca2+ - Mg2+ (0.94), SO42- - Ca2+ (0.78) and SO42--Mg2+ (0.89) during summer indicated their primary origin as crustal-based sources.

Design: This qualitative study used a care ethical approach in which empirical data and care ethical theory were dialectically related and mutually informing. Methods: Fifteen close family members of nursing home residents with dementia were interviewed between February 2020 and October 2020. Forty-two interviews were conducted, based on a semi-structured open-ended design. A thematic narrative approach combined with the five phases of care as defined by Tronto was used to analyse the empirical data. Subsequently, Tronto's identified ethical qualities were used to identify the moral dimension of these empirical findings. Results: We found that in the care process (1) family can find it difficult to recognize their loved one's care needs; (2) both family and staff are reluctant to discuss the allocation of responsibilities with each other; (3) family sometimes feels insecure when it comes to connecting with their loved one; (4) family is often reluctant to provide feedback to staff when they are critical about the care that has been given; and (5) family is generally mild in judging staff, due to staff shortages. The care ethical interpretation of these findings showed that the moral qualities of attentiveness, responsibility, competence, responsiveness, and solidarity are under pressure to a certain extent. Conclusion: Family experiences moral distress during the care process, which hinders family involvement in nursing homes for people with dementia. Conclusion: Family experiences moral distress during the care process, which hinders family involvement in nursing homes for people with dementia. Impact: Nursing home staff can look for and pilot strategies focused on supporting families to act more in accordance with the moral qualities that are under pressure. This can improve family involvement in practice. Patient or Public Contribution: No Patient/Public Contribution. Implications for Practice/Policy: Nursing home staff paying more attention to families' emotional struggles related to the decline of their loved one, could help families to be more attentive to noticing true care needs of the resident. Both family and nursing home staff should take more often initiatives to evaluate the division of care responsibilities with each other. Nursing home staff should help family connect with their loved one during their visits if they experience difficulties in doing so. Nursing home staff taking more often initiatives to contact family and ask them how they perceive the care for their loved one, can positively affect the responsiveness of both family and staff. It would be helpful if nursing home management could ensure the presence of sufficient and qualified staff so that the first four phases of the care process are not hindered by the lack of staff.

This study investigates (i) the effects of these RD measures on the Cost of Capital (COC), (ii) the influence of analysts' coverage on the relationship between RD and COC, and (iii) whether the RD nature (favourable/unfavourable) might affect COC differently. Lenders and equity holders are found not to consider any risk information expressed as a variation around a target, while only lenders consider risk information that reveals negative outcomes. However, lenders and equity holders consider risk information that expresses negative and positive outcomes together. Besides, firms that disclose extra risk information and have a large analyst following suffer from a higher Cost of Equity (COE) compared with those with fewer analysts following. Additionally, lenders impose a lower interest rate on firms with a higher unfavourable RD, while equity holders ask for lower returns from the firms with a higher favourable RD. The study has significant implications for capital market participants, researchers, and policymakers.

Structural insights into hydrolytic defluorination of difluoroacetate by microbial fluoroacetate dehalogenases	FEBS JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						crystal structure; Dechloromonas aromatica; difluoroacetate; fluoroacetate dehalogenase; hydrolytic defluorination	CARBOXYLIC-ACIDS PFCAS; CARBON-FLUORINE BOND; CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS; CATALYTIC MECHANISM; BIOTRANSFORMATION; DEGRADATION; ENZYMES; PHARMACEUTICALS; ELECTROSTATICS; SPECIFICITY	Fluorine forms the strongest single bond to carbon with the highest bond dissociation energy among natural products. However, fluoroacetate dehalogenases (FADs) have been shown to hydrolyze this bond in fluoroacetate under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, two recent studies demonstrated that the FAD RPA1163 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris can also accept bulkier substrates. In this study, we explored the substrate promiscuity of microbial FADs and their ability to defluorinate polyfluorinated organic acids. Enzymatic screening of eight purified dehalogenases with reported fluoroacetate defluorination activity revealed significant hydrolytic activity against difluoroacetate in three proteins. Product analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identified glyoxylic acid as the final product of enzymatic DFA defluorination. The crystal structures of DAR3835 from Dechloromonas aromatica and NOS0089 from Nostoc sp. were determined in the apo-state along with the DAR3835 H274N glycolyl intermediate. Structure-based site-directed mutagenesis of DAR3835 demonstrated a key role for the catalytic triad and other active site residues in the defluorination of both fluoroacetate and difluoroacetate. Computational analysis of the dimer structures of DAR3835, NOS0089, and RPA1163 indicated the presence of one substrate access tunnel in each protomer. Moreover, protein-ligand docking simulations suggested similar catalytic mechanisms for the defluorination of both fluoroacetate and difluoroacetate, with difluoroacetate being defluorinated via two consecutive defluorination reactions producing glyoxylate as the final product. Thus, our findings provide molecular insights into substrate promiscuity and catalytic mechanism of FADs, which are promising biocatalysts for applications in synthetic chemistry and bioremediation of fluorochemicals.

The noise generated by such systems can significantly impact human comfort. The multiblade centrifugal fan, as a crucial component of indoor air conditioners, has a significant impact on the performance of the air conditioner. The vortex, which is the primary noise source inside the fan, hinders the aerodynamic noise reduction of the indoor unit. During experimental research and numerical simulation of the indoor unit, the researchers identified the presence of a vortex flow at the outlet of the multiblade centrifugal fan. By analyzing the velocity vector of different cross-sections in the fan, the researchers determined the formation mechanism and influencing factors of the vortex at the fan's outlet. The addition of fairing sheet plates on the volute wall was explored as a vortex suppression method, which proved effective in weakening and suppressing the vortex. The test results showed that under the same air volume, the noise reduction amplitude of the fan equipped with fairing sheet blades was 1.2 dB at an outlet static pressure of 30 Pa and 0.7 dB at an outlet static pressure of 100 Pa. The research findings suggest that the addition of the fairing sheet can effectively reduce the vortex's intensity, improve the performance of the multiblade centrifugal fan, and reduce the noise.

Nevertheless, the conventional polarization-separated detection behavior in the terahertz (THz) band is very challenging when applied to visualize the incident polarization state since its measurement requires sophisticated instrumentation. Here, the feasibility of its reconstruction of the full-Stokes parameter matrix in the THz band is explored by establishing an all-silicon decoupled metasurface based on the polarization multiplexing encoding technique. The pixelated focal spots gathered in the target plane allow us to employ more elaborate methods to extract the characteristic parameters of the incident polarization states. The resolvability of the THz polarization detection behavior with a single focal spot is further optimized benefiting from the longitudinal polarization component (E-z) generated by the tightly focused beam in the propagation direction. The capability of the E-z-component in determining the key parameters that compose the polarization ellipse is evaluated by predefining the random incident polarization on a standard Poincare sphere. Thus, the proposed scheme offers significant advantages in future THz communications, providing opportunities for ultra-compact, high-resolution full-Stokes polarization imaging and multidimensional information processing.

Relational values of nature in empirical research: A systematic review	PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Review; Early Access						conservation; decision-making; empirical research; environmental management; environmental values; relational values; sustainability	PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SOCIAL VALUES; PLACE; CONSERVATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; MATTERS; AREAS	In the past 5 years, scholarly and policy attention to relational values, a concept that articulates plural values of nature, has grown steadily. To date, there are no published syntheses of empirical research that explicitly addresses relational values. We perform a systematic literature review of n = 72 empirical studies of relational values to summarize the state of current research and to identify opportunities for future research and conceptual development. In our analysis, we categorize what authors identify as relational values and summarize study characteristics (e.g. study location, methods approach). Authors collectively report n = 312 unique relational values. Categories of identity, social cohesion, livelihoods, connection to place/human-nature connection and sacred are most common. Scholarship that explicitly addresses relational values has increased since 2017 and exhibits substantial diversity: in how relational values are conceptualized (or not); in disciplinary associations; in geographical location and in data collection methods. We find that most empirical research on relational values does not justify how its results reflect characteristics that establish the relational values concept as unique from other environmental values concepts. As a result, diverse interpretations of the relational values concept pose the risk of the relational values concept being so broad and inclusive that it becomes meaningless, or at least meaning-light. Policy implications. Understanding why and how nature matters to people is critical to inform effective and just conservation. Relational values can offer nuanced perspectives on the significance associated with people-nature relationships. We argue that empirical relational values research that grounds itself in the concept's 'core' characteristics can foster conceptual coherence and bolster the relevance of research findings to sustainability and conservation science.

The reverse time migration (RTM) method is popular for its high imaging accuracy. However, most of the current tunnel seismic RTM methods assume complete elasticity, ignoring the nature of wave propagation attenuation, resulting in a poor imaging outcome, especially when tunnelling in the shallow subsurface. Thus, it is necessary to study tunnel RTM suitable for attenuating strata. First, considering the frequency of tunnel seismic forward-prospecting is usually higher than that of ground surface seismic exploration, we established a corresponding tunnel viscous media model to enable viscoacoustic forward modelling of seismic wavefield. Then, a simultaneous compensation approach for its amplitude and phase velocity is proposed based on the combination of the real and imaginary parts of the complex modulus. After the compensation of seismic wavefields, the tunnel Q-RTM imaging method in viscoacoustic media is formed, and its effectiveness is verified by numerical examples. Compared with RTM without attenuation compensation, tunnel Q-RTM effectively enhances the imaging energy and has higher positioning accuracy, improving the imaging effect of complex structures (especially at larger distances from the tunnel face). In the end, a detailed case study is presented to demonstrat the potential of the proposed method for field application.

ObjectivesWhile many of the debates center on how selection methods impact decision making, I argue that selection methods may also affect how justices approach opinion writing. MethodsUsing opinion data from 1953 to 2014 in 21 states and opinion data from 1953 to 2019 in five states, this article investigates whether selection methods influence the clarity of the opinions. ResultsThe results show that selection methods do not have a substantive impact on opinion clarity. What does have an effect on opinion clarity is when justices are ideologically distant from their constituents. Opinion clarity increases when nonpartisan justices are ideologically distant from their constituents, indicating that justices may use written opinions to demonstrate support for public opinion on specific issues, even if they do not generally vote in line with public opinion. In contrast, opinions in states that changed from partisan to nonpartisan are less clear, indicating that when a court changes its selection method, opinion authors may purposefully obfuscate their views and rely on their incumbency advantage to hold on to power. ConclusionThe findings suggest that judicial selection methods only influence opinion clarity in certain contexts.

However, a large number of works are related to controlled radical polymerization (CRP) methods and are generally undertaken at elevated temperatures (>50 & DEG;C). Here is the first report on methacrylate-based nanoparticles fabricated by group transfer polymerization-induced self-assembly (GTPISA) in non-polar media (n-heptane). This GTPISA process is achieved at room temperature (RT) using 1-methoxy-1-(trimethylsiloxy)-2-methylprop-1-ene (MTS) and tetrabutylammonium bis-benzoate (TBABB) as initiator and organic catalyst, respectively. Under these conditions, well-defined metal-free and colorless diblock copolymers are produced with efficient crossover from the non-polar stabilizing poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA) block to the non-soluble poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) segment. The resulting PLMA-b-PBzMA block copolymers simultaneously self-assemble into nanostructures of various sizes and morphologies. GTPISA in non-polar solvent proceeds rapidly at RT and avoids the use of sulfur or halogenated compounds or metallic catalysts associated with the implementation of CRP methods, thus expanding the potential of PISA formulations for applications in non-polar environments.

J	Xu, K; Guo, FH; Yan, GF				Xu, Keng; Guo, Fanghong; Yan, Gangfeng			A distributed consensus based algorithm for economic dispatch over time-varying digraphs	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						directed graphs; distributed algorithms; power generation dispatch; smart power grids; time-varying systems	POWER DISPATCH; OPTIMIZATION; CONVERGENCE; COST	In this paper, a consensus based fully distributed optimization algorithm is proposed for solving economic dispatch problem (EDP) in smart grid. Since the incremental cost of all buses reach consensus when the optimal solution is achieved, it is selected as a consensus variable. An additional variable at each bus, called "surplus" is added to record the local power mismatch, which is used as a feedback variable to purse the balance between power supply and demand. Different from most of the existing distributed methods which require the communication network to be balanced, the algorithm uses a row random matrix and a column random matrix to precisely steer all the agents to asymptotically converge to a global optimal solution over a time-varying directed communication network. Due to the use of a fixed step size, the proposed algorithm also outperforms other algorithms in terms of convergence speed. The graph and eigenvalue perturbation theories are employed for the algorithm convergence analysis, and the upper bound of the parameters required for convergence is given theoretically. Finally, the performance and scalability of the proposed distributed algorithm are verified by several case studies conducted on the IEEE 14-bus power system and a 200-node test system.

The 'Partygate' Investigation into former UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson	POLITICAL QUARTERLY			English	Article						Boris Johnson; Covid; lockdown parties; Conservative Party; Privileges Committee		In dramatic and unprecedented circumstances, a former British Prime Minister has been investigated by the House of Commons Privileges Committee for breaking laws set by his own government by socialising and partying whilst the rest of the country toiled during the Covid lockdowns. The lockdown laws were clear, saying we 'must stay at home, protect the NHS, and save lives'. Socialising of any kind was outlawed, with high fines imposed. Yet, for Boris Johnson, it was unclear whether such restrictions applied to his administration. After the submission of evidence from witnesses in Number Ten and testimony from the defendant himself, a ground-breaking verdict that will reverberate around Westminster and the Conservative Party for months and years to come was delivered-namely, that Boris Johnson knowingly misled Parliament on multiple occasions about the social activities and that he should be held in contempt of Parliament. The fallout of this verdict will cause division within the Conservative Party and will remind voters of a lengthy period most would rather forget. This article reviews the circumstances of the committee proceedings, the evidence presented, the outcome and how this impacts negatively upon trust in politics which, prior to these proceedings, was already at a low point.

This section acts as an introductory review of the field.Then, in the following sections, we elaborate on two technological developments in this field where we are active: (i) multi-wire interconnection and (ii) advanced encapsulation.In terms of multi-wire interconnection, this technology offers improved aesthetics, a similar performance and dimensional freedom compared to the traditional tabbing-stringing process, and the experiments show promising results on extended reliability testing, including thermal cycling, damp heat and humidity freeze, as well as high-temperature storage.In terms of advanced encapsulation, we introduce our approach for curved surfaces using a double-membrane laminator and present results on fabricating curved modules, targeting as demonstration examples on the one hand, glass-glass sunroofs, and on the other hand, lighter-weight bonnets for automotive applications.We mix examples targeting building and automotive applications, to illustrate the variety of requirements (colours, curvature, weight, reliability, safety), although this variety within building and vehicle applications is probably as large as between them.

We determined the clinical implications of angio-based coronary functional assessment in evaluation of suboptimal perfusion and further outcomes among STEMI patients after successful PPCI. Methods and resultsIn this study, STEMI patients in the Chinese STEMI PPCI registry trial (NCT04996901) who achieved post-PPCI thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow were retrospectively screened. Post-procedural quantitative flow ratio (QFR), angio-based microvascular resistance (AMR), and coronary flow velocity (CFV) of the infarct-related artery were calculated. QFR and AMR measure epicardial stenosis severity and microvascular resistance, respectively. QFR+ was defined as QFR < 0.90 while QFR- was QFR & GE; 0.90. AMR+ was defined as AMR & GE; 250 mmHg*s/m while AMR- was AMR < 250 mmHg*s/m. The primary outcome was 30-day new-onset HF. The Kaplan-Meier curves were used to establish the associations between QFR, AMR, CFV, and HF incidences. The relationship between CFV and combined QFR and AMR indices was further assessed. Independent predictors were determined using Cox regression analysis. The receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to assess discriminant ability to predict HF. A total of 942 patients (mean age was 57.8 & PLUSMN; 11.7 years and 84.6% were men) were enrolled. Among them, 129 patients had new-onset HF episodes. Patients in the QFR-/AMR- group had a low risk of HF compared with those in the QFR+/AMR+ group (10.5% vs. 27.3%, P = 0.027). A higher CFV & GE; 17.4 cm/s was associated with low HF incidences as compared with CFV < 17.4 cm/s (10.3% vs. 16.8%, P = 0.005), whereas isolated QFR or AMR did not reveal any marked differences in HF incidences (P = 0.150 and 0.079, respectively). The highest and lowest medians of CFV were observed in the QFR-/AMR- and QFR+/AMR+ groups, respectively. CFV correlated well with the QFR/AMR ratio (adjusted R-2 = 1, P < 0.001) and post-PPCI CFV was found to be an independent predictor of post-STEMI HF (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.90, P = 0.012). The area under curve estimate of the multivariable regression model was 0.749. ConclusionsCFV is an integrated coronary physiological assessment approach that incorporates epicardial and microcirculatory contributions. Patients with post-PPCI CFV < 17.4 cm/s were strongly associated with a high risk for post-STEMI HF, even achieving thrombolysis in myocardial infarction grade 3 flow. The immediate angio-based coronary functional assessment is a feasible tool for evaluating suboptimal perfusion and risk stratification.

The moral deliberation pathway in veterinary practice: a qualitative study	VETERINARY RECORD			English	Article; Early Access							CRITICAL-CARE NURSES; ETHICAL DILEMMAS; DISTRESS	BackgroundVeterinarians may face various ethical decisions and potential moral conflicts in clinical practice. The ethical decision-making process often leads to a satisfying resolution. However, when such a process is accompanied by a perceived inability to act according to a person's values, it can lead to psychological distress that characterises moral distress. Theoretical models in professions such as nursing attempt to explain the evolution of moral conflict into moral distress. In veterinary professionals, a model has been proposed to explain this pathway (the moral deliberation pathway). However, empirical data are still lacking on whether veterinary clinicians experience a moral deliberation pathway as hypothesised. MethodsUsing thematic analysis, this qualitative study investigates veterinary clinicians' experiences with moral distress and aims to explain the moral deliberation pathway in these veterinarians. ResultsThe results suggest that veterinarians' experiences with moral distress follow a deliberation process that can be explained by the proposed moral deliberation pathway. Experiencing a moral conflict leads to moral stress, then either to moral distress or resolution into moral comfort. LimitationsSelf-selection of participants and possible recollection bias may have biased the findings. ConclusionsThe empirical data provided by this study can inform future research and intervention strategies to identify, measure and manage moral distress in the veterinary context.

However, uncontrollable dendritic growth in the K-metal anode and chemical reactivity of the layered transition metal oxide cathode against the electrolyte solution cause KMBs to suffer from low Coulombic efficiency, rapid capacity fading, and critical safety issues. In this study, an electrolyte engineering strategy is introduced by introducing adiponitrile (ADN) as a dual-functional electrolyte additive containing an electron-rich nitrile group (C & EQUIV;N) in its molecule structure. Thus, the addition of 1 wt.% ADN can alter the chemical properties of the electrolyte solution, thereby improving the anode-electrolyte and cathode-electrolyte interfacial stabilities in KMBs. The formation of a potassiophilic compound with C & EQUIV;N in the solid electrolyte interphase layer can guide the uniform electrodeposition of K and suppress the dendritic growth in the K-metal. Moreover, C & EQUIV;N forms a strong coordination bond with the oxidized transition metal, leading the reversible redox reactions by mitigating the undesirable disproportionation reaction and improving the thermal stability of the layered transition metal oxide cathode. Computational calculations and experimental characterizations are used to verify the role of ADN additive in enhancing the electrochemical properties of KMBs.

In this article we focus on the ways in which cultural historic activity theory (CHAT) and its analytical activity systems can be used to reveal creative processes in context. We draw on the tools and concepts of CHAT and data from a study of visual communication design (VCD) students and lecturers situated within a transnational higher education (TNHE) context at a university in China. An analytical framework was constructed to research practices used in creative design process learning. The dynamic nature of CHAT offers design process research methods a set of analytical tools to capture the powerful parts played by artifacts and interactions within specific sociocultural and historic learning contexts.

Study DesignA retrospective cohort study was conducted on neonates born <30 weeks gestation and weighing <1250 g, comparing those who received carnitine supplementation to those without supplementation. Free carnitine and total acylcarnitine data were collected from routine newborn screens in the first days of life and on full enetral feeds. Univariate analysis was performed, and those factors that were significantly different between the two groups were adjusted for using mixed effects analysis. ResultsThere were 108 supplemented and 45 unsupplemented neonates in the study. At baseline, free carnitine (19.8 & PLUSMN; 3.3 vs 18.9 & PLUSMN; 3.7 & mu;mol/L, P = 0.53) and total acylcarnitine (26.6 & PLUSMN; 5.1 vs 22.5 & PLUSMN; 7.1 & mu;mol/L, P = 0.11) were similar between the two groups. At full enteral feeds, compared with unsupplemented group, supplemented infants had significantly higher free carnitine (27.1 & PLUSMN; 16.4 vs 17.1 & PLUSMN; 8.5 & mu;mol/L, P < 0.001) and total acylcarnitine (30.3 & PLUSMN; 11.5 vs 20.2 & PLUSMN; 10.1 & mu;mol/L, P < 0.001). None of the supplemented neonates developed biochemical carnitine deficiency as compared with 18% in the unsupplemented group (P < 0.001). No difference was observed in time to reach full lipid provision, and there were no differences in the change in the triglyceride levels from baseline to the time on full PN lipid provision (P = 0.39). ConclusionPreterm neonates routinely supplemented with parenteral carnitine at 5 mg/kg/day demonstrated higher free carnitine and total acylcarnitine levels at full feeds, with none developing biochemical carnitine deficiency.

Selection of parents in a population hybrid breeding scheme for sweetpotato in Uganda	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						desired genetic gains; heterosis; hybrids; Pesek-Baker index; sweetpotato	VARIANCE COMPONENT ESTIMATIONS; VIRUS; RESISTANCE; TRIALS	Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam. [2n = 6x = 90]) is a highly heterozygous, clonally propagated crop for which population hybrid breeding is expected to result in yield jumps and large genetic gain increases. The main objective of this study was to select parents for a heterosis exploiting breeding scheme in Uganda using general combining ability and index selection aggregating yield and biotic stress traits. Two large and very diverse breeding populations established in Uganda (UGA A, 50 parents; UGA B, 80 parents) were recombined for this study into a hybrid population comprising 8097 genotypes from 1097 interpopulation families. Parents and offspring clones were evaluated in unreplicated trials across five environments during 2018/2019, together with two commercial checks (Ejumula and NASPOT 8). Using mixed model analysis, breeding values (BVs) were estimated across traits (i.e., storage root yield, commercial roots per plant, foliage yield, and resistance to sweetpotato virus disease [SPVD] and Alternaria blight). For storage root yield, the BVs ranged from 3.5 to 10 t ha(-1) and from 2 to 12 t ha(-1) for parents in UGA A and B, respectively. For SPVD resistance, scored one month before harvest, the BVs ranged from 3.3 to 4.3 and from 3.1 to 4.7 for parents in UGA A and B, respectively. Out of 130 parental candidates, 40 parents were selected (20 for each parental group). The plan is to use in the future GCA values combined by a modified Pesek-Baker index using standardized desired genetic gains to select parents together with other information such as flesh color of parental material.

J	You, Y; Li, M; Xie, AA; Wang, WM				You, You; Li, Man; Xie, Ana; Wang, Weimin			First-round accreditation and pass rates on licensing examination at different medical schools in China: Closing the performance gap	MEDICAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access							EDUCATION ACCREDITATION; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; OUTCOMES; IMPACT	BackgroundAlthough the accreditation approach is widely used to ensure the quality of medical education in many countries, there is scant empirical evidence on whether and how it improves actual medical school performance. We focused on conditions in China, which introduced an accreditation system during the 2010s. Specifically, we examined the relationship between first-round accreditation and actual performance based on the results of medical licensing examinations. Referring to organisation theory, we hypothesised that the impacts of accreditation would depend on existing performance gaps. MethodIn 2022, we analysed panel data from 105 Chinese medical schools during accreditation (2012 to 2021) and pass rates on medical licensing examinations (2011 to 2019), as matched into 834 school-year records in a window of years before and after accreditation. We employed fixed-effects regression models with a comparison group to exclude factors that may have confounded the impacts of accreditation time. We also demonstrated the heterogeneous effects of accreditation by tier and performance gap of medical schools. ResultsThe conservative estimates showed a substantial cumulative improvement (over 15 percentage points) in pass rates during the years before accreditation, with no clear trend indicating performance drops in the years after accreditation. Lower-tiered medical schools gained greater benefits from accreditation. Medical schools with a larger prior performance gap achieved a greater percentage point increase in pass rates with the passage of time in pre-accreditation years. ConclusionsThis is the first empirical study to investigate whether accreditation has bridged performance gaps among medical schools. The results support the value of accreditation in China, a country that recently established the system, and might work as a substitute for missing information on early accreditation history in countries with long-established accreditation systems. We encourage more studies in countries that have recently introduced accreditation systems.

Using three national surveys, we randomly present information about a hypothetical legislator's voting record, committee assignment, and district-oriented work. After evaluating the legislator, respondents are presented with information about a challenger running on a nationalized message. Respondents, especially out-partisans, report much greater satisfaction with the legislator when told about his district-oriented activities, but increased willingness to vote for the legislator is more limited and mostly reserved for independents. In varying information about the legislator's voting record, we also find scant evidence that bipartisan legislators are better at securing a personal vote. In two experimental extensions, we show that our findings generalize to evaluations of real senators, and that nationalizing elections is one possible way that opponents can thwart incumbent efforts at winning the votes of independents and out-partisans through traditional district-oriented appeals.

Microanalytical approaches based on laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) often suffer from effects induced by the sample matrix. In this study, we investigate matrix-independent analyses of B isotopic ratios and apply this technique to cold-water corals. MethodsWe employ a customized 193 nm femtosecond laser ablation system (Solstice, Spectra-Physics) coupled to a MC-ICP-MS system (Nu Plasma II, Nu Instruments) equipped with electron multipliers for in situ measurements of B isotopic ratios (B-11/B-10) at the micrometric scale. We analyzed various reference materials of silicate and carbonate matrices using non-matrix matched calibration without employing any correction. This approach was then applied to investigate defined increments in coral samples from a Chilean fjord. ResultsWe obtained accurate B isotopic ratios with a reproducibility of +/- 0.9 parts per thousand (2 SD) for various reference materials including silicate glasses (GOR132-G, StHs6/80-G, ATHO-G and NIST SRM 612), clay (IAEA-B-8) and carbonate (JCp-1) using the silicate glass NIST SRM 610 as calibration standard, which shows that neither laser-induced nor ICP-related matrix effects are detectable. The application to cold-water corals (Desmophyllum dianthus) reveals minor intra-skeleton variations in delta B-11 with average values between 23.01 parts per thousand and 25.86 parts per thousand. ConclusionsOur instrumental set-up provides accurate and precise B isotopic ratios independently of the sample matrix at the micrometric scale. This approach opens a wide field of application in geochemistry, including pH reconstruction in biogenic carbonates and deciphering processes related to fluid-mineral interaction.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of existing CABI-based PVs is still seriously constrained by the presence of both intrinsic and surface defects. Herein, antimony (III) (Sb3+) is introduced into the octahedral lattice sites of the CABI structure, leading to CABI-Sb with larger crystalline domains than CABI. The alloying of Sb3+ with bismuth (III) (Bi3+) induces changes in the local structural symmetry that dramatically increase the formation energy of intrinsic defects. Light-intensity dependence and electron impedance spectroscopic studies show reduced trap-assisted recombination in the CABI-Sb PV devices. CABI-Sb solar cells feature a nearly 40% PCE enhancement (from 1.31% to 1.82%) with respect to the CABI devices mainly due to improvement in short-circuit current density. This work will promote future compositional design studies to enhance the intrinsic defect tolerance of next-generation wide-bandgap absorbers for high-performance and stable PVs.

However, this sex bias in oral autoimmune diseases has been classically reported from an epidemiological perspective without any elaborate attempts to unveil the underlying mechanisms. The unique nature of the oral environment is likely to impose a combination of systemic and local factors that ultimately result in the sex bias in autoimmune diseases of the oral cavity. Variations of immune responses, target organ vulnerability, endocrine and genetic factors, sex chromosomes and modes of parental inheritance are potential systemic factors, while the oral microbiome, oral tolerance, saliva, and oral epithelial stem cells may account for local contributing factors. This review will discuss the preponderance of women in oral immune-mediated diseases, the potential systemic and local mechanisms underlying this predominance and highlight the crucial need for further research in this area.

Data-driven stability of stochastic mean-field type games via noncooperative neural network adversarial training	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article; Early Access						adversarial training; data-driven differential games; neural networks; robustness; stochastic mean-field type games; stochastic stability; supervised machine learning	MAXIMUM PRINCIPLE	We propose an approach to neural network stochastic differential games of mean-field type and its corresponding stochastic stability analysis by means of adversarial training (aka adversarial attacks). This is a class of data-driven differential games where the distribution of the variables such as the system states and the decision-makers' strategies (control inputs) is incorporated into the problem. This work casts the cooperative/noncooperative game terminology into the deep learning framework where we talk about cooperative and noncooperative neural network computations that involve learning capabilities and neural network architectures. We suggest a method to computationally validate the feasibility of the approximated solutions via neural networks and evaluate the stochastic stability of the associated closed-loop system (state feedback Nash). Moreover, we enhance the stochastic stability by enlarging the training set with adversarial initial states to obtain a more robust neural network for a particular decision-maker. Finally, a worked-out example based on the linear-quadratic mean-field type game (LQ-MTG) that illustrates our methodology is presented.

Measuring chemical exchange saturation transfer exchange rates in the human brain using a particle swarm optimisation algorithm	NMR IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						amides; amines; CEST; magnetisation transfer; NOE; z-spectrum	MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER; TRANSFER CEST; Z-SPECTRUM; IN-VIVO; RELAXATION; CREATINE; SIGNAL; MRI; MT	The z-spectrum contains many pools with different exchange rates and T-2 values, which can make it difficult to interpret in vivo data and complicates the design of experiments aimed at providing sensitivity to one pool. This work aims to characterise the main pools observable with MRI at 7T in the human brain. To achieve this, we acquired z-spectra at multiple saturation powers in the human brain at 7T. We used simulations to optimise the use of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to fit these data, validating this approach using further simulations and creatine phantoms. We then used the PSO to fit data from grey and white matter for the pool size, exchange rate, and T-2 of five proton pools (magnetisation transfer, amides, amines, nuclear Overhauser enhancement NOE-3.5ppm and NOE-1.7ppm in addition to water). We then devised an approach for using PSO to fit z-spectra while limiting the computational burden, and we investigated the sensitivity of the fit to T-2 and k for three overlapping pools. We used this to measure the exchange rate of creatine and to show that it varied with temperature, as expected. In the brain we measured a significantly larger pool size in white matter than in grey matter for the magnetisation transfer pool and the NOE-3.5ppm pool. For all other parameters we found no significant difference between grey and white matter. We showed that PSO can be used to fit z-spectra acquired at a range of B-1 to provide information about peak position, amplitude, exchange rate, and T-2 in vivo in the human brain. These data could provide more sensitivity to change in some clinical conditions and will also provide key information for further experimental design.	[Carradus, Andrew J.; Bradley, Joe M.

The obtained equilibrium structure and mechanical properties are in good agreement with other theoretical results. First, the phonon dispersion spectra at zero pressure and high pressure are calculated. The results show that c-BAs is dynamically stable under pressure of 0-110 GPa. Second, the lattice constants, elastic constants, Young's modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, B/G, sound velocity, and Debye temperature of c-BAs under zero pressure and high pressure are calculated. c-BAs are predicted to be unstable above 112.3 GPa in accordance with the elastic stability criterion. Furthermore, it is indicated by the calculated B/G ratio that c-BAs is brittle at zero GPa and begins to tend to be ductile as pressure rises to 46.4 GPa. The calculated elastic anisotropy coefficients indicate that c-BAs has elastic anisotropy. The thermodynamic properties of c-BAs are investigated at high temperatures and pressures by combining generalized density function theory and the quasiharmonic Debye model. It is suggested by the calculated elastic and thermodynamic properties that c-BAs can be used as candidate structures for the fabrication of efficient solar cells and thermoelectric materials.

The 90% percentile RIs (n = 156, mean bodyweight 41.8 g) are as follows: glucose (GLU) 2.4-11.3 mmol/L, haematocrit (Hct) 18.9%-39.2%, haemoglobin concentration (Hb) 56.0-85.0 g/L, total plasma protein (TPP) 56.0-77.0 g/L, total red blood cell (RBC) count 4.1-11.2 x 10(12)/L, total white blood cell (WBC) count 5.3-69.9 x 10(9)/L, total lymphocytes 4.7-51.4 x 10(9)/L, monocytes 0.3-16.2 x 10(9)/L and heterophils count 0.6-8.4 x 10(9)/L. Pearson's method analysis showed weak but significantly positive correlations between fish bodyweight and Hct, Hb, TPP and total RBC count (p < 0.05). Histopathology of 42 of the 156 clinically healthy fish used to derive the RIs, with blood values within the 90% percentile range, did not exhibit any abnormal pathology. In contrast, histopathology from a different group of clinically healthy L. calcarifer (n = 72, mean bodyweight 31.3 g) with blood values falling outside of these established 90% percentile RIs showed that 25% of these fish had severe, chronic granulomatous enteritis, and 13% had severely depleted lipid stores in their liver. Point biserial correlation analysis of blood values from this second group of 72 fish showed that elevated total WBC, monocyte and heterophil counts and reduced Hct levels are significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the occurrence of severe, chronic granulomatous enteritis and depleted lipid stores in their liver. Reduced blood GLU and TPP levels in the second group of fish were significantly associated with fish that had depleted lipid stores in liver (p < 0.05), corroborating a period of malnutrition. This study is among the first to establish blood RIs for clinically healthy, farmed juvenile L. calcarifer and detection of subclinical diseases in fish to support early intervention.

Various surface assessment methods were employed, and the efficiency of the membrane performance was demonstrated through the flux and the retention of the filtration process, which used calcium chloride as the foulant. Antibacterial, antifouling, and anti-biofouling capabilities were assessed through several tests. The findings revealed that the chitosan/silver nanoparticles-grafted membranes exhibited superior antibacterial and anti-biofouling abilities with consistent flux and enhanced retention, underscoring the prospective implementation of this approach in filtration systems to curtail biofouling and bolster overall efficacy.

Shaping the effective exploitation strategy for this valuable species requires detailed knowledge of its biology, including feeding and digestion processes, especially near the natural limits of the species range. Meanwhile, the digestion physiology of the European catfish remains poorly explored, including the activity of major digestive enzymes and the possible effect of intestinal parasites on this activity. In this regard, the activity of proteinases and a-amylase in the intestinal mucosa of the catfish was studied. Adult catfish were collected in the Rybinsk reservoir (Upper Volga) located close to the northern limit of the species range. It was shown that all subclasses of intestinal digestive proteinases, including serine proteinases, metalloproteases and cysteine (thiol) proteinases, function in the gut mucosa of the catfish. The mucosal levels of total proteolytic activity depended on fish size, in contrast to those of trypsin, chymotrypsin and a-amylase. The level of chymotrypsin activity was significantly higher than that of trypsin activity. It was also found that the incubation medium and extract of the cestodes Silurotaenia siluri parasitizing the catfish gut had a significant inhibitory effect on the activity of serine proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) operating in the intestines of the host fish.

Age-Associated Changes in Knee Osteoarthritis, Pain-Related Behaviors, and Dorsal Root Ganglia Immunophenotyping of Male and Female Mice	ARTHRITIS & RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							GENE-EXPRESSION; CARTILAGE; MECHANISMS; CCL2	Objective Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of chronic pain, yet OA pain management remains poor. Age is the strongest predictor of OA development, and mechanisms driving OA pain are unclear. We undertook this study to characterize age-associated changes in knee OA, pain-related behaviors, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) molecular phenotypes in mice of both sexes.Methods Male or female C57BL/6 mice 6 or 20 months of age were evaluated for histopathologic knee OA, pain-related behaviors, and L3-L5 DRG immune characterization via flow cytometry. DRG gene expression in older mice and humans was also examined.Results Male mice at 20 months of age had worse cartilage degeneration than 6-month-old mice. Older female mouse knees showed increased cartilage degeneration but to a lesser degree than those of male mice. Older mice of both sexes had worse mechanical allodynia, knee hyperalgesia, and grip strength compared to younger mice. For both sexes, DRGs from older mice showed decreased CD45+ cells and a significant increase in F4/80+ macrophages and CD11c+ dendritic cells. Older male mouse DRGs showed increased expression of Ccl2 and Ccl5, and older female mouse DRGs showed increased Cxcr4 and Ccl3 expression compared to 6-month-old mouse DRGs, among other differentially expressed genes. Human DRG analysis from 6 individuals >80 years of age revealed elevated CCL2 in men compared to women, whereas CCL3 was higher in DRGs from women.Conclusion We found that aging in male and female mice is accompanied by mild knee OA, mechanical sensitization, and changes to immune cell populations in the DRG, suggesting novel avenues for development of OA therapies.

The modeling framework allows for the use of driver booking fees and penalties for unmatched drivers, therefore supporting different system operating modes. We model this problem as a two-stage stochastic set packing problem. To tackle the intractability of the stochastic problem, we introduce three model approximations and evaluate them on a large set of benchmark instances for three different system operating modes. Our computational experiments show the superiority of some model approximations over others and provide valuable insights on the impact of penalties and booking fees on the system's profitability and user satisfaction.

Recently, for many solid tumors (including breast cancer) metabolic reprogramming has appeared as a cancer cell hallmark, and the elevated glycolytic pathway has been linked to their aggressive phenotype. In the present study, we evaluated the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2- kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) in TNBCs. Prognostic significance of PFKFB3 expression was evaluated in overall breast cancers as well as in TNBCs. PFKFB3 inhibitor (3PO potent analogue i.e., PFK15) cytotoxicity in TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) was analyzed using an MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Cancer cell physiological characteristics like clonogenicity and migration were also investigated after PFK15 treatment. As fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), has been associated with increased PFK-1 activity, the effect of PFKFB3 inhibition by PFK15 was investigated on two major isoforms of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) in breast cancer, that is, phosphofructokinase-platelet type (PFKP) and phosphofructokinase-liver type (PFKL) (relevant to breast cancer). For PFKL inhibition, the siRNA approach was used. PFKFB3 expression was significantly correlated with inferior overall survival in breast cancer patients including TNBCs. PFK15 treatment in TNBC cells (i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) resulted in a decreased PFKP expression, thereby leading to reduced colony formation ability, migration rate, and extracellular lactate levels. However, to our surprise PFK15 treatment in both TNBC cells also resulted in elevated PFKL levels. Our results demonstrated that the combinatorial inhibition of PFK15 with siPFKL was more effective in TNBC cells, as it led to a decrease in colony formation ability, migration rate, extracellular lactate levels, and PFK-1 activity when compared with individual treatments. Using bona fide PFKFB3 inhibitor, that is, AZ67, we further show that AZ67 treatment to TNBC cells has no effect either on the expression of PFKP and PFKL, or on the lactate production. In summary, our present in vitro study demonstrated that 3PO derived PFK15 mechanism of action is totally different from AZ67 in TNBC cells. However, we advocate that the PFK15-mediated inhibition (along with PFKL) on the TNBCs migration, colony formation, and PFK-1 activity can be further explored for the therapeutic advantage of TNBC patients.

Real-Time, In Situ Imaging of Macrophages via Phase-Change Peptide Nanoemulsions	SMALL			English	Article; Early Access						fluorine; macrophage; peptide; self-assembly; ultrasound	INFLAMMATION; CELLS	Macrophages are specialized phagocytes that play central roles in immunity and tissue repair. Their diverse functionalities have led to an evolution of new allogenic and autologous macrophage products. However, realizing the full therapeutic potential of these cell-based therapies requires development of imaging technologies that can track immune cell migration within tissues in real-time. Such innovations will not only inform treatment regimens and empower interpretation of therapeutic outcomes but also enable prediction and early intervention during adverse events. Here, phase-changing nanoemulsion contrast agents are reported that permit real-time, continuous, and high-fidelity ultrasound imaging of macrophages in situ. Using a de novo designed peptide emulsifier, liquid perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions are prepared and show that rational control over interfacial peptide assembly affords formulations with tunable acoustic sensitivity, macrophage internalization, and in cellulo stability. Imaging experiments demonstrate that emulsion-loaded macrophages can be readily visualized using standard diagnostic B-mode and Doppler ultrasound modalities. This allows on-demand and long-term tracking of macrophages within porcine coronary arteries, as an exemplary model. The results demonstrate that this platform is poised to open new opportunities for non-invasive, contrast-enhanced imaging of cell-based immunotherapies in tissues, while leveraging the low-cost, portable, and safe nature of diagnostic ultrasound.

Moreover, chalcogens and halides are desirable in scientific research when forming layers or membranes. The Janus monolayer is unique two-faced material composed of two different chemical species on opposite sides of a single layer. Herein, we use first-principles simulations to thoroughly investigate the electrical and optical properties of this material. Our calculations reveal that the Bromochlorohafnium (HfClBr) Janus monolayer is an indirect semiconductor at equilibrium, with an energy gap of 0.928 eV and changing from 0.532 eV to 1.233 eV after applying the biaxial strain, as determined by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) method. The results indicate that the Janus HfClBr monolayer has a competitive advantage over other materials for use in solar cells and energy storage devices due to its unique optical and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, our analysis showed that the optical and electrical characteristics of the Janus HfClBr monolayer are significantly impacted by biaxial strain, with the ability to absorb light in both the visible and ultraviolet spectral regions. Additionally, the first optical gap of the Janus HfClBr monolayer is found to be shiftable under the biaxial strain, suggesting potential applications in nano-electronics, particularly in the field of solar cells.

The receptor performs contrasting functions in central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues. Although the receptor is neurotoxic and proapoptotic in CNS, it has also been reported to act in an antiapoptotic manner by modulating cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and migration in different types of cancers. The receptor mediates its neurotoxic effects by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels, leading to the activation of its downstream target, protein kinase C, in different neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and epilepsy. Antagonists ONO-8713, SC51089, and SC51322 against EP1 receptor ameliorate the neurotoxic effect by attenuating the neuroinflammation. The receptor also shows increased expression in different types of cancers and has been found to activate different signaling pathways, which lead to the development, progression, and metastasis of different cancers. The receptor stimulates the cell survival pathway by phosphorylating the AKT and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) signaling pathways. Although there are limited studies about this receptor and not a single clinical trial has been targeting the EP1 receptor for different neurological disorders or cancer, the receptor is appearing as a potential candidate for therapeutic targets. The aim of this article is to review the recent progress in understanding the pathogenic roles of EP1 receptors in different pathological conditions.

Numerous studies have suggested that nanopesticides could soon fully replace conventional pesticides since they are far more effective than those now in use. Due to an increase in their surface-to-volume ratio, nanomaterials exhibit different properties from their bulk counterparts. Nanopesticides are pesticides that have been made with these nanoparticles and have a high application efficiency and significantly fewer hazardous environmental impacts than pesticides that have been made chemically. Various formulation strategies, which include the containment of the active substance by the nanoparticles, have previously been established, exhibiting promising effects on the pests. Target specificity, high stability, and controlled active ingredients (AIs) release are a few of the noteworthy qualities these nanopesticides offer. The development of green nanopesticides derived from nature, which have very low ecotoxicities and nanoscale qualities, can also have a significant positive impact on crop output. However, before being mass-produced and used, the discovery still has to be thoroughly examined to determine its effects on people and the environment due to the lack of conclusive proof demonstrating its toxicity. This paper aims to represent the use of nanopesticides in crop protection and a detailed overview of the various methods for the formulation of nanopesticides. Also, the possible negative impacts on the non-target species by the application of nanopesticides have been briefly discussed. The need for the development of green nanopesticides to avoid the negative aspects of nanopesticides has also been highlighted.

DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY			English	Article								Background and Aims. To control the COVID-19 spread, in March 2020, a forced home lockdown was established in Spain. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effect of mobility and social COVID-19-established restrictions on depressive symptomatology in older adults with metabolic syndrome. We hypothesize that severe restrictions might have resulted in detrimental changes in depressive symptomatology. Methods. 2,312 PREDIMED-Plus study participants (men = 53:9%; mean age = 64:9 +/- 4:8 years) who completed a COVID-19 lockdown questionnaire to assess the severity of restrictions/lockdown and the validated Spanish version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) during the three established phases concerning the COVID-19 lockdown in Spain (prelockdown, lockdown, and postlockdown) were included in this longitudinal analysis. Participants were categorized according to high or low lockdown severity. Analyses of covariance were performed to assess changes in depressive symptomatology across lockdown phases. Results. No significant differences in participant depression symptomatology changes were observed between lockdown severity categories (low/high) at the studied phases. During the lockdown phase, participants showed a decrease in BDI-II score compared to the prelockdown phase (mean (95% CI), -0.48 (-0.24, -0.72), P < 0:001); a nonsignificantly larger decrease was observed in participants allocated in the low-lockdown category (low: -0.59 (-0.95, -0.23), high: -0.43 (-0.67, -0.19)). Similar decreases in depression symptomatology were found for the physical environment dimension. The post- and prelockdown phase BDI-II scores were roughly similar. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown was associated with a decrease in depressive symptomatology that returned to prelockdown levels after the lockdown. The degree of lockdown was not associated with depressive symptomatology. The potential preventive role of the physical environment and social interactions on mental disorders during forced home lockdown should be further studied. This trial is registered with ISRCTN89898870. Retrospectively registered on 24 July 2014.

More recently, the use of this mechanism to regulate gene expression in heterospecific partners - cross-kingdom RNAi (ckRNAi) - has been shown to form a critical part of bidirectional interactions between hosts and endosymbionts, regulating the interplay between microbial infection mechanisms and host immunity. Here, we review the current understanding of ckRNAi as it relates to interactions between plants and their pathogenic and mutualistic endosymbionts, with particular emphasis on evidence in support of ckRNAi in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis.

Simultaneous wireless information and power transmission-based power transfer and energy prediction for efficient communication with golden Taylor sea lion optimization in wireless sensor network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO); Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN); Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO); Taylor series; Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)	ROUTING PROTOCOL; CLUSTERING PROTOCOL; SECURE; ALGORITHM	Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an emerging lower cost and resourceful solution, which enables controlled observation of the environment. The high amount of energy is required in wireless networks during the transmission of data. Here, Golden Ant Lion Whale Optimization (GALWO) and Golden Taylor Sea Lion Optimization (GTSLnO) techniques are presented for cluster head (CH) selection and prediction of neighbor nodes' age. The six stages performed in this work are setup, steady-state, prediction, power transfer, communication or route discovery, and route maintenance stages. In the setup level, CH selection is carried out by GALWO, which is the combination of Ant Lion Whale Optimization (ALWO) with Golden Search Optimization (GSO). Moreover, ALWO is an integration of Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). In the steady state, the distance, energy, delay, throughput, and trust update are considered as objective functions. In the prediction stage, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) is utilized for age prediction of neighbor nodes, wherein Deep CNN is tuned by employing GTSLnO. The GTSLnO is an incorporation of GSO and Taylor series with Sea Lion Optimization (SLnO). Then, the power transfer stage is done utilizing simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT). Thereafter, the communication/route discovery stage is conducted for path selection through neighbor node, and lastly, the route maintenance stage is carried out. The GTSLnO-Deep CNN achieved a minimal delay of 0.089 s, maximal residual energy, throughput, and trust of 0.500 J, 98,843 kbps, and 0.452 for DoS attack.

Degradable, Ultraviolet-Crosslinked Pressure-Sensitive Adhesives Made from Thioester-Functional Acrylate Copolymers	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article; Early Access						Degradable Polymers; Polymers; Radical Ring-Opening Polymerization; Recycling	PERFORMANCE	Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are made from soft, irreversibly lightly crosslinked polymers. Even after removal from surfaces, they retain insoluble networks which pose problems during the recycling of glass and cardboard. Herein, degradable PSAs are presented that provide the required performance in use but have networks that can be degraded after use. A series of copolymers was prepared through radical copolymerization of n-butyl acrylate, 4-acryloyloxy benzophenone (ABP) photo-crosslinker, and dibenzo[c,e]oxepin-5(7H)-thione (DOT) to provide degradable backbone thioesters. The optimum tack and peel strengths were found for molar contents of 0.05 mol% ABP and 0.25 mol% DOT. Degradation of the backbone thioesters through aminolysis or thiolysis led to the full dissolution of the networks, loss of adhesive properties of films (decreases in the measured tack and peel strengths), and the quick detachment of model labels from a substrate. Inclusion of DOT into PSAs offers a viable route toward degradable and recyclable packaging labels.

Applying growth factors with neurotrophic roles is beneficial for accelerating peripheral nerve regeneration. Here we show that after rat sciatic nerve injury, growth factor amphiregulin (AREG) is upregulated in Schwann cells of sciatic nerves. Elevated AREG stimulates the proliferation and migration of Schwann cells by activating ERK1/2 cascade. Schwann cell-secreted AREG further facilitates the outgrowth of neurites and the elongation of injured axons. Administration of AREG to injured sciatic nerves stimulates the proliferation of Schwann cells to replace lost cell population, encourages the migration of Schwann cells to form cell cords, and facilitates the regrowth of axons. Overall, our results identify AREG as an important neurotrophic factor and thus provide a promising therapeutic avenue towards peripheral nerve injury.

To investigate whether driver mutations are involved in the background of PD-L1 expression, the EGFR major activating mutation was selected as the most frequent driver mutation. Surgical resection specimens were used to extract sufficient amounts of nucleic acids for analysis, and the high tumor proportion score (TPS:100%) and low (TPS: 0%) PD-L1-expressing parts of the tumor were each laser microdissected to examine the association between PD-L1 expression heterogeneity and genetic mutations within the same tumor. The association between PD-L1 heterogeneity and gene mutations within the same tumor was investigated. Analysis showed no association between PD-L1 expression heterogeneity and genetic variants, which were found to be almost identical. However, PD-L1 expression was found to be associated with the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) present in the tumor, which may be related to whether or not lymphocytes can infiltrate into the tumor depending on the tumor histological type (solid pattern, lepidic pattern, etc.) and other factors.

This study aimed to explore the roles of T cells in chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) using single-cell RNA sequencing and to further investigate Granzyme A (GZMA) in angiogenesis regulation. MethodologyA total of five CAP samples were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing. We performed subcluster and lineage-tracing analyses for T cells. According to differential gene expression, distinct biological functions enriched in T cells of CAP were presented by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and compared with healthy gingiva (data obtained from the GEO database). CellChat was used to explore potential ligand-receptor interactions between T cells and endothelial cells in CAP. The coculture of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and Jurkat T cells, as well as the addition of GZMA recombinant protein, was used to validate the predicted pair of GZMA and coagulation factor II thrombin receptor (F2R) by RT-PCR, angiogenesis and migration assays. ResultsA transcriptomic atlas of 44 746 individual cells was constructed from the periapical lesions of five patients with CAP by single-cell RNA-seq, and eight cell types were identified. We identified nine subsets of T cells and deciphered the cellular heterogeneity of T cells in CAP at the functional level by subclustering and GSEA. Lineage tracing revealed a distinct lineage of T cells in CAP and predicted the transition of the T cellular state upon CAP. GSEA revealed multiple biological processes and relevant angiogenesis genes upregulated in CAP T cells. GZMA-F2R pairs were predicted by cell-cell interactions in CAP. High expression of GZMA and F2R was observed in the coculture of HUVECs and Jurkat T cells, and the proangiogenic capacity of the GZMA recombinant protein was emphasized by in vitro experiments. ConclusionsOur study provides novel insights into the heterogeneity of T cells in periapical lesions and reveals the potential role of GZMA in T cells in regulating angiogenesis in HUVECs.

While the processes that drive proliferation and outgrowth of the limb mesenchyme are well established, the fundamental mechanisms that precede this process and initiate EMT are less understood. In this review, we outline putative drivers of EMT of the LPM, drawing from analyses across a range of vertebrates and developmental models. We detail the expression patterns of key EMT transcriptional regulators in the somatic LPM of the presumptive limb fields, and their potential role in producing a mesenchymal cell fate. These include a putative cooperative role between the EMT inducers PRRX1 and TWIST1, supported by evidence in zebrafish and chicken models but unconfirmed data from mice. As such, additional functional data are required to definitively determine the mechanisms that initiate and drive EMT of the somatic LPM, a critical transition preceding formation of the limb bud mesenchyme.

A target site mutation H258Y was recently discovered in a resistant strain of the spider mite pest Tetranychus urticae. H258Y causes strong cross-resistance between cyenopyrafen and pyflubumide, but not cyflumetofen. In fungal pests, fitness costs associated with substitutions at the corresponding H258 position that confer resistance to fungicidal SDH inhibitors have not been uncovered. Here, we used H258 and Y258 near-isogenic lines of T. urticae to quantify potential pleiotropic fitness effects on mite physiology. RESULTSThe H258Y mutation was not associated with consistent significant changes of single generation life history traits and fertility life table parameters. In contrast, proportional Sanger sequencing and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction showed that the frequency of the resistant Y258 allele decreased when replicated 50:50 Y258:H258 experimentally evolving populations were maintained in an acaricide-free environment for approximately 12 generations. Using in vitro assays with mitochondrial extracts from resistant (Y258) and susceptible (H258) lines, we identified a significantly reduced SDH activity (48% lower activity) and a slightly enhanced combined complex I and III activity (18% higher activity) in the Y258 lines. CONCLUSIONOur findings suggest that the H258Y mutation is associated with a high fitness cost in the spider mite T. urticae. Importantly, while it is the most common approach, it is clear that only comparing life history traits and life table fecundity does not allow to reliably estimate fitness costs of target site mutations in natural pest populations. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Duodichogamy is a rare flowering system in which individual plants flower in the sequence male-female-male. We studied the adaptive advantages of this flowering system using chestnuts (Castanea spp., Fagaceae) as models. These insect-pollinated trees produce many unisexual male catkins responsible for a first staminate phase and a few bisexual catkins responsible for a second staminate phase. We hypothesized that duodichogamy increases female mating success by facilitating pollen deposition on stigmas of the rewardless female flowers through their proximity with attractive male flowers responsible for the minor staminate phase. MethodsWe monitored insect visits to 11 chestnut trees during the entire flowering period and explored reproductive traits of all known duodichogamous species using published evidence. ResultsIn chestnuts, insects visited trees more frequently during the first staminate phase but visited female flowers more frequently during the second staminate phase. All 21 animal-pollinated duodichogamous species identified are mass-flowering woody plants at high risk of self-pollination. In 20 of 21 cases, gynoecia (female flower parts) are located close to androecia (male flower parts), typically those responsible for the second minor staminate phase, whereas androecia are often distant from gynoecia. ConclusionsOur results suggest that duodichogamy increases female mating success by facilitating pollen deposition on stigmas by means of the attractiveness of the associated male flowers while effectively limiting self-pollination.

On this basis, the direct power control (DPC) theory of BDFRG is established, which makes up the deficiency that the DPC theory of BDFRG is only based on qualitative analysis in the existing literature. The power derivative expression is derived for accurately analyzing the effect of voltage vector of control winding (CW) on the power of PW, concluding that the control effect of DPC is related to the operation point of a BDFRG. The number of basic voltage vectors of CW connected with two-level converter is limited, resulting that under some operation conditions, a BDFRG controlled by DPC could present a time interval where the power cannot be controlled satisfactorily. Therefore, the space vector modulation-based direct power control (SVM-DPC) strategy of BDFRG is proposed, which can solve the above problem and fix the switching frequency. Experimental results prove the correctness of the elaboration and the proposed method. (C) 2023 Institute of Electrical Engineer of Japan and Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Four surgical techniques were used for sling revision (loosening, section, partial, and total excision). The primary endpoint was recurrence of SUI at 3 months postoperatively, and the other outcome of interest was the rate of subsequent anti-incontinence surgical procedure.ResultsSixty-nine patients were included for analysis. SUI recurred in 46.4% of patients. Fifteen patients underwent a subsequent anti-incontinence procedure (21.8%). The time to revision was significantly longer in the group with recurrent SUI (median: 84.5 vs. 44.8 months; p = 0.004). The recurrence rate differed significantly depending on the revision technique: 7.7% after sling loosening, 22.2% after sling section, 60% after partial excision, and 66.7% after complete sling removal (p = 0.001). The risk of SUI recurrence was lower for those whose indication of reoperation was voiding dysfunction (27.3% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.002), and was higher for those who underwent a trans-obturator tap rather than a tension-free vaginal tape revision (68.4% vs. 35.7%; p = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, only the revision technique remained significantly associated with the risk of recurrence of SUI (complete excision vs. section: odds ratio = 4.66; p = 0.04).ConclusionThe risk of SUI recurrence may differ widely according to the techniques used, and it seems that the less extensive the surgical procedure is, the lower the risk is.

The experiment results showed that the corrosion tendency of 6082 aluminum alloy in deicing salt strongly depends on its different matrix and grain boundary precipitates, which also show the characteristics of transformation during the corrosion process. The Nyquist plot exhibits the characteristics of double capacitive resistance arcs, and the capacitive resistance arcs were affected by corrosion characteristics and corrosion products on aluminum alloy surface. The nucleation and development of pitting and the formation of a passive film were closely related to the Si phase in the 6082 aluminum alloy.

However, its treatment indications require further investigation in different thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) status. Material and methodsThis was a secondary analysis of a Chinese prospective cohort in a real-world setting. Pregnant women with gestational SCH were enrolled at the first antenatal visit and grouped by TPOAb positivity. Child neurodevelopment was assessed by the Gesell development diagnosis scale (GDDS) at one, three, six, 12, and 24 months of age. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Clinical trial registration: NCT01744743. ResultsFrom January 2012 to December 2013, a total of 171 participants were enrolled, including 116 of SCH with TPOAb negative (SCH-TPOAb [-]) and 55 of SCH with TPOAb positive (SCH-TPOAb [+]). Compared to women in the SCH-TPOAb (+) group, those in the SCH-TPOAb (-) group had lower thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at enrollment and 12-16(+6) gestational weeks, and unexpectedly higher TSH levels at 30-34(+6) gestational weeks and delivery, with a correspondingly lower levothyroxine dosage throughout pregnancy (all p < 0.05). Offspring in the SCH-TPOAb (-) group displayed lower GDDS scores at one year old than did their counterparts (adjusted p < 0.05), which was possibly related to the worse thyroid function control of maternal SCH-TPOAb (-). No statistically significant difference was found in the GDDS assessments of children at one, three, six, and 24 months of age. These results were also confirmed in subgroup analyses stratified by maternal thyroid characteristics at enrollment, namely TSH levels, free levothyroxine (T-4) levels, and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) status, as well as in sensitivity analyses excluding participants with no levothyroxine treatment at enrollment. ConclusionsIn the current clinical practice, infants born to mothers with SCH-TPOAb (-) displayed slightly lower neurodevelopmental scores at one year old than did those born to mothers with SCH-TPOAb (+) but this difference was not seen at two years.

High-throughput phenotyping is required to breed varieties that satisfy consumer preferences. ResultsNear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) calibration curves were developed for analysing sugars in baked storage roots using 147 genotypes from a population segregating for sugar content and other traits. The NIRS prediction curves had high coefficients of determination in calibration (R-c(2)) of 0.96 (glucose), 0.93 (fructose), 0.96 (sucrose), and 0.96 (maltose). The corresponding coefficients of determination for cross-validation (R-cv(2)) were 0.92 (glucose), 0.89 (fructose), 0.96 (sucrose) and 0.93 (maltose) and were similar to the R-c(2) for all sugars measured. The ratios of the standard deviation of the reference set to the standard error of cross-validation were greater than three for all sugars. These results confirm the applicability of the NIRS curves in efficiently determining sugar content in baked sweetpotato storage roots. External validation was performed on an additional 70 genotypes. Coefficients of determination (r(2)) were 0.88 (glucose), 0.88 (fructose), 0.86 (sucrose) and 0.49 (maltose). The results were comparable to those found for the calibration and cross-validation in fructose, glucose, and sucrose, but were moderate for maltose due to the low variability of maltose content in the population. ConclusionsNIRS can be used for screening sugar content in baked sweetpotato storage roots in breeding programs and can be used to assist with the development of improved sweetpotato varieties that better meet consumer preferences. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

Surprisingly, trapped charges with a super-long lifetime of >2 h are detected in doped OLEDs operated at 20 K, which has never been discovered previously in the literature. However, the observations demonstrate that the longer lifetimes of these trapped charges are primarily governed by the larger spacing distances between trapped electrons and holes, rather than being solely determined by the well-accepted energy-level depth of trap states. More amazingly, compared with the device driven only by a conventional constant voltage source, a tenfold enhancement in light emission is achieved in low-temperature operational doped OLEDs powered by an alternating positive and negative pulse voltage, because the applied negative pulse voltage can assist these super-long-lived trapped electrons and holes to detrap and then recombine with each other for producing enhanced light-emission. Therefore, this study clarifies the dynamic behaviors of trapped charges and paves the pathway for obtaining high-performance OLEDs working in low-temperature circumstances such as outer-space or aerospace fields.

However, patients of Asian ancestry are susceptible to CBZ-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Universal HLA-B*15:02 screening is a promising intervention to address this. With the increasing recognition of integrating real-world evidence in economic evaluations, the cost-effectiveness of universal HLA-B*15:02 screening was assessed using available real-world data in Malaysia. MethodsA hybrid model of a decision tree and Markov model was developed to evaluate 3 strategies for treating newly diagnosed epilepsy among adults: (i) CBZ initiation without HLA-B*15:02 screening (current practice); (ii) universal HLA-B*15:02 screening prior to CBZ initiation; and (iii) alternative prescribing without HLA-B*15:02 screening. The model was populated with real-world inputs derived from the Malaysian population. From a societal perspective, base-case analysis and sensitivity analyses estimated the costs and outcomes over a lifetime. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. ResultsIn the base-cases analysis, universal HLA-B*15:02 screening yielded the lowest total costs and the highest total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Compared with current practice, universal screening was less costly by USD100 and more effective by QALYs increase of 0.1306, while alternative prescribing resulted in 0.1383 QALYs loss at additional costs of USD332. The highest seizure remission rate (56%) was estimated for universal HLA-B*15:02 screening vs. current practice (54%) and alternative prescribing (48%). ConclusionOur study suggests that universal HLA-B*15:02 screening is a cost-effective intervention in Malaysia. With the demonstrated value of real-world evidence in economic evaluations, more relevant standardization efforts should be emphasized to better inform decision-making.

Subjective economic inequality is associated with lower well-being through more upward comparison and lower trust	APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING			English	Article; Early Access						depression; economic inequality; life satisfaction; social comparison; subjective economic inequality; trust	INCOME INEQUALITY; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; LIFE SATISFACTION; SELF-DETERMINATION; UNITED-STATES; SOCIAL-STATUS; CONSEQUENCES; DEPRESSION; WEALTH; SCALE	Individuals often misconstrue the actual degree of economic inequality, which might account for the ambiguity in the literature about the role that inequality plays in well-being. Instead of focusing on objective inequality, we propose a subjective inequality approach by investigating the long-term association between subjective economic inequality and well-being (N = 613). We found that subjective inequality predicted lower life satisfaction and higher depression one year later, which were accounted for by more upward socioeconomic comparison and lower trust. Furthermore, the negative association between subjective inequality and well-being remained constant, regardless of individuals' objective socioeconomic status (SES), subjective SES, and mindset of SES. The long-term association between subjective inequality and well-being remained robust after controlling for prior levels of well-being and multiple covariates. Our findings revealed that subjective inequality is detrimental to well-being and opens a new window into psychological research on economic inequality.

Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water-driven Ni-Zn micromotor via a self-established electric-chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric-chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni-Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self-established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

By contrast, the outcomes of women with breast cancer (BC) have dramatically improved during the last 10 years, notably thanks to new therapeutic strategies. The aim of this article was to imagine what could be the future of therapy for dogs and cats with MCs if it became inspired from current practices in human BC. This article focuses on the importance of taking into account cancer stage and cancer subtypes in therapeutic plans, on locoregional treatments (surgery, radiation therapy), new developments in endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, PARP inhibitors and immunotherapy. Ideally, multimodal treatment regimens would be chosen according to cancer stage and cancer subtypes, and according to predictive factors that are still to be defined.

However, its practical applications are confined by poor durability and sluggish kinetics. Herein, an innovative in-situ electrochemically self-driven strategy is presented to embed phosphorus nanocrystal (& AP;10 nm) into a Fe-N-C-rich 3D carbon framework (P/Fe-N-C). This strategy enables rapid and high-capacity sodium ion storage. Through a combination of experimental assistance and theoretical calculations, a novel synergistic catalytic mechanism of Fe-N-C is reasonably proposed. In detail, the electrochemical formation of Fe-N-C catalytic sites facilitates the release of fluorine in ester-based electrolyte, inducing Na+-conducting-enhanced solid-electrolyte interphase. Furthermore, it also effectively induces the dissociation energy of the P-P bond and promotes the reaction kinetics of P anode. As a result, the unconventional P/Fe-N-C anode demonstrates outstanding rate-capability (267 mAh g(-1) at 100 A g(-1)) and cycling stability (72%, 10 000 cycles). Notably, the assembled pouch cell achieves high-energy density of 220 Wh kg(-1).

Life stress and adiposity in mothers: A 14-year follow-up in the general population	STRESS AND HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access						adiposity; BMI; life stress; parenting stress; waist circumference	BODY-MASS INDEX; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; MENTAL-HEALTH; OBESITY; ASSOCIATIONS; METAANALYSIS; EDUCATION; WEIGHT; STRAIN; IMPACT	Exposure to specific stressors has been found to associate with higher adiposity in adulthood. However, the potential overlapping effects of stress domains have been overlooked, as well as the role of parenting-related stressors that mothers are widely exposed to in mid-adulthood. Therefore, we assessed the association of overlapping effects of stress domains, including parenting-related stress, with subsequent adiposity in mothers. In 3957 mothers from the population-based Generation R Study, life stress was assessed during the first 10 years of child-rearing and measured as a reflective latent variable of stress domains. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the association of life stress and its individual domains with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference after 14 years of follow-up. Greater life stress over the course of 10 years was associated with a higher BMI (standardized adjusted difference: 0.57 kg/m(2) [95% CI: 0.41-0.72]) and a larger waist circumference (1.15 cm [0.72-1.57]). When examining individual stress domains, we found that life events was independently associated with a higher BMI (0.16 kg/m(2)) and contextual stress was independently associated with a higher BMI (0.43 kg/m(2)) and larger waist circumference (1.04 cm). Parenting stress and interpersonal stress were not independently associated with adiposity at follow-up. The overlap of multiple domains of stress in mothers is associated with a higher risk of adiposity. This effect was stronger than for individual life stress domains, reiterating the need to consider overlapping effects of different life stress domains.	[Hoepel, Sanne J.

However, this knowledge has been obtained from small-scale observations in fundamental rather than applied settings and has focused on a few species under ambient conditions. Therefore, there are several unaddressed questions on soil microbiome predators: (1) What is the role of microbiome predators in soil functioning? (2) How does global change affect microbiome predators and their functions? (3) How can microbiome predators be applied in agriculture? We show that there is sufficient evidence for the vital role of microbiome predators in soils and stress that global changes impact their functions, something that urgently needs to be addressed to better understand soil functioning as a whole. We are convinced that there is a potential for the application of microbiome predators in agricultural settings, as they may help to sustainably increase plant growth. Therefore, we plea for more applied research on microbiome predators.

The bimolecular recombination of free charge carriers leads to the formation of both singlet and triplet charge transfer (CT) states at a ratio of 1:3 when considering simple spin statistics, meaning that charge recombination via the triplet excited state is the main deactivation channel for OSCs. Although the formation of local triplet excitons through back charge transfer from triplet CT states is thought to be a terminal loss process, it is shown that charge separation from triplet excitons can occur in nonfullerene acceptor (NFA)-based OSCs. To reveal the triplet exciton dynamics, a triplet sensitizer PtTPBP is doped into an OSC consisting of PM6 and Y6 as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Upon photoexcitation of PtTPBP, triplet excitons are formed, which subsequently transfer their energy to Y6, resulting in Y6 triplet excitons formation. Based on transient absorption and external quantum efficiency measurements, clear experimental evidence of charge photogeneration from Y6 triplet excitons at the PM6:Y6 interface is provided. This study highlights the importance of minimizing the energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited states of NFAs to suppress charge recombination.

This connection, however, is largely based on the quantity of knowledge to be transferred rather than its characteristics. Building on the knowledge-based view, we propose that knowledge scope-the variety of knowledge across an organization's members-affects coordination costs and hierarchy expansion. Using an economy-wide database from Brazil, we show that firms are more likely to expand their hierarchy when knowledge scope increases. This effect varies with firms' capacities to manage knowledge; firms whose employees perform more similar tasks or have shared experience at previous employers are less likely to expand hierarchy in response to increases in knowledge scope.Managerial SummaryGrowing organizations often struggle to coordinate the work of their employees within their current organizational structures. We distinguish coordination problems generated by increased size from problems generated by expanding the variety of knowledge used and argue that both spur organizations to hire additional managers. Using a database of Brazilian startups, we show that a greater variety of knowledge used is associated with the expansion of hierarchy. Additionally, we find that organizations whose employees have more shared work experience have a greater ability to coordinate and thus delay the expansion of hierarchy. Overall, our results show the importance of the characteristics of an organization's knowledge base for organizational structure and suggest building teams with shared experience can enhance an organization's ability to adapt to coordination challenges.

In this paper, the accurate boundary conditions are determined by the Converge model and the transient parameters were introduced into the chemical kinetics model to make the operating conditions more closely match the actual engine operating conditions. The effects of different methane/n-heptane ratios, initial temperatures, initial pressures, and equivalence ratios on the IDT of methane/n-heptane fuel mixtures were analyzed using comprehensive chemical kinetic tools such as mole fraction analysis, ROP analysis, and sensitivity analysis. The IDT of methane/n-heptane mixture decreased significantly with increasing the equivalence ratio, initial pressure, and the proportion of n-heptane in the mixture, but the change of temperature was more complicated for the IDT. The NTC behavior of methane/n-heptane mixture was also affected by the NTC behavior of n-heptane. With the increase of initial temperature, the consumption of methane and n-heptane appeared to be significantly accelerated. The peak of radicals and intermediate groups appeared earliest and had the highest radical concentration when the n-heptane content was 30%. With the increase of initial pressure, the peak moments of the six radicals were further advanced, but the mole concentrations of O, OH, H radicals decreased significantly. This paper not only provides a reference for the design of NG/diesel dual-fuel engines, but also provides a theoretical basis and data support for improving the ignition and initial condition setting strategies of the engines.

Montserrat; Uribe, Regina Valdovinos; Olivier, Damien			Ecotourism impacts on reef fishes in a marine reserve during the COVID-19 era	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article								Marine reserves generally permit ecotourism within their boundaries as a source of income for local communities, but the impacts of ecotourism on wildlife are still poorly understood. The lockdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 provided a unique opportunity to evaluate wildlife diversity in the absence of human activity. In a marine reserve in Mexico, we monitored fish assemblages before, during, and immediately after the lockdown to examine ecotourism impacts on fish assemblages. Our results show that fish density rose 2.5-fold during the lockdown, suggesting that ecotourism activities alter fish behavior. We suggest that the presence of divers and noise pollution generated by recreational vessels are important disturbance factors. In the absence of human activity, however, some fish may be more bold (hide less often) or may return to the reserve after having retreated to more tranquil (deepwater) areas. We hope that our findings spur efforts to improve the health of marine reserves through the establishment of effective management strategies to mitigate ecotourism impacts.

Toward a definition of nursing philosophy based on an interpretive synthesis of the recent literature	NURSING INQUIRY			English	Article; Early Access						interpretive synthesis; literature review; nursing knowledge and practice; nursing philosophy	QUALITATIVE METASYNTHESIS; CARE; REFLECTIONS; SCIENCE	Nursing claims a significant history of engaging philosophical inquiry. To better understand the rationale for this engagement, and what nursing understands itself to achieve through philosophical inquiry, we conducted an interpretive synthesis of the recent nursing literature to identify what nurses are doing when they say they are doing philosophy. The overarching finding was that while vanishingly few articles articulated any definition of philosophy, the synthesis showed how nursing considers philosophical engagement a generative mode for asking and answering questions in/for nursing. Whatever aspects of nursing were focused on in these articles, and they were myriad, philosophy was invoked as an appropriate modality to work through that aspect rigorously, critically, and with an expectation that something "knowledgeable" would result from the effort. Based on the synthesis, we conclude that nursing philosophy could be considered a specific modality of nursing practice by which nursing is both done and delineated, a discursive practice in which we continually assess and explore and adapt and advance our understanding of the discipline in service to advancing our unique efficacy. This definition of "nursing philosophy" provides an opening for further inquiry helping to illuminate its functionalities and potentialities for outputs that can facilitate rigorous practice, education, and scholarship.

Although established after these two collections, the Kyoto Collection of Human Embryos and Fetuses has become the largest collection worldwide, and its major asset is 1044 serial tissue sections comprising 547 normal and 497 abnormal cases. Morphological changes have been the focus of analysis owing to the absence of fresh embryos in the Kyoto Collection. Furthermore, analysis methods have undergone significant changes. For example, morphometrics has been used to quantitatively analyze shape changes, although it may result in the loss of information on shape changes, which can hinder the visualization of analysis results. However, geometric morphometrics has been recently introduced to the fetal and embryonic stages to circumvent this problem. With the development of DNA analysis kits, several hundred DNA base pairs have been extracted from the Kyoto Collection of studies conducted from the 2000s to the 2010s through genetic analysis. Future technological advances are eagerly awaited.

White matter repair plays an important role in the long-term recovery of neurological function after cerebral ischemia. Neuroprotective microglial responses can promote white matter repair and protect ischemic brain tissue. AimsThe aim of this study was to investigate whether hypoxic postconditioning (HPC) can promote white matter repair after IS, and the role and mechanism of microglial polarization in white matter repair after HPC treatment. Materials & MethodsAdult male C57/BL6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham group (Sham), MCAO group (MCAO), and hypoxic postconditioning group (HPC). HPC group were subjected to 45 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) immediately followed by 40 min of HPC. ResultsThe results showed that HPC reduced the proinflammatory level of immune cells. Furthermore, HPC promoted the transformation of microglia to anti-inflammatory phenotype on the third day after the procedure. HPC promoted the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and increased the expression of myelination-related proteins on the 14th day. On the 28th day, HPC increased the expression of mature oligodendrocytes, which enhanced myelination. At the same time, the motor neurological function of mice was restored. DiscussionDuring the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, the function of proinflammatory immune cells was enhanced, long-term white matter damage was aggravated, and motor sensory function was decreased. ConclusionHPC promotes protective microglial responses and white matter repair after MCAO, which may be related to the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes.

Patients with NUG were split into two groups: Group-OD + PDT received PDT with OD, while Group-OD underwent OD alone. Clinical inflammatory parameters including full mouth plaque scores (FMPS), full mouth bleeding scores (FMBS), and probing depth (PD) were assessed. Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Pain examination was done using various pain scales. Group PDT + OD showed more reduction in FMPS, FMBS, and greater reduction in F. nucleatum and P. intermedia count compared to group OD at 12 weeks follow up (p < 0.01). Group PDT + OD showed significantly lower pain scores at 12 weeks (p < 0.05). PDT was more effective in improving clinical parameters, and reducing bacterial counts and pain in NUG patients than dental scaling alone.	[Al-Kheraif, Abdulaziz A.

ICP is diagnosed by non-fasting TSBA & GE;19 & mu;mol/L in a pregnant woman with pruritus without rash without a known pre-existing liver disorder. Peak TSBA & GE;40 and & GE;100 & mu;mol/L identify severe and very severe disease respectively, associated with spontaneous preterm birth when severe, and with stillbirth, when very severe. Benefit-vs-risk for iatrogenic preterm birth in ICP remains uncertain. Ursodeoxycholic acid remains the best pharmacotherapy preterm, improving perinatal outcome and reducing pruritus, although it has not been shown to reduce stillbirth.

Palmitic acid and stearic acid were the chief free fatty acids in chicken broth. 530 and 236 small molecule metabolites were found. 36 volatile compounds were identified in chicken broth, mainly aldehydes. The proportion of sweet and umami amino acids in the chicken broth of the 600 W ultrasonic treatment group accounted for 63% of the total polypeptide sequence, indicating that pre-ultrasonication can increase the content of sweet and umami polypeptides in chicken soup. The overall taste and flavour of Wuding chicken soup under pre-ultrasonication with 600 W power were the best combined with sensory evaluation scores. These results can provide scientific and theoretical guidance for the further understanding of the effect of ultrasound assistance on the quality of chicken broth and the intensive processing of local chicken.

The trigonal structure (space group P 3? ${\overline{3}}$ m1, a=4.0443(3) & ANGS;, c=14.923(2) & ANGS;, V=211.38(4) & ANGS;(3); Z=2) consists of Ge bilayers sandwiched by Ga-Te layers. Ge and Ga are tetrahedrally coordinated. The layer packages are separated by a van der Waals gap with a Te-Te distance of 4.1502(7) & ANGS;. The structure resembles that of GaGeTe but features an additional Ge atom layer. Despite small scattering contrast of Ga and Ge, precise high-resolution data enable unequivocal atom assignment as confirmed by R values of different models. DFT calculations suggest only a small extent of charge transfer, which is confirmed by both Bader and Mulliken charges. Thus, bonding within the layer packages is predominantly covalent, especially between Ga and Ge. Formal oxidation states according to (GaGeGe-ITe-II)-Ge-III-Ge-(0), i. e. assuming rather ionic Ge-Ga bonds, convey a much less realistic situation than (GaGe2Te-II)-Ge-II-Te-(0), which is in line with GaGeTe.

In the mouse, DSBs are formed by the catalytic TOPOVIL complex consisting of SPO11 and TOPOVIBL. To preserve genome integrity, the activity of the TOPOVIL complex is finely controlled by several meiotic factors including REC114, MEI4, and IHO1, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we report that mouse REC114 forms homodimers, that it associates with MEI4 as a 2:1 heterotrimer that further dimerizes, and that IHO1 forms coiled-coil-based tetramers. Using AlphaFold2 modeling combined with biochemical characterization, we uncovered the molecular details of these assemblies. Finally, we show that IHO1 directly interacts with the PH domain of REC114 by recognizing the same surface as TOPOVIBL and another meiotic factor ANKRD31. These results provide strong evidence for the existence of a ternary IHO1-REC114-MEI4 complex and suggest that REC114 could act as a potential regulatory platform mediating mutually exclusive interactions with several partners.

There are three types of GM1 gangliosidosis based on age of symptom onset, which correlate with disease severity. In 2019, we performed a retrospective multicentric study including all patients diagnosed with GM1 gangliosidosis in France since 1998. We had access to data for 61 of the 88 patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2019. There were 41 patients with type 1 (symptom onset & LE;6 months), 11 with type 2a (symptom onset from 7 months to 2 years), 5 with type 2b (symptom onset from 2 to 3 years), and 4 with type 3 (symptom onset >3 years). The estimated incidence in France was 1/210000. In patients with type 1, the first symptoms were hypotonia (26/41, 63%), dyspnea (7/41, 17%), and nystagmus (6/41, 15%), whereas in patients with type 2a, these were psychomotor regression (9/11, 82%) and seizures (3/11, 27%). In types 2b and 3, the initial symptoms were mild, such as speech difficulties, school difficulties, and progressive psychomotor regression. Hypotonia was observed in all patients, except type 3. The mean overall survival was 23 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7, 39) for type 1 and 9.1 years (95% CI: 4.5, 13.5) for type 2a. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the largest historical cohorts reported, which provides important information on the evolution of all types of GM1 gangliosidosis. These data could be used as a historical cohort in studies assessing potential therapies for this rare genetic disease.

Fermentation significantly affected the physiochemical properties. Fermentation for 24 h improved the carotenoid (TCC), ascorbic acid (AA) (6.8, 6.0 mg 100 g(-1)) and total phenolic (4435 mg 100 g(-1)) significantly in, 'Bophelo' smoothies. Whilst 48 h fermentation significantly increased the TCC, AA, organic acids, valine and alanine levels in 'Blesbok' smoothies'. Principal component analysis separated the unfermented 'Bophelo' and Purple-purple' leaf smoothies from fermented leaf smoothies of OFSP, CSFP, and PFSP. DPPH scavenging activity and alpha-carotene were effective markers for separating fermented from unfermented leaf smoothies in the variable importance study. Survival of L75 was influenced by fermentation duration and cultivar type. Fermented and unfermented smoothies were equally acceptable.

Students were invited to complete the survey fortnightly, whereas senior medical and nursing staff were invited weekly.Results: There was a 32% response rate for surveys sent to medical student assistants (MSAs) and 18% and 15% for medical and nursing staff, respectively. Most students felt well prepared and supported in the role and would recommend it to other students. They reported that the role allowed them to gain experience and confidence within the ED, especially after much of their learning had moved online throughout the pandemic. Senior nurses and doctors found MSAs to be useful members of the team, largely through their assistance with task completion. Both staff and students recommended a more comprehensive orientation, changes to the supervision model and increased clarity in the students' scope of practice.Conclusions: The results of the present study provide insight into the use of medical students as an emergency surge workforce. Responses from medical students and staff suggested that the project was beneficial for both groups as well as for overall departmental performance. These findings are likely to be translatable beyond the COVID-19 pandemic setting.

In this paper three anionic silicone surfactants were synthesized first time from dichloromethylvinylsilane through hydrolysis-condensation, "thiol-ene" photo- chemical and then salting reaction. The critical aggregate concentration (CAC), surface tension, minimum surface area per surfactant molecule and surface pressure at CAC were studied by both surface tension and electrical conductivity. The results showed that they had significant surface activity at the gas/liquid interface and were capable to reduce the surface tension of water to approximately 20 mN m(-1). The results of transmission electron microscopy showed that the three silicone surfactants self-assembled into spherical aggregates of uniform size in aqueous solution above the CAC. The dynamic light scattering results demonstrated that the size of the aggregates was determined to be in the range from 60 to 300 nm at 0.05 mol L-1 and the order of the size of the aggregates is (Me3SiO)(3)SiCO2Li<(Me3SiO)(3)SiCO2Na<(Me3SiO)(3)SiCO2K.

Design Parameters for Injectable Biopolymeric Hydrogels with Dynamic Covalent Chemistry Crosslinks	ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						biomaterials; elastin-like proteins; hydrogels; injectable	HYALURONIC-ACID HYDROGELS; TRAPPED ENTANGLEMENTS; CLICK-CHEMISTRY; YIELD-STRESS; POLYMER; DEGRADATION; BIOMATERIALS; NETWORKS; VISCOELASTICITY; POLYSACCHARIDE	Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) crosslinks can form hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties permissive to injectability and self-healing. However, not all hydrogels with transient crosslinks are easily extrudable. For this reason, two additional design parameters must be considered when formulating DCC-crosslinked hydrogels: 1) degree of functionalization (DoF) and 2) polymer molecular weight (MW). To investigate these parameters, hydrogels comprised of two recombinant biopolymers: 1) a hyaluronic acid (HA) modified with benzaldehyde and 2) an elastin-like protein (ELP) modified with hydrazine (ELP-HYD), are formulated. Several hydrogel families are synthesized with distinct HA MW and DoF while keeping the ELP-HYD component constant. The resulting hydrogels have a range of stiffnesses, G & PRIME; & AP; 10-1000 Pa, and extrudability, which is attributed to the combined effects of DCC crosslinks and polymer entanglements. In general, lower MW formulations require lower forces for injectability, regardless of stiffness. Higher DoF formulations exhibit more rapid self-healing. Gel extrusion through a cannula (2 m length, 0.25 mm diameter) demonstrates the potential for minimally invasive delivery for future biomedical applications. In summary, this work highlights additional parameters that influence the injectability and network formation of DCC-crosslinked hydrogels and aims to guide future design of injectable hydrogels.

The mahogany-fruit-shell-derived activated carbon (MSAC) is produced using chemical activation, followed by carbonization at various carbonization temperatures (500, 600, 700, and 800 & DEG;C) and activation ratios (MS:KOH = 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3). The high-performance MSAC has an intricate porous structure with a surface area of 1072 m(2) g(-1). It exhibits a specific capacitance of 267 F g(-1) and outstanding capacitance retention of 97% even after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. The MSAC-based FSCs are constructed utilizing a gel polymer electrolyte (poly(vinyl alcohol)|sodium sulfate), and their performance is compared with that of conventional supercapacitor systems. The MSAC-based FSC shows a very high specific capacitance of 121 F g(-1), which is remarkably superior to previously reported FSCs. Additionally, as-prepared FSC exhibits wide electrochemical window, flexibility, ease of handling, safety, along with a high capacitance retention of 78% after 2000 charging-discharging cycles. These exceptional capacitive properties, such as its extended cycle life and excellent rate capability, suggest that it is a potential alternative for a range of next-generation energy storage applications.

Based on the theoretical framework of complex adaptive blended learning system (CABLS), this article presents a holistic and systematic view of BL for higher GIS education (termed as CABLS-GIS), where its key components are tightly integrated as an integral whole. The framework was implemented for an introductory-level GIS course to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of a BL design from students' perspectives. Most students involved in the implementation agreed that the BL enhanced their learning outcomes. They were mostly positive about the BL and motivated to use the BL materials.

J	Alshehri, A; Ullah, S				Alshehri, Ahmed; Ullah, Saif			Mathematical analysis of monkeypox infection with optimal control analysis: A case study with a new outbreak in the United States	MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						mathematical modeling; monkeypox outbreak; optimal control theory; parameter estimation and prediction; simulation	MODELS; TUBERCULOSIS; STABILITY; EPIDEMIC	Monkeypox infection is a serious illness to human health, and its outbreak has been reported in many non-endemic regions. Various approaches have been implemented to explore the epidemiology, transmission patterns, and effective control of monkeypox. In this paper, we focus on the implementation of a mathematical modeling approach to study the dynamics of monkeypox infection with a case study of the United States, the most impacted country in 2022. The proposed mathematical model is initially constructed using a nonlinear system of differential equations with constant control measures. The human population is divided into four subgroups while the animal (non-human) population is divided into three subclasses. An extensive theoretical analysis of the proposed monkeypox model is presented including the stability of equilibria. Further, to make the present study more visible to the literature, a real data set of the cumulative confirmed cases of monkeypox in the United States from May to October 2022 is used to estimate the proposed model parameters. Some of the demographic parameters are estimated from the population of the United States. The most important biological parameter R0$$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ of the problem is investigated theoretically as well as numerically based on the reported cases. The impact of various model parameters on the dynamics of state variables and R0$$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ is shown graphically. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of various model parameters on the basic reproduction number to explore the most influential intervention strategy to curb the infection. The most crucial components of the proposed system are identified and health officials are advised. Finally, using optimization theory, the most effective optimized preventive strategies are suggested to curtail the infection in a community. We believe that the present investigation will be helpful in understanding the dynamics and prevention of monkeypox infection.

Enhancing measurement validity in diverse populations: Modern approaches to evaluating differential item functioning	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						differential item functioning; factor analysis; item response theory; measurement; psychometrics	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; RESPONSE THEORY; MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE; LATENT INTERACTIONS; MEASUREMENT BIAS; DETECTING DIF; MIMIC-MODEL; IRT-C; SIZE	When developing and evaluating psychometric measures, a key concern is to ensure that they accurately capture individual differences on the intended construct across the entire population of interest. Inaccurate assessments of individual differences can occur when responses to some items reflect not only the intended construct but also construct-irrelevant characteristics, like a person's race or sex. Unaccounted for, this item bias can lead to apparent differences on the scores that do not reflect true differences, invalidating comparisons between people with different backgrounds. Accordingly, empirically identifying which items manifest bias through the evaluation of differential item functioning (DIF) has been a longstanding focus of much psychometric research. The majority of this work has focused on evaluating DIF across two (or a few) groups. Modern conceptualizations of identity, however, emphasize its multi-determined and intersectional nature, with some aspects better represented as dimensional than categorical. Fortunately, many model-based approaches to modelling DIF now exist that allow for simultaneous evaluation of multiple background variables, including both continuous and categorical variables, and potential interactions among background variables. This paper provides a comparative, integrative review of these new approaches to modelling DIF and clarifies both the opportunities and challenges associated with their application in psychometric research.

The most widespread industrial process for water treatment is the activated sludge process, in which, however, excessive sludge production has become an enormous environmental problem worldwide. To overcome this problem, hydrogels possess outstanding potential in view of adsorptive removal of contaminants like heavy metal ions, fertilizers, and dyes. In this paper, we report about the synthesis of biobased alginate hydrogel beads along with polyethyleneimine-modified composite hydrogels for water treatment. The adsorption of methylene blue as a positively charged and of congo red as a negatively charged model dye is quantitatively investigated, both separately and in combination. In addition, the pH-dependent adsorption of the dyes is determined. The use of alginate-based hydrogel systems combines several prospects: they are bio-based, inexpensive, easily available to a sufficient extent, sustainable, and are applicable in a broad range of wastewater treatment by its charged groups.

Yet while there is an increasing diversity and volume of marine biodiversity data for training SDMs, little practical guidance is available on how to leverage distinct data types to build robust models. We explored the effect of different data types on the fit, performance and predictive ability of SDMs by comparing models trained with four data types for a heavily exploited pelagic fish, the blue shark (Prionace glauca), in the Northwest Atlantic: two fishery dependent (conventional mark-recapture tags, fisheries observer records) and two fishery independent (satellite-linked electronic tags, pop-up archival tags). We found that all four data types can result in robust models, but differences among spatial predictions highlighted the need to consider ecological realism in model selection and interpretation regardless of data type. Differences among models were primarily attributed to biases in how each data type, and the associated representation of absences, sampled the environment and summarized the resulting species distributions. Outputs from model ensembles and a model trained on all pooled data both proved effective for combining inferences across data types and provided more ecologically realistic predictions than individual models. Our results provide valuable guidance for practitioners developing SDMs. With increasing access to diverse data sources, future work should further develop truly integrative modeling approaches that can explicitly leverage the strengths of individual data types while statistically accounting for limitations, such as sampling biases.

J	Chen, FB; Zong, ZY; Yin, XY; Yang, ZF; Yan, XF				Chen, Fubin; Zong, Zhaoyun; Yin, Xingyao; Yang, Zhifang; Yan, Xinfei			Pressure and frequency dependence of elastic moduli of fluid-saturated dual-porosity rocks	GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING			English	Article						acoustics; attenuation; elastics; modelling; rock physics	SQUIRT; WAVE; ATTENUATION; DISPERSION; MODEL	The elastic moduli of subsurface rocks saturated with geofluid often depend on the wave frequency and confining pressure due to the wave-induced fluid flow and their significant intrinsic compressibility. Therefore, the knowledge of the pressure-dependent dispersion of elastic moduli is usually used in broad practical scenarios such as geofluid discrimination and in situ abnormal pressure detection. We propose a simple dual-porosity model to describe the pressure and frequency dependence of elastic moduli of fluid-saturated rocks. First, we follow the idea of the Shapiro dual-porosity model to yield more accurate formulas for pressure-dependent stiff porosity and crack porosity. Then the new formulas for stiff and crack porosities are utilized to express the bulk and shear moduli of dry rocks as a function of pressure. Further, the bulk and shear moduli of a modified frame (i.e. a rock skeleton with the dry stiff pores and fluid-saturated cracks) are formulated with the pressure-dependent elastic moduli of dry rock. In order to consider the wave energy attenuation induced by fluid in cracks, the frequency-independent fluid modulus imbedded in the formulas for bulk and shear moduli of a modified frame is replaced with a frequency-dependent one incorporating the effect of viscoelastic relaxation. The effective bulk and shear moduli of entire fluid-saturated body can be computed by inserting the pressure-dependent stiff porosity and elastic moduli of a modified frame into the Gassmann equation. Moreover, appropriate simplification is performed on the central equations in the case of low porosity and weak deformation of stiff pores to yield an approximate model. Modelling results show that the proposed model can reasonably account for the nonlinear variation of bulk and shear moduli with the elevating effective pressure and cautiously predict the wave dispersion and attenuation. We validate our model by comparing the predicted elastic moduli with the corresponding results given by Shapiro model-based equations and with the laboratory measurements of five different fluid-saturated rock samples.

However, current researches on low-temperature PIBs are limited to half cells utilizing potassium metal as an anode, and realizing rechargeable full cells is challenged by lacking viable anode materials and compatible electrolytes. Herein, a hard carbon (HC)-based low-temperature potassium-ion full cell is successfully fabricated for the first time. Experimental evidence and theoretical analysis revealed that potassium storage behaviors of HC anodes in the matched low-temperature electrolyte involve defect adsorption, interlayer co-intercalation, and nanopore filling. Notably, these unique potassiation processes exhibited low interfacial resistances and small reaction activation energies, enabling an excellent cycling performance of HC with a capacity of 175 mAh g(-1) at -40 & DEG;C (68 % of its room-temperature capacity). Consequently, the HC-based full cells demonstrated impressive rechargeability and high energy density above 100 Wh kg(cathode)(-1) at -40 & DEG;C, representing a significant advancement in the development of PIBs.

Inclusive literature research until April 2023 was done, and 1273 interconnected researches were reviewed. From a total of 11 researches that were chosen, 2559 ELC procedures in LC patients were at the starting point of the researches: 1273 of them were utilising RBs and 1286 were controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilised to appraise the consequence of RBs in preventing SSWI in ELC in LC patients by the dichotomous approach and a fixed or random model. RBs had significantly lower SSWI (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.76, p < 0.001) compared with controls in ELC in LC patients. However, no significant difference was found between RBs and controls in ELC in LC patients in bile spillage (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.21-1.24, p = 0.14), fascial extension (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.07-4.11, p = 0.55), postoperative collection (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.24-1.76, p = 0.40) and port site hernia (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.25-2.06, p = 0.54). RBs had significantly lower SSWI, and no significant difference was found in bile spillage, fascial extension, postoperative collection and port site hernia compared with controls in ELC in LC patients.

The clinical course is variable, with episodes of remission and exacerbation. A clinicopathological scoring system for cutaneous LP is not available for effectively assessing disease severity and monitoring treatment response. This study was designed with the aim of proposing an objective and reproducible scoring system, comprising histopathological features of active and chronic disease, and to correlate these scores with clinical morphology groups.Methodology This is a retrospective study of 200 cases of cutaneous LP, which were categorized into five clinical groups (I-V) at the time of biopsy. The corresponding histopathological feature was assigned a score based on feature of active and chronic disease. Individual scores were summated to calculate a histopathological index (index [AI] and chronicity index [CI]). The comparison of indices between various clinical groups was performed by Mann-Whitney U test.Results The median AI was lowest (1) for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (clinical group I) and highest (7) for the bullous group (clinical group IV). The median CI (7) was highest for the scarring group (clinical group V). The difference between median AI of clinical group I (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and rest of the groups (clinical groups II, III, IV, and V) was statistically significant (p value <0.05).Conclusion We present this clinico-histopathological scoring system as a reliable and facile method of assessing the activity and severity of LP.

Traumatic brain injury and mental health outcomes among recently incarcerated men	JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS			English	Article; Early Access							PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; HIGH-RISK; RECIDIVISM; PRISON; CONSEQUENCES; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; SYMPTOMS	This study examined the association between experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI) before or during incarceration and several postrelease negative mental health consequences in a cohort of men recently released from prison. The goal of the study was to explicate the variety of mental health-related issues incurring a TBI has on one's ability to successfully reintegrate back into society following incarceration. Using data from the LoneStar Project, we used ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms, stress, trauma flashbacks, and psychosis in a representative sample of men released from Texas prisons (N = 498) approximately 9 months post-prison release. Recently released men with a history of head injury exhibited higher levels of depression, B = 0.204, 95% CI [.071, .337]; stress, B = 0.266, 95% CI [.116, .416]; experiencing trauma-related flashbacks, odds ratio (OR) = 2.950, 95% CI [1.740, 5.001]; and psychosis, OR = 3.093, 95% CI [1.601, 5.975], compared to their non-head-injured counterparts. TBIs-whether sustained before or during incarceration-pose significant risks for adverse mental health outcomes, particularly for recently released individuals during the already challenging and strained period of reintegration.

Here, we explored how microbial communities utilized different carbon substrates and the underlying ecological mechanisms along a space-for-time substitution temperature gradient of future climate change. The gradient included 47 lakes from five major lake regions in China spanning a difference of nearly 15? in mean annual temperatures (MAT). Our results indicated that lakes from warmer regions generally had lower values of variables related to carbon concentrations and greater carbon utilization than those from colder regions. The greater utilization of carbon substrates under higher temperatures could be attributed to changes in bacterial community composition, with a greater abundance of Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteriota and less Proteobacteria in warmer lake regions. We also found that the core species in microbial networks changed with increasing temperature, from Hydrogenophaga and Rhodobacteraceae, which inhibited the utilization of amino acids and carbohydrates, to the CL500-29-marine-group, which promoted the utilization of all almost carbon substrates. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can mediate aquatic carbon utilization by changing the interactions between bacteria and individual carbon substrates, and the discovery of core species that affect carbon utilization provides insight into potential carbon sequestration within inland water bodies under future climate warming.

J	He, F; Xie, T; Ni, D; Tang, TT; Cheng, X				He, Fang; Xie, Tian; Ni, Dong; Tang, Tingting; Cheng, Xiang			Efficacy and safety of inhibiting the NLRP3/IL-1β/IL-6 pathway in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: A meta-analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Review; Early Access						anakinra; colchicine; interleukin; meta-analysis; NLRP3; STEMI; tocilizumab	C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME; LOW-DOSE COLCHICINE; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS; INTERLEUKIN-1; INFLAMMATION; DISEASE; TRIAL; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION	BackgroundThe NLRP3/IL-1 & beta;/IL-6 pathway plays a key role in mediating inflammatory responses after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the clinical benefits of inhibiting this pathway in STEMI are uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhibiting the NLRP3/IL-1 & beta;/IL-6 pathway in STEMI patients. MethodsThis study followed PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of inhibiting the NLRP3/IL-1 & beta;/IL-6 pathway in STEMI patients within 7 days of symptom onset. The efficacy outcomes included all-cause death, cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, new-onset or worsening heart failure (HF) and stroke. The safety outcomes were serious infection, gastrointestinal adverse events and injection site reactions. ResultsOf 316 screened records, nine trials with 1211 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Colchicine reduced the risk of recurrent MI (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.74; I-2 = 0.0%). Anakinra was associated with reduced risk of new-onset or worsening HF (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.77; I-2 = 0.0%) and decreased C-reactive protein levels (SMD -1.34, 95% CI -2.04 to -0.65; I-2 = 0.0%). Colchicine and anakinra increased the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 4.43, 95% CI 2.75-7.13; I-2 = 38.1%) and injection site reactions (RR 4.52, 95% CI 1.32-15.49; I-2 = 0.8%), respectively. None of the three medications affected the risks of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, stroke and serious infection. ConclusionsThere is still no large-scale RCT evidence on the efficacy and safety of inhibiting the NLRP3/IL-1 & beta;/IL-6 pathway for the treatment of STEMI. Preliminary results from the available RCTs suggest colchicine and anakinra may respectively reduce the risks of recurrent MI and new-onset or worsening HF. The available RCTs in this meta-analysis lack power to determine any differences on mortality.

Thus, the endogenously controllable on-site exposure/activation of DNA circuits is highly desirable for achieving the selective imaging of live cells. Herein, an endogenously activated DNAzyme strategy was facilely integrated with a catalytic DNA circuit for guiding the selective and efficient microRNA imaging in vivo. To prevent the off-site activation, the circuitry constitute was initially caged without sensing functions, which could be selectively liberated by DNAzyme amplifier to guarantee the high-contrast microRNA imaging in target cells. This intelligent on-site modulation strategy can tremendously expand these molecularly engineered circuits in biological systems.

Contrasting life histories and mating systems have the potential to limit gene exchange between closely related populations growing in sympatry. However, few studies have quantified reproductive isolating barriers between conspecific annual and perennial populations and their contributions to total reproductive isolation (RI). Incarvillea sinensis Lam. (Bignoniaceae) is an insect-pollinated herb with largely allopatric annual and perennial populations that differ in mating systems. The perennial populations are primarily outcrossing whereas annual populations are predominantly selfing. At a rare sympatric site in northern China we estimated prezygotic and postzygotic barriers to gene exchange between annual and perennial plants and found complete RI between the two life histories. Annuals exhibited significantly higher ecogeographic isolation than perennials whereas perennials experienced more isolation through pollen-pistil interactions than annuals. Crosses between annuals and perennials demonstrated that postzygotic barriers influencing fruit and seed formation, F-1 germination and survival were negligible for annuals but played a small role for perennials. However, F-1 hybrids of crosses between annuals and perennials produced no pollen and their ovules were largely sterile. Our study provides insight into the relative importance of prezygotic and postzygotic isolating barriers between closely related annual and perennial populations of I. sinensis and some of these barriers could have been involved with speciation. Annuals and perennials of I. sinensis represent two biological species and thus deserve to be recognized as distinct taxonomic species.

This natural difference may uncover the evolutionary forces and molecular features that define longevity. To understand the relationship between gene expression variation and longevity, we conducted a comparative transcriptomics analysis of liver, kidney, and brain tissues of 103 mammalian species. We found that few genes exhibit common expression patterns with longevity in the three organs analyzed. However, pathways related to translation fidelity, such as nonsense-mediated decay and eukaryotic translation elongation, correlated with longevity across mammals. Analyses of selection pressure found that selection intensity related to the direction of longevity-correlated genes is inconsistent across organs. Furthermore, expression of methionine restriction-related genes correlated with longevity and was under strong selection in long-lived mammals, suggesting that a common strategy is utilized by natural selection and artificial intervention to control lifespan. Our results indicate that lifespan regulation via gene expression is driven through polygenic and indirect natural selection.

In this work, a template electrospinning strategy is developed to synthesize nitrogen and phosphorous co-doped hollow porous carbon nanofibers (N, P-HPCNFs), which deliver a high capacity of 230.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), superior rate capability of 131.0 mAh g(-1) at 20 A g(-1), and a maximum energy density of 196.10 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 155.53 W kg(-1). Density functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal that the introduced P dopants regulate the distribution of local charge density of carbon materials and therefore facilitate the adsorption of Zn ions due to the increased electronegativity of pyridinic-N. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate that the doped P species induce a series of polar sites and create a hydrophilic microenvironment, which decreases the impedance between the electrode and the electrolyte and therefore accelerates the reaction kinetics. The marriage of ex situ/in situ experimental analyses and theoretical simulations uncovers the origin of the enhanced zincophilicity and hydrophilicity of N, P-HPCNFs for energy storage, which accounts for the faster ion migration and electrochemical processes.

Foundational to the development of trauma-informed services is collaboration with people with lived experience of trauma. Co-production principles may provide a useful framework for this collaboration, due to their emphasis on lived experience, and intent to address power imbalances and promote equity. This article aims to examine trauma-informed and co-production principles to consider the extent to which they overlap and explore how to tailor co-production approaches to support people who have experienced trauma. MethodsBridging Gaps is a collaboration between women who have experienced complex trauma, a charity that supports them, primary care clinicians and health researchers to improve access to trauma-informed primary care. Using co-production principles, we aimed to ensure that women who have experienced trauma were key decision-makers throughout the project. Through reflective notes (n = 19), observations of meetings (n = 3), interviews with people involved in the project (n = 9) and reflective group discussions on our experiences, we share learning, successes and failures. Data analysis followed a framework approach, using trauma-informed principles. ResultsCo-production processes can require adaptation when working with people who have experienced trauma. We emphasise the need for close partnership working, flexibility and transparency around power dynamics, paying particular attention to aspects of power that are less readily visible. Sharing experiences can retrigger trauma. People conducting co-production work need to understand trauma and how this may impact upon an individual's sense of psychological safety. Long-term funding is vital to enable projects to have enough time for the establishment of trust and delivery of tangible results. ConclusionsCo-production principles are highly suitable when developing trauma-informed services. Greater consideration needs to be given as to whether and how people share lived experiences, the need for safe spaces, honesty and humility, difficult dynamics between empowerment and safety and whether and when blurring boundaries may be helpful. Our findings have applicability to policy-making, funding and service provision to enable co-production processes to become more trauma-informed. Public ContributionBridging Gaps was started by a group of women who have experienced complex trauma, including addiction, homelessness, mental health problems, sexual exploitation, domestic and sexual violence and poverty, with a general practitioner (GP) who provides healthcare to this population, alongside a support worker from the charity One25, a charity that supports some of the most marginalised women in Bristol to heal and thrive. More GPs and healthcare researchers joined the group and they have been meeting fortnightly for a period of 4 years with the aim of improving access to trauma-informed primary care. The group uses co-production principles to work together, and we aim to ensure that women who have experienced trauma are key decision-makers throughout our work together. This article is a summary of our learning, informed by discussion, observations and interviews with members of the group.

Compared to the corresponding open-loop Nash equilibrium, both the agents' optimal trading rates and their performance move towards the central-planner solution, in that excessive trading due to lack of coordination is reduced.

Assembly processes can be understood as a set of filters acting at different spatio-temporal scales that jointly define the structure and composition of communities. Here, we explore the underlying assembly processes shaping marine fish species distribution and composition, using the heavily exploited North Sea. Our aims are to study 1) the relative importance of the different assembly processes shaping marine fish communities, 2) the key environmental drivers determining species distributions and composition, and to 3) quantify the role of traits in determining species niches and responses to the environment. Specifically, we fit a joint species distribution model (JSDM) using 31 years of standardized scientific bottom trawl survey data for 67 fish species. We use a set of environmental variables and species' traits representing morphology, life history, reproduction and diet, while also accounting for phylogenetic relationships of species. Environmental variables, primarily related to temperature, explained over one third of the variance in species occurrence, while spatial effects explained half of the variability across species. This shows that environmental filtering and spatially-structured processes are the main drivers shaping the community assembly. Furthermore, among the total variance of individual species occurrences, 12.5% could be explained by traits, which improve the mechanistic understanding on species responses to environmental change. Hence, model predictions from JSDMs accounting for traits, environmental niches and potential interactions among multiple species can provide relevant simulations and forecasts with the potential to inform spatial management and conservation efforts aiming to preserve biodiversity and its associated services vital for human well-being.

Glass eels with a mean body mass of 0.29 g were caught in three coastal streams of Denmark, and subsequently stocked at four densities (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 individuals m(-2)) in eight shallow, 200 m(2), open ponds. Recapture after 18 months ranged from 13% to 84% and was negatively correlated with stocking density. Likewise, growth (length and body mass) and body condition were negatively correlated with stocking density. The theoretical maximum biomass per stocked glass eel was 7.3 g at a density of 0.005 eels per m(-2) (one glass eel per pond), and the minimum was at a density of 3 glass eel m(-2) (600 glass eels per pond). The optimum eel biomass was 3.9 g m(-2) at a stocking density of & AP;1 glass eel m(-2), which probably represented the present production capacity (food) of these ponds.	[Pedersen, M.

You can't play with us: First-person ostracism affects infants' behavioral reactivity	CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access							SOCIAL EXCLUSION; ADOLESCENCE; CONSEQUENCES; CHILDHOOD; IMITATION	Ostracism negatively affects fundamental psychological needs, induces physiological and behavioral changes, and modulates the processing of social information in adults. Yet little is known about children and preverbal infants' responses to first-person experiences of ostracism. The current study aimed to explore the efficacy of a triadic ball-tossing game in manipulating social inclusion and ostracism with 13-month-old infants (N = 84; 44% males; mostly White; tested from 2019 to 2022) by developing an observational coding system. Infants' behaviors were recorded while participating in a ball-tossing game where they were either included or ostracized from the game. Ostracized, but not included, infants showed an increase in negative emotionality and involvement behaviors, thus suggesting that behavioral responses to being ostracized emerge early in life.

While many signaling molecules are produced as seemingly circumstantial byproducts of common biochemical reactions, there are a few second messenger signaling systems such as the ubiquitous cyclic di-GMP second messenger system that arise through the synthesis of dedicated multidomain enzymes triggered by multiple diverse external and internal signals. Being one of the most numerous and widespread signaling system in bacteria, cyclic di-GMP signaling contributes to adjust physiological and metabolic responses in all available ecological niches. Those niches range from deep-sea and hydrothermal springs to the intracellular environment in human immune cells such as macrophages. This outmost adaptability is possible by the modularity of the cyclic di-GMP turnover proteins which enables coupling of enzymatic activity to the diversity of sensory domains and the flexibility in cyclic di-GMP binding sites. Nevertheless, commonly regulated fundamental microbial behavior include biofilm formation, motility, and acute and chronic virulence. The dedicated domains carrying out the enzymatic activity indicate an early evolutionary origin and diversification of "bona fide" second messengers such as cyclic di-GMP which is estimated to have been present in the last universal common ancestor of archaea and bacteria and maintained in the bacterial kingdom until today. This perspective article addresses aspects of our current view on the cyclic di-GMP signaling system and points to knowledge gaps that still await answers.

With the aid of the error compensation mechanism, command filter-based adaptive neural control is proposed for robotic systems driven by permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). An auxiliary signal produced by the first-order linear system designed by the property of unmodeled dynamics is used to erase the dynamical uncertainties. The input saturation of system is estimated by tanh$$ \tanh $$-function with mathematical transformation. Using barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), each component constraint of output is tackled. During the virtual control design phase, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) may reliably assess the unknown nonlinear continuous function. All the variables in the closed-loop system are proved to be semiglobally uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) by integrating all compensation signals into the overall Lyapunov function and using the defined compact set in the stability analysis of dynamic surface control (DSC). An applied example on robotic system is used to verify the effectiveness of the constructed design idea.

We find that differences in the fund alphas are statistically significant only in groups based on age, tenure, and professional qualifications (i.e., chartered financial analyst [CFA]). We also find a significant positive relation for age and CFA certification with a fund's risk-adjusted performance and a significant negative relation for tenure. However, we find no significant effect for gender and advanced education (i.e., master of business administration [MBA]). The differences in risk taking are significantly related only with age and tenure; the former has a negative and the latter a positive relation with risk taking.

Yet little empirical evidence has been provided for this mediating pathway. This study used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort of 2010-2011 (n = 11,421) to examine the associations between early childhood exposure to spanking and parental verbal aggression and subsequent academic achievement. We also investigated the mechanism for these associations by exploring the mediating role of executive function within those associations. Findings revealed that spanking and parental verbal aggression in kindergarten and first grade were negatively associated with reading and math scores in fifth grade, controlling for demographics and initial academic performance. Executive function (i.e., inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and working memory) accounted for more than half (50%-57%) and more than one fourth (24%-31%) of the total effects of spanking and verbal aggression on academic achievement, respectively. Findings provide important evidence for early intervention programs aiming to promote children's academic achievement and executive function by interfering or preventing harsh discipline.

Integral equations established are based on the frequency-independent fundamental solutions, which can avoid nonlinear eigenvalue problems and reduce computing time. Domain integral terms arising from the use of frequency-independent fundamental solutions are handled with the radial integration method (RIM) and dual reciprocity method (DRM), respectively. The results show the lower precision in high frequency domain of using RIM to handle domain integral terms than that of using DRM, which can be solved by increasing Gauss point. The B-spline wavelet on the interval and wavelet coefficients are applied to approximate the physical boundary conditions. It is proved that coupling conditions between matrix and scatterers and Bloch theorem are also applicable to wavelet coefficients. Some small matrix entries generated by wavelet vanishing moment characteristics are truncated by the provided matrix compression technique, and the influence of compressed matrices on the results is studied. Furthermore, the final Eigen equations constructed are modified to avoid numerical instability. Some examples are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

ObjectivesTo establish an efficient and feasible strategy for screening COX-2 inhibitors from triterpenoid saponins (TPSs) in Clematis tangutica. MethodsTaking TPSs in C. tangutica as example, an optimized macroporous resin (MR) method was established for the enrichment of TPSs. High-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOFMS) was performed to establish the phytochemical profiling of TPSs. Molecular docking was performed to predict the ligand-target interactions and discover the active substances. Chemometric techniques were performed to visualize the structure-effect relationships. High-speed countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC were performed to prepare the targets. In vitro activity experiment of COX-2 was performed to verify the virtual screening results. ResultsTPSs in C. tangutica were well enriched with the recovery rate of (80.22 & PLUSMN; 2.37)%. Thirty-four kinds of TPSs of oleanane type were deduced by HPLC-QTOFMS. Five TPSs of clematangoside C, clematangoside D, clematangoticoside J, hederoside H-1, and hederasaponin B showed stronger binding abilities with COX-2. The structure with more sugar groups at C-28 may be more conducive to the combination with COX-2. Targets were prepared with purities all above 98%. The IC50 values of target TPSs were 6.03 & PLUSMN; 0.24, 12.44 & PLUSMN; 0.15, 9.36 & PLUSMN; 0.19, 4.78 & PLUSMN; 0.13, and 2.59 & PLUSMN; 0.11 & mu;mol/L, respectively. ConclusionThe integrated strategy using MR, HPLC-QTOFMS, molecular docking, chemometrics, target preparation, and in vitro verification was feasible for rapidly screening COX-2 inhibitors from TPSs in C. tangutica.

It has been extensively studied at the individual molecule level, but not as much as ensembles in 3D. Here, the feasibility of implementing logic gates, the basic computation operations, in large ensembles: macroscopic, engineered 3D DNA crystals is demonstrated. The building blocks are the recently developed DNA double crossover-like (DXL) motifs. They can associate with each other via sticky-end cohesion. Common logic gates are realized by encoding the inputs within the sticky ends of the motifs. The outputs are demonstrated through the formation of macroscopic crystals that can be easily observed. This study points to a new direction of construction of complex 3D crystal architectures and DNA-based biosensors with easy readouts.

Little data is currently available on its safety in pregnancy. The aim of this study was to assess the fetal and pregnancy safety associated with prazosin exposures in early pregnancy. MethodsSubjects were 11 patients who took prazosin during pregnancy and were counselled at the FRAME clinic in London Health Sciences Centre (Ontario, Canada) between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2021. Data on their other exposures and pregnancy outcomes were collected from medical records and through telephone questionnaires. ResultsIt was found that 6/11 (54.5%) subjects did not report any adverse outcomes and experienced uneventful pregnancies. There were two miscarriages. Birthweights were within the normal range for the remaining nine pregnancies. Adverse events reported were consistent with background population expectation, including: one postpartum haemorrhage, one case of preeclampsia, one preterm birth, two NICU admissions, and two caesarean sections. ConclusionsFor these 11 subjects, pregnancy outcomes after exposure to prazosin were consistent with typical outcomes from unexposed pregnancies. More data are needed to conclude that prazosin is safe for use in pregnant subjects. However, the lack of adverse effects above baseline is reassuring to future patients who may be unintentionally exposed to prazosin while pregnant. Therefore, this study contributes valuable data towards monitoring safety of prazosin in pregnancy.	[Zitoun, Natalie; Campbell, M.

Herein, a biomimetic peptide to maintain quiescence of stem cells through C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8)-C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) pathway against intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is developed. First, it is confirmed that quiescence can be induced via inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in nucleus pulposus stem cells (NPSCs). Meanwhile, it is well known that CXCR1, a chemokine receptor, can be targeted by CXCL8, resulting in cell proliferation via activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Second, a biomimetic peptide (OAFF) that can bind to CXCR1 and form fibrous networks on NPSCs, mimicking extracellular matrix formation is developed. The multivalent effect and long-term binding to CXCR1 on NPSCs of OAFF fibers offer forcefully competitive inhibition with natural CXCL8, which induces NPSCs quiescence and ultimately overcomes obstacle in intradiscal injection therapy. In rat caudal disc puncture model, OAFF nanofibers still maintain at 5 weeks after operation and inhibit degeneration process of intervertebral disc in terms of histopathology and imageology. In situ fibrillogenesis of biomimetic peptide on NPSCs provides promising stem cells for intradiscal injection therapy against IVDD.

Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected wounds activates strong inflammatory responses. The overuse of antibiotics has led to increasing bacterial resistance. Therefore, effective ROS scavenging and bactericidal capacity are essential and the advanced development of collaborative therapeutic techniques to combat bacterial infections is needed. Here, this work developes an MXene@polydopamine-cryptotanshinone (MXene@PDA-CPT) antibacterial nanosystem with excellent reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging ability, which effectively inactivates drug-resistant bacteria and biofilms, thereby promoting wound healing. In this system, the adhesion of polydopamine nanoparticles to MXene produced a photothermal synergistic effect and free radical scavenging activity, presenting a promising antibacterial and anti-inflammatory strategy. This nanosystem causes fatal damage to bacterial membranes. The loading of cryptotanshinone further expanded the advantages of the system, causing a stronger bacterial killing effect and inflammation mitigatory effect with desired biosafety and biocompatibility. In addition, combining nanomaterials and active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine, this work provides a new rationale for the future development of wound dressings, which contributes to eliminating bacterial resistance, delaying disease deterioration, and alleviating the pain of patients.

We and other groups have shown that GFI1 has a dose-dependent role in the initiation, progression, and prognosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients by inducing epigenetic changes. We now demonstrate a novel role for dose-dependent GFI1 expression in regulating metabolism in haematopoietic progenitor and leukaemic cells. Using in-vitro and ex-vivo murine models of MLL::AF9-induced human AML and extra-cellular flux assays, we now demonstrate that a lower GFI1 expression enhances oxidative phosphorylation rate via upregulation of the FOXO1- MYC axis. Our findings underscore the significance of therapeutic exploitation in GFI1-low-expressing leukaemia cells by targeting oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism.

Efforts are made to understand the kinetics and evolution of biopolymer self-assembly upon cooling, but information is lacking on whether quenching might affect the final hydrogel structure and performance. Here, a material strategy for the fine modulation of quenching that involves temperature-curing steps of agarose is reported. Combining microscopy techniques, standard and advanced macro/nanomechanical tools, it is revealed that agarose accumulates on the surface when the curing temperature is set at 121 & DEG;C. The inhomogeneity can be mostly recovered when it is reduced to 42 & DEG;C. This has a drastic effect on the stiffness of the surface, but not on the viscoelasticity, roughness, and wettability. When hydrogels are strained at small/large deformations, the curing temperature has no effect on the viscoelastic response of the hydrogel bulk but does play a role in the onset of the non-linear region. Cells cultured on these hydrogels exhibit surface stiffness-sensing that affects cell adhesion, spreading, F-actin fiber tension, and assembly of vinculin-rich focal adhesions. Collectively, the results indicate that the temperature curing of agarose is an efficient strategy to produce networks with tunable mechanics and is suitable for mechanobiology studies.

Indwelling prosthetic voice restoration provides optimal outcomes; however, the long-term maintenance of these devices carries considerable financial costs, which are not universally covered by insurance. This investigation aimed to analyze associations between socioeconomic factors and outcomes in postlaryngectomy speech rehabilitation. Study DesignRetrospective cohort analysis. SettingAcademic tertiary-care center from May 2014 to September 2021. MethodsIn patients undergoing total laryngectomy, the incidence of tracheoesophageal puncture with indwelling vocal prostheses (TEP-VP) placement within the first postoperative year was compared among household income, demographic factors, and disease characteristics. Functional and maintenance outcomes served as secondary endpoints. ResultsSeventy-seven patients were included. Forty-five (58%) underwent indwelling TEP-VP (41 primaries). Eighty-nine percent of patients with annual incomes greater than $50k underwent TEP-VP compared to only 35% with incomes less than $50k/year. TEP-VP was performed in 85% of patients with commercial insurance, 70% with Medicare, 42% with Medicaid, and 0% with no insurance. On multivariate analysis, annual household incomes greater than $50k were predicted for TEP-VP placement (odds ratio: 12.7 [2.45-65.8], p = .002). The utilization of postoperative speech therapy and functional communication outcomes were similar among socioeconomic groups. Twelve patients were unable to afford supplies within the first year, with differences noted among insurance (p = .015) and income status (p = .003). ConclusionDisparities in vocal and speech rehabilitation following laryngectomy may disproportionally affect underserved patients.

J	Stevens, D				Stevens, David			Recasting "Fundamental 'British' Values": Education, Justice, and Preventing Violent Extremism	EDUCATIONAL THEORY			English	Article						violent extremism; sense of justice; moral education; John Rawls		Societies concerned with preventing acts of violent extremism often target the ideas that are thought to motivate such acts. The state's use of educational institutions is one mechanism by which those ideas are subjected to challenge. Teaching liberal democratic values to students is one method. Here, David Stevens argues that this model is misguided. First, commitment to violent methods is not primarily driven by the attractiveness of radical ideas themselves, but by material facts and circumstances. Second, an education that ignores the teaching of various socioeconomic values, such as a commitment to a certain degree of material equality and welfare provision, is inadequate as a conception of citizenship. These criticisms are related. Citizens are owed certain resources and commitments as citizens, and grounds for dissatisfaction and violence are reduced when citizens receive the holdings to which they are entitled, and when their fellow citizens recognize and endorse this. Consequently, it is the role of education to teach directively toward the adoption of such socioeconomic values and commitments.

The results reveal that the yield strength and tensile strength of the steel are enhanced with Mo addition at the equalization temperature of 480 & DEG;C at a cooling rate of 25 & DEG;C s(-1), accompanied by the improvement in the yield ratio. However, when the postrolling cooling temperature is reduced to 380 & DEG;C, the mechanical properties of steels with Mo-free and 0.29 wt% Mo are comparable. The mechanistic study indicates that the Mo addition would inhibit the transformation from deformed austenite to polygonal ferrite, and promote the transformation of acicular ferrite/granular bainite at medium-low temperatures, as well as significant differences in the volume fraction, size, and morphology of martensite/austenite (M/A) in the matrix. Notably, the volume fraction of M/A decreases from 7.2% to less than 1.0% with Mo content increasing, while its average size also reduces from 1.5 to less than 1.0 & mu;m. And the fine, spheroidal, and dispersed M/A is found to play a vital role in the high-strength and excellent low-temperature toughness of the steel.

Related research in the near-infrared region is extensive, yet few studies have been reported in the mid-infrared (MIR) region. Herein, a systematic investigation of MIR NLPs is made for the first time. An approach is presented by exploiting a polarization-maintaining fluoride fiber in the mode-locked oscillator to cause a polarization-dependent delay between the orthogonal-polarized components of intracavity circulating pulses, thus generating a series of ultrashort pulses which will eventually form a stable wave packet, namely, NLP. Numerical simulations based on the extended coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations predict the generation of NLPs, and reveal key aspects of the pulse evolution. Experiments yield linearly polarized NLPs at 2.8 & mu;m with a maximum average power of 498 mW and a spike width of 4.3 ps, corresponding to a pulse energy of 12 nJ. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results. This work constitutes a major step toward the development of MIR ultrafast fiber lasers with NLPs output.

The-state-of-the-art double-vector-based MPTC (DVMPTC) was proposed to improve steady-state performance. However, its duty cycle optimization method significantly affects the control performances. Thus, MPTC with hybrid mode duty cycle optimization is proposed, which realizes better performance than the universal DVMPTC, and obtains the appropriate average switching frequency, especially at high-speed domain. The proposed method utilises the universal DVMPTC method, while it equips duty cycle optimization with discrete space vector modulation (DSVM) scheme as the additional constraint for further reducing the reference voltage tracking error that exists in DVMPTC. What's more, rotation module and pre-selection strategies are involved in simplifying the design of vector selection methods. Comparative simulations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A unique feature of China's financial system is that commercial banks are not only long-term loan providers but also dominant bond investors. Thus, the loan prime rate (LPR) is an opportunity cost for commercial banks' bond holdings. However, the LPR is largely determined by the central bank and often deviates significantly from equilibrium. In contrast, the swap rate is largely determined by the market. Our illustrative model and empirical evidence show that the LPR and funding availability affect bond yields more than swap rates, while volatility in the money market interest rate affects swap rates more than bond yields. Therefore, the swap spread is largely driven by the monetary policy. We also show that swap spreads can be a predictor of excess returns on bonds but not swaps.

However, TC prediction at subseasonal timescale (i.e., 1-4 weeks in advance) is not being researched for that region despite growing demands from decision makers at sectoral level. In this paper, we first assess the feasibility of developing subseasonal prediction frameworks for the SI region using a pool of predictors that are known to affect TC activity in the region. We then evaluate multiple predictor combinations to develop the most appropriate models using a statistical approach to forecast weekly TC activity up to 4 weeks in advance. Predictors used include indices of various natural climate variability modes, namely the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). These modes often have robust physical and statistical relationships with TC occurrences in the SI region and the broader southwest Pacific territory as shown by preceding studies. Additionally, we incorporate TC seasonality as a potential predictor given the persistence of TCs occurring more in certain months than others. Note that a model with seasonality predictor alone (hereafter called the "climatology" model) forms a baseline for comparisons. The hindcast verifications of the forecasts using leave-one-out cross-validation procedure over the study period 1975-2019 indicate considerable improvements in prediction skill of our logistic regression models over climatology, even up to 4 weeks in advance. This study sets the foundation for introducing subseasonal prediction services, which is a national priority for improved decision making in sectors like agriculture and food security, water, health and disaster risk mitigation in the Solomon Islands.

Elucidation of the specific mechanisms underlying radioresistance is necessary to improve the clinical efficacy of radiation therapy. To identify the key factors contributing to radioresistance, five melanoma cell lines were selected for study and genes that were upregulated in relatively radioresistant melanomas compared with radiosensitive melanoma cells determined via RNA sequencing technology. In particular, we focused on cyclin D1 (CCND1), a well known cell cycle regulatory molecule. In radiosensitive melanoma, overexpression of cyclin D1 reduced apoptosis. In radioresistant melanoma cell lines, suppression of cyclin D1 with a specific inhibitor or siRNA increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation in 2D and 3D spheroid cultures. In addition, we observed increased expression of ?-H2AX, a molecular marker of DNA damage, even at a later time after ?-irradiation, under conditions of inhibition of cyclin D1, with a response pattern similar to that of radiosensitive SK-Mel5. In the same context, expression and nuclear foci formation of RAD51, a key enzyme for homologous recombination (HR), were reduced upon inhibition of cyclin D1. Downregulation of RAD51 also reduced cell survival to irradiation. Overall, suppression of cyclin D1 expression or function led to reduced radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) and triggered cell death. Our collective findings indicate that the presence of increased cyclin D1 potentially contributes to the development of radioresistance through effects on RAD51 in melanoma and could therefore serve as a therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of radiation therapy.

Methods and resultsThe study included 1691 consecutive patients with HFmrEF (mean 68.2 years, 64.8% male) including 296 AF patients. Patients completed 1 year and mean of 33 month clinical follow-up after discharge by telephone interview, clinical visit, or community visit. The primary endpoint was cerebro-cardiovascular events (CCE, composite of HF rehospitalization, stroke, or cardiovascular death). After propensity score matching, 296 patients were included into the AF group (mean 71.5 years) and 592 patients into the non-AF group (mean 70.6 years). After propensity score matching, CCE at 1 year (59.1% vs. 48.5%, P = 0.003) and at a mean of 33 month (77.0% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.043). AF was independently associated with increased CCE within 1 year (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.61, P = 0.010) and at 33 months (HR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.43, P = 0.050) post-discharge after adjusted for other clinical confounders including discharge heart rate, NT-proBNP, haemoglobin, and uric acid. ConclusionsAF is independently associated with an increased risk of CCE in HFmrEF patients within 1 year and at a mean of 33 months after discharge.

Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multilayered skin structure and the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, a theoretical framework is established for analyzing the impedances of multilayered tissues and, in particular, of skin. Then, strategies are determined for the system-level design of electrodes and electronics, which minimize 4-wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in the presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non-invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, non-invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues are demonstrated in the presence of parasitic impedances which are much (e.g., up to 350 times) higher than the bioimpedances of the living tissues beyond the stratum corneum, independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin-electrode contact impedances (sweat). The results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems for the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues in several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and multipotent adult stem cells.

However, the conventional EV therapy strategy displays some limitations, such as inefficient EV production and lack of tissue-specific repair effects. Here, it is reported that neonatal-tissue-derived EV therapy (NEXT) is a potent strategy for precision tissue repair. In brief, large amounts of EVs with higher yield/purity can be readily isolated from desired tissues with less production time/cost compared to the conventional cell-culture-based method. Moreover, source factors, such as age and tissue type, can affect the repair efficacy of such tissue-derived EVs in different tissue injury models (skin wounds and acute kidney injury), and neonatal-tissue-derived EVs show superior tissue repair potency compared with adult-tissue-derived EVs. Different age- or tissue-type-derived EVs have distinct composition (e.g., protein) signatures that are likely due to the diverse metabolic patterns of the donor tissues, which may contribute to the specific repair action modes of NEXT in different types of tissue injury. Furthermore, neonatal-tissue-derived EVs can be incorporated with bioactive materials for advanced tissue repair. This study highlights that the NEXT strategy may provide a new avenue for precision tissue repair in many types of tissue injury.

However, no study has quantified the rate or ways that support groups utilize genetic counselors. This study surveyed one person in a leadership role at genetic support organizations to determine how many of the organizations have a relationship with genetic counselors, their utilization of genetic counselors, and their satisfaction with that relationship. It was found that 64.8% of organizations had a relationship with genetic counselors. Relationships were more likely to exist when organizations had full-time workers, had a primary focus on research, or offered a number and variety of services to members. Ways in which organizations utilized genetic counselors included as speakers at conferences, answering patient inquiries, and serving on expert panels. These relationships were supported through funding, networking, and patients connecting the two parties. Overall, representatives from organizations that had a relationship of any sort with genetic counselors were more likely to indicate satisfaction with that relationship than dissatisfaction (& chi;(2)(4, n = 89) = 45.053, p < 0.001). Even so, many respondents indicated that they wanted to continue to grow their relationship with genetic counselors but were hindered by the lack of funding or access to genetic counselors who could be engaged in their cause. Thus, while relationships and satisfaction with the relationship to genetic counselors were generally high, this study highlights access, outreach, and funding as areas of focus to improve utilization of genetic counselors in the support group sector.

A sequence X=(x1,x2, ...,x(N)) of points in the unit interval [0,1) is piercing if {x1,x2,...,xn}boolean AND[i/n,i+1/n) not equal(sic) holds for every n=1,2, ...,N and every i=0,1, ...,n-1. In 1958, Steinhaus asked whether piercing sequences can be arbitrarily long. A negative answer was provided by Schinzel, who proved that any such sequence may have at most 74 elements. This was later improved to the best possible value of 17 by Warmus, and independently by Berlekamp and Graham. In this paper, we study a more general variant of piercing sequences. Let f(n)>= n be an infinite nondecreasing sequence of positive integers. A sequence X=(x1,x2,...,x(f(N))) is f-piercing if {x1,x2, ...xf(n)}boolean AND[i/n,i+1/n)not equal circle divide holds for every n=1,2, ...,N and every i=0,1, ... ,n-1. A special case of f(n)=n+d, with d a fixed nonnegative integer, was studied by Berlekamp and Graham. They noticed that for each d >= 0, the maximum length of any (n+d)-piercing sequence is finite. Expressing this maximum length as s(d)+d, they obtained an exponential upper bound on the function s(d), which was later improved to s(d)=O(d3) by Graham and Levy. Recently, Konyagin proved that 2d <= s(d)<200d holds for all sufficiently big d. Using a different technique based on the Farey fractions and stick-breaking games, we prove here that the function s(d) satisfies [c1d]<= s(d)<=;c2d+o(d) where c1=ln2/1-ln2 approximate to 2.25 and c2=1+ln2/1-ln2 approximate to 5.52. We also prove that there exists an infinite f-piercing sequence with f(n)=gamma n+o(n) if and only if gamma >= 1ln2 approximate to 1.44.

Catalytic ozonation has emerged as a promising technique for the treatment of pulp and paper industry wastewater. Numerous reviews have presented the research on catalytic ozonation; however, open literature is missing a bibliometric analysis. Therefore, this article presents a bibliometric analysis of the research available on catalytic ozonation in pulp and paper industry wastewater treatment. A total of 578 documents extracted from the Scopus database have been examined via VOSviewer, MS Excel, and Rstudio to identify the research trends, influential authors, and research institutions in the field. The results reveal that the number of publications on the topic has increased significantly in recent years. This study also identified several influential authors, institutions, and highlighted future research directions in the field. Overall, the study provides insights into the state of research on catalytic ozonation in pulp and paper industry wastewater treatment and could help guide future research efforts in this area.

We sampled their occurrence following different sampling strategies: random, stratified, systematic, topographic, uniform within the environmental space (hereafter, uniform) and close to roads. For each sampling design and species, we ran 500 simulations at increasing sampling efforts (total: 42,000 replicates). For each replicate, we fitted a binomial generalised linear model, extracted model coefficients for precipitation and temperature, and compared them with true coefficients from the known species' equation. We evaluated the quality of the estimated response curves by computing bias, variance and root mean squared error (RMSE). Additionally, we (i) assessed the impact of missing covariates on the performance of the sampling approaches and (ii) evaluated the effect of incompletely sampling the environmental space on the uniform approach.Results: For the generalist species, we found the lowest RMSE when uniformly sampling the environmental space, while sampling occurrence data close to roads provided the worst performance. For the specialist species, all sampling designs showed comparable outcomes. Excluding important predictors similarly affected all sampling strategies. Sampling limited portions of the environmental space reduced the performance of the uniform approach, regardless of the portion surveyed.Main Conclusions: Our results suggest that a proper estimate of the species response curve can be obtained when the choice of the sampling strategy is guided by the species' ecology. Overall, uniformly sampling the environmental space seems more efficient for species with wide environmental tolerances. The advantage of seeking the most appropriate sampling strategy vanishes when modelling species with narrow realised niches.

J	Bu, KQ; Liu, Y; Wang, FL				Bu, Kaiqing; Liu, Yan; Wang, Fuli			Process operation performance assessment of electro-fused magnesium furnace based on deep auto-encoder transfer generative adversarial network	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						electro-fused magnesium furnace; generate adversarial network; multi-source heterogeneous information; process operation performance assessment; transfer learning	LSTM; CNN; AUTOENCODER; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; MODEL	The process operation performance assessment (POPA) of the smelting process of electro-fused magnesium furnaces (EFMFs) plays a very important role for improving production quality and pursuing the highest economic benefit. Most of the existing methods are based on the assumption of abundant labelled training samples. However, the lack of samples for the POPA is a challenging problem in the smelting process of EFMFs. Traditional methods for POPA make it difficult to obtain satisfactory results under small samples. A new deep auto-encoder transfer generative adversarial network (DAETGAN) based on source domain data is proposed to improve the performance of POPA with small samples in EFMF smelting process. Firstly, a general transfer framework is proposed, in which the data of source domain is used as input to generate adversarial network (GAN), and a large number of images, sound, and current samples are generated with the same distribution as the data of target domain so as to improve the transfer learning effect. Secondly, a POPA model is proposed with the multi-source heterogeneous information generated by DAETGAN and the original multi-source heterogeneous information in target domain. Finally, it is verified by experiments that the DAETGAN model can generate data with the same distribution as the original data, and the accuracy of the assessment of operational performance is effectively improved.

However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X-ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu-5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773 K, even in the presence of 0.15 mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion-corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O-2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude "breathing" motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation states of the Cu-5-oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano-structured chemistry of Cu.

Due to increased bacterial resistance caused by improper and excessive use of antibiotics, antibacterial biomaterials are being developed as alternatives to antibiotics in some cases. Herein, an advanced multifunctional hydrogel with excellent antibacterial properties, enhanced mechanical properties, biocompatibility and self-healing performance, was designed through freezing-thawing method. This hydrogel network is composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), protocatechualdehyde (PA), ferric iron (Fe) and an antimicrobial cyclic peptide actinomycin X2 (Ac.X2). The double dynamic bonds among protocatechualdehyde (PA), ferric iron (Fe) and carboxymethyl chitosan containing coordinate bond (catechol-Fe) as well as dynamic Schiff base bonds and hydrogen bonds endowed the hydrogel with enhanced mechanical properties. Successful formation of hydrogel was confirmed through ATR-IR and XRD, and structural evaluation through SEM analysis, whereas mechanical properties were tested with electromechanical universal testing machine. The resulting PVA/CMCS/Ac.X2/PA@Fe (PCXPA) hydrogel has favorable biocompatibility and excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both S. aureus (95.3 %) and E. coli (90.2 %) compared with free-soluble Ac.X2, which exhibited subpar performance against E. coli reported in our previous studies. This work provides a new insight on preparing multifunctional hydrogels containing antimicrobial peptides as antibacterial material.

The oxidization mechanism for PDEB to EAP over Ce/Cu-BTC was investigated. Results show Ce/Cu-BTC is a mischcrystal mixture of Ce-BTC and Cu-BTC, the addition of Ce can increase the crystal phase defects and enlarge the pore size of Cu-BTC. The conversion rate of PDEB is above 95 % and the yield of EAP are stable at 75 % in the Ce/Cu-BTC fixed bed reactor. A mixture of EAP, 1-(4-ethylphenyl)-1-ethanol (EPEA) and p-diacetylbenzene (PDAB) can be detected in the outlet of the reactor. The PDEB with Ce4+/Cu2+, H2O2 and bromine free radical generate EPEA and EAP, the EAP is then further oxidized to PDAB. The mischcrystal structure of Ce/Cu-BTC is beneficial to improve the catalytic oxidation activity and reaction rate of PDEB to EAP.

Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at The Ottawa Hospital using electronic medical records. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of RMEC between 2000 and 2019, endometrioid histology, and >= one line of progestin treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Of 2342 cases reviewed, 74 met inclusion criteria. Sixty-six (88.0%) patients received megestrol acetate and 9 (12.0%) received a progestin alternative. The distribution of tumors by grade was: 1: 25 (33.3%), 2: 30 (40.0%), and 3: 20 (26.7%). The PFS and OS for the entire study sample was 14.3 months (95% CI 6.2-17.9) and 23.3 months (14.8-36.8), respectively. The PFS for patients with Grade 1-2 RMEC was 15.7 months (8.0, 19.5), compared to 5.0 months (3.0, 23.0) with Grade 3 disease. The OS for patients with Grade 1-2 versus Grade 3, was 25.9 months (15.3, 40.3) versus 12.5 months (5.7, 35.9), respectively. Thirty-four (45.9%) and 40 (54.1%) patients were treated with 0 and >= 1 line of chemotherapy. The PFS for chemotherapy-naive patients was 17.9 months (14.3, 27.0), versus 6.2 months (3.9, 14.8) following >= 1 line of treatment. The OS was 29.1 months (17.9, 61.1) for chemotherapy-naive patients versus 23.0 months (10.5, 37.6) for patients previously exposed. Conclusions: This real-world data on RMEC suggests there is a role for progestins in select subgroups of women. The PFS for chemotherapy-naive patients was 17.9 months (14.3, 27.0), versus 6.2 months (3.9, 14.8) following >= 1 line of treatment. The OS was 29.1 months (17.9, 61.1) for chemotherapy-OS was 29.1 months (17.9, 61.1) for chemotherapy-naive patients versus 23.0 months (10.5, 37.6) for patients previously exposed.

J	Liu, YJ; Man, WM; Zhou, TJ				Liu, Yujia; Man, Wenmin; Zhou, Tianjun			Interpreting precipitation δ<SUP>18</SUP>O over eastern China for the Asian summer monsoon: Results from the last millennium simulations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						East Asian summer monsoon; east China; Indian summer monsoon; precipitation oxygen isotopes; speleothem calcite records	INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE; ATMOSPHERIC CONTROLS; ENSO VARIABILITY; TIBETAN PLATEAU; NORTHERN CHINA; CAVE RECORDS; DELTA-O-18; CIRCULATION; RAINFALL	The Asian summer monsoon (ASM) plays a major role in the Asian climate system, affecting nearly half of the world's population. The oxygen isotopes of speleothem calcite (d(18)O(c)) records in China provide important insights into past ASM changes; however, it remains controversial whether the d(18)O(c) records over eastern China (EC) mainly reflect the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) or East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). In this study, we estimate the relationships between precipitation-weighted oxygen isotopes (d(18)O(pw)) and various ASM indices over the last millennium based on the isotope-enabled Community Earth System Model. The d(18)O(pw) in EC mainly characterizes the intensity of the ISM and, to some extent, reflects the meridional wind component of the EASM, but it has an opposite relationship with the zonal wind component of the EASM. Although the limitations of various EASM definitions lead to the contrary relations between the d(18)O(pw) and EASM indices, the d(18)O(pw) in EC is accompanied by consistent EASM footprints. Moreover, although the meridional wind-based EASM indices are negatively correlated with d(18)O(pw) over EC, the relationships are much weaker than that with the ISM indices. The widespread negative d(18)O(pw) signals extending from the Indian Peninsula to East Asia are closely coupled with the low-level circulation over the ISM region. When considering the relationship between the EASM and d(18)O(pw) over EC, the positive contribution from the Northwest Pacific offset the negative contribution from the remote Indian Ocean, leading to the insignificant correlation between the EASM indices and d(18)O(pw) over EC.

The C(sp(2))-H (ortho) functionalizations including arylation, bromination, iodination, and alkoxylation were attempted. The C(sp(2))-H (ortho) arylation reactions gave biaryl or terphenyl-type beta-phenylalanine scaffolds, halogenation and methoxylation reactions gave ortho C-H halogenated or methoxylated beta-phenylalanines. Additionally, the C-H arylation of an ortho-methyl substituted beta-phenylalanine containing both C(sp(2))-H and remote C(sp(3))-H bonds was investigated. beta-Phenylalanine is an arylated beta-amino acid motif present in various natural products, bioactive molecules, and beta-peptides and it is a precursor to medicinally active compounds. Accordingly, this work contributes to the expansion of the library of unnatural beta-phenylalanine (beta-amino acid) derivatives through site-selective C-H functionalization.

Its conservation through semen cryopreservation with sufficient live sperm recovery rate is requisite where ascorbic acid could play significant role to mitigate cryo-incited injuries. The objective was to elucidate the effect of ascorbic acid on freezability of Indian red jungle fowl sperm. Pooled semen was aliquoted and diluted (1:5) with red fowl extender having ascorbic acid: 0.0 (control), 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mM. Diluted samples were cryopreserved and semen quality was assessed at post-dilution, cooling, equilibration and freeze-thawing stages. Sperm metabolic status, antioxidant potential and lipid peroxidation were studied at post-dilution and freeze-thawing. Sperm motility did not differ (p > .05) in experimental extenders and control at post-dilution and cooling; however, it was recorded higher (p < .05) with ascorbic acid at 2.0 mM compared with other levels at post-equilibration and post-thawing stage. Sperm viability, plasma membrane and acrosome intactness were recorded higher (p < .05) with 2.0 mM ascorbic acid compared with other concentrations of ascorbic acid at all stages of cryopreservation. Sperm metabolic status and antioxidant potential were recorded higher (p < .05), while lipid peroxidation was recorded lowest (p < .05) with 2.0 mM ascorbic acid compared with 1.0, 4.0 mM and control. In conclusion, ascorbic acid at 2.0 mM in red fowl extender improves quality, metabolic status and antioxidant potential of frozen Indian red jungle fowl semen through ameliorating lipid peroxidation.

It is most highly expressed in the brain where it plays a role in synaptogenesis and synapse maintenance. Genome-wide association studies have implicated ADGRB3 in disorders such as schizophrenia and epilepsy. Somatic mutations in ADGRB3 have also been identified in cancer. To better understand the in vivo physiological role of ADGRB3, we used CRISPR/Cas9 editing to generate a mouse line with a 7-base pair deletion in Adgrb3 exon 10. Western blot analysis confirmed that homozygous mutants (Adgrb3( increment 7/ increment 7)) lack full-length ADGRB3 expression. The mutant mice were viable and reproduced in Mendelian ratios but demonstrated reduced brain and body weights and deficits in social interaction. Measurements of locomotor function, olfaction, anxiety levels and prepulse inhibition were comparable between heterozygous and homozygous mutants and wild-type littermates. Since ADGRB3 is also expressed in organs such as lung and pancreas, this new mouse model will facilitate elucidation of ADGRB3's role in non-central nervous system-related functions. Finally, since somatic mutations in ADGRB3 were identified in patients with several cancer types, these mice can be used to determine whether loss of ADGRB3 function contributes to tumour development.

In the present study effect of berberine on damage to the aorta wall induced by atherosclerosis in mice model was investigated. The results demonstrated that berberine treatment significantly (P<0.05) reverses the atherosclerosis-induced increase in the area of the lesions in the mice aortas. Berberine treatment at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg doses reduced lesion area in the aorta of atherosclerosis mice to 53.5 & PLUSMN;3.69, 39.4 & PLUSMN;3.69 and 13.8 & PLUSMN;2.12 %, respectively. Atherosclerosis-induced up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-1 & beta; and IL-6 production was down-regulated in mice aortas on treatment with berberine. Treatment with berberine downregulated the atherosclerosis-induced increase in expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-& alpha;, angiotensin II (AngII), Alveolar type 2 progenitor cells (AT1), and AT2 in mice aorta tissues. Moreover, berberine treatment of atherosclerosis mice led to a marked reduction in the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), p65, and p38 proteins. In summary, berberine treatment reverses damage associated with atherosclerosis in mice aorta walls by inhibiting the inflammatory response. It targets activation of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway and downregulated RAAS expression in atherosclerotic mice. Therefore, berberine may be developed as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for atherosclerosis treatment.	[Sun, Mmed. Junfeng; Gao, Mmed.

Here, we report a case of diffuse myocellulitis in the nasal planum without development of granulomas on its surface. A Jersey cow was presented with hypersalivation and a firm, painless, diffuse almost symmetrical swelling of the nasal planum with moderate hyperaemia. The cow was slaughtered and the head was examined. Histopathology of the nasal planum revealed widespread severe pyogranulomatous inflammation with clusters of bacteria and Splendore-Hoeppli material with extensive diffuse fibrosis and loss of muscle tissue. A. lignieresii was isolated in monoculture by bacteriology. The appearance of the condition differed from previously reported cases, as protruding granulomas were not present and the tissue reaction affected the entire nasal planum in a uniform way. Actinobacillosis should be considered in cases of firm enlargement of the nasal planum in cattle.

A chipless light switch for smart-homes	IET CIRCUITS DEVICES & SYSTEMS			English	Article						chipless RFID; industry 4; 0; intelligent sensors; Internet of Things; light switch	CMOS	The limited and inconvenient functionality of conventional light switches is out of pace with current advancements in wireless sensors. A chipless RFID light switch (CLS) that is passive, battery-free and relocatable and maintains the convenience of having physical buttons for controlling lightbulbs or other electrical devices is introduced. These characteristics have been achieved by attaching single-pole-single-through toggle switches to the edges of radio frequency spiral resonators. The status of the switches activates or deactivates the resonators, allowing the CLS tag to passively communicate the status of the switches. A CLS tag with two ID resonators (used for tag identifications), and two measurement resonators [MRs] (connected with switches and used to communicate the status of the switches) was designed and fabricated using a 1-mm-thick FR4 substrate. Measurement results showed resonant frequencies at 1115 and 1220 MHz corresponding to the ID resonators and frequencies at 848 and 971 MHz corresponding to the MRs. Turning the switches OFF and ON successfully activated and deactivated the MRs.

We show that weak solutions are locally bounded when the variable exponent p is only assumed to be continuous and bounded. Furthermore, we prove that bounded weak solutions are locally Holder continuous under some additional assumptions on p. On the one hand, the class of admissible exponents is assumed to satisfy a log-Holder-type condition inside the domain, which is essential even in the case of local equations. On the other hand, since we are concerned with nonlocal problems, we need an additional assumption on p outside the domain.

HSV-1 is a highly contagious and endemic virus. Available drugs are insufficient for recurrent HSV-1 infections. Therefore, new approaches to treat HSV-1 infections are still being developed. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the inhibition effect of ethanolic Anatolian propolis extracts obtained from the Eastern Black Sea Region (Pazar, Ardahan, and Uzungol) on HSV-1. In addition to the total phenolic (TPC) and the total flavonoid content (TFC), the phenolic profiles of the extracts were analyzed by HPLC-UV. The antiviral activity of the extracts were tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), and plaque reduction tests, and the results were evaluated statistically. It was determined that the total amount of phenolic substances varied between 44.12 and 166.91 mg GAE/g, and the total flavonoid content of the samples varied between 12.50 and 41.58 (mg QUE/g). It was shown that all propolis samples used in the current study were effective against HSV-1, but the higher phenolic compounds contained in the samples showed the higher activity. The results show that ethanolic propolis extracts are promising candidates for HSV-1 treatment.	[Cora, Merve; Buruk, C.

Electrically Conductive Liquid Metal Composite Adhesives for Reversible Bonding of Soft Electronics	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						adhesive; composites; elastomers; liquid metals; soft electronics	PRESSURE-SENSITIVE ADHESIVES; RHEOLOGY; HYDROGELS; NETWORKS	Conductive adhesives are required for the integration of dissimilar material components to create soft electronic and robotic systems. Here, a heterogeneous liquid metal-based conductive adhesive is developed that reversibly attaches to diverse surfaces with high stretchability (>100% strain), low modulus (<100 kPa), and strain-invariant electrical conductivity. This SofT integrated composite with tacK through liquid metal (STICK-LM) adhesive consists of a heterogeneous graded film with a liquid metal-rich side that is embossed at prescribed locations for electrical conductivity and an electrically insulating adhesive side for integration. Adhesion behavior is tuned for adhesion energies > 70 Jm(-)(2) (& AP; 25x enhancement over unmodified composites) and described with a viscoelastic analysis, providing design guidelines for controllable yet reversible adhesion in electrically conductive systems. The architecture of STICK-LM adhesives provides anisotropic and heterogeneous electrical conductivity and enables direct integration into soft functional systems. This is demonstrated with deformable fuses for robotic joints, repositionable electronics that rapidly attach on curvilinear surfaces, and stretchable adhesive conductors with nearly constant electrical resistance. This study provides a methodology for electrically conductive, reversible adhesives for electrical and mechanical integration of multicomponent systems in emerging technologies.	[Haque, A. B. M.

We use Bayesian inference to account for a large amount of uncertainty within intrinsic value estimation. We find that an undervalued-minus-overvalued factor that invests in cheap quality stocks and sells expensive junk stocks selected via Bayesian inference yields high risk-adjusted returns and Sharpe ratios for equal-weighted portfolios. We also find that using value-weighted portfolios introduces size-based dilutions and shifts the focus away from actual quality characteristics like profitability, payout, safety, and past growth. Our findings suggest that while the relative benefit of accounting for uncertainty via Bayesian inference is not large over shorter holding periods, it pays off for investment horizons longer than a month.

Affect variability and physical health: The moderating role of mean affect	APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING			English	Article; Early Access						affect; affect dynamics; affect variability; physical health	POSITIVE AFFECT; NEGATIVE AFFECT; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; EMOTION; CHILDREN; DISEASE; PAIN; SIZE	Research has only begun to explore how affect variability relates to physical health and has typically not assessed long-term associations nor considered the moderating role of mean affect. Therefore, we used data from the Midlife in the United States Study waves 2 (N = 1512) and 3 (N = 1499) to test how affect variability predicted concurrent and long-term physical health while also testing the moderating role of mean affect. Results indicated that greater negative affect variability was associated concurrently with a greater number of chronic conditions (p = .03) and longitudinally with worse self-rated physical health (p < .01). Greater positive affect variability was associated concurrently with more chronic conditions (p < .01) and medications (p < .01) and longitudinally with worse self-rated physical health (p = .04). Further, mean negative affect played a moderating role such that at lower levels of mean negative affect, as affect variability increased, so did the number of concurrent chronic conditions (p < .01) and medications (p = .03) and the likelihood of reporting worse long-term self-rated physical health (p < .01). Thus, the role of mean affect should be considered when testing short- and long-term associations between affect variability and physical health.	[Jenkins, Brooke N. N.; Ong, Lydia Q.

J	Kulagina, S; Meyerhenke, H; Benoit, A				Kulagina, Svetlana; Meyerhenke, Henning; Benoit, Anne			Mapping tree-shaped workflows on systems with different memory sizes and processor speeds	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						mapping; memory constraint; tree partitioning; workflows		Directed acyclic graphs are commonly used to model scientific workflows, by expressing dependencies between tasks, as well as the resource requirements of the workflow. As a special case, rooted directed trees occur in several applications, for instance in sparse matrix computations. Since typical workflows are modeled by large trees, it is crucial to schedule them efficiently, so that their execution time (or makespan) is minimized. Furthermore, it is usually beneficial to distribute the execution on several compute nodes, hence increasing the available memory, and allowing us to parallelize parts of the execution. To exploit the heterogeneity of modern clusters in this context, we investigate the partitioning and mapping of tree-shaped workflows on two types of target architecture models: in AM1, each processor can have a different memory size, and in AM2, each processor can also have a different speed (in addition to a different memory size). We design a three-step heuristic for AM1, which adapts and extends previous work for homogeneous clusters [Gou C, Benoit A, Marchal L. Partitioning tree-shaped task graphs for distributed platforms with limited memory. IEEE Trans Parallel Dist Syst 2020; 31(7): 1533-1544]. The changes we propose concern the assignment to processors (accounting for the different memory sizes) and the availability of suitable processors when splitting or merging subtrees. For AM2, we extend the heuristic for AM1 with a two-phase local search approach. Phase A is a swap-based hill climber, while (the optional) Phase B is inspired by iterated local search. We evaluate our heuristics for AM1 and AM2 with extensive simulations, and we demonstrate that exploiting the heterogeneity in the cluster significantly reduces the makespan, compared to the state of the art for homogeneous processors.

Cities and regions participate actively by hosting a stage start and/or finish, but it is unclear if there are place-based benefits from such local engagements. We estimate the direct and spatially indirect immediate regional benefits of hosting a TdF stage using monthly tourism data for French departements during 2011-2020. Our static and dynamic panel regressions indicate that hosting a TdF stage leads to significant increases in tourist arrivals and nights spent vis-a-vis similar departements not hosting a stage at the same time. Results are found to be robust when we run placebo tests, matching-based estimation to deal with regional heterogeneity and associated treatment endogeneity as well as spatially augmented estimations to account for interregional spillovers to departements not directly hosting a stage start/finish, for example, to those located along the route of a TdF stage. We use the obtained treatment estimates to discuss the regional economic impact of the TdF and their ramifications for tourism-based regional development and event management.

Research and scholarly methods: Studies of workplace well-being and other organizational phenomena	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CLINICAL PHARMACY			English	Article; Early Access						burnout; organizations; psychological theory; research design; surveys; work	JOB DEMANDS; RESOURCES; SCALE; RESILIENCE; VALIDATION	As research in pharmacy increasingly focuses on work-related topics such as burnout, workforce management, and diversity, equity, and inclusion, there is a growing need for scholars to understand and use organizational research methods. However, these skills are not typically taught in pharmacy schools or postgraduate training programs, posing a challenge to researchers and peer reviewers alike. To address this gap, we aim to provide a practical introduction to organizational research methods with a focus on deductive, quantitative approaches. Given the growing interest in studying pharmacists' workplace well-being, we use this as a theme for our review. We begin by discussing the importance of a thorough literature review and using theory to frame the research, develop study hypotheses, and select an appropriate research design. We also provide a list of example theories that researchers could use to study the topic of workplace well-being. Next, we discuss key considerations for defining and measuring organizational constructs, including validity and reliability, and highlight potential pitfalls to avoid in survey research. Using several phenomena of interest in studies of workplace well-being, we provide examples of construct definitions and illustrate how they could be operationalized as variables in a research study. Finally, we discuss important considerations for analyzing organizational data and describe skills that researchers should acquire or seek in potential collaborators. To aid researchers and peer reviewers, we provide a checklist summarizing our recommendations and references to additional resources. By equipping scholars with a better understanding of organizational research methods, we aim to enhance our understanding of pharmacists' work experiences and generate evidence to support workplace improvements that will benefit pharmacists and their efforts to provide patient care.

In both periods, d(13)C values show niche partitioning between hare, horse and mammoth on one side, and reindeer and ibex on the other, indicating different diets and habitats between both herbivore groups. The d(15)N differences between carnivores and herbivores suggest a difference of one trophic level during the pre-Last Glacial Maximum (pre-LGM) period at the Early Gravettian sites and a tendency towards secondary carnivores during the LGM at Kammern-Grubgraben. d(15)N values of pre-LGM mammoths are elevated in relation to other herbivores but shifted to the level of other herbivores in the LGM. A general d(15)N value shift in herbivores of 3.3 & PTSTHOUSND; from the pre-LGM to the LGM is related to climatic deterioration. This may have led to the disappearance of certain ecological niches and to a shift from broader to overlapping ecological herbivore niches shortly before the LGM, as demonstrated by SIBER analyses.

J	Searby, A; James, R; Snipe, J; Maude, P				Searby, Adam; James, Russell; Snipe, Jim; Maude, Phil			Locked external doors on inpatient mental health units: A scoping review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH NURSING			English	Review; Early Access						absconding; aggression; locked unit; ward; mental health recovery; mental health services; psychiatric nursing	PSYCHIATRIC INTENSIVE-CARE; MIXED-METHODS; NURSES; STAFF; WARDS; LOCKING; POLICY	The principles of least restrictive care and recovery-focused practice are promoted as contemporary practice in the care of individuals with mental ill health, underpinning legislation concerning mental health and illness in many jurisdictions worldwide. Inpatient mental health units with locked doors are incompatible with this style of care and throwback to a time where care for mental illness was primarily custodial. The aim of this scoping review is to determine whether evidence exists for locking mental health unit doors, whether this practice is compatible with recovery-focused care and to determine whether door locking has changed since a review conducted by Van Der Merwe et al. (Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 16, 2009, 293) found that door locking was not the preferred practice in the management of acute mental health units. We used Arksey and O'Malley's (International Journal of Social Research Methodology: Theory and Practice, 8, 2005, 19) framework for scoping reviews, with our initial search locating 1377 studies, with screening narrowing final papers for inclusion to 20. Methodologies for papers included 12 using quantitative methodology, 5 qualitative and 3 that used mixed methods designs. Poor evidence was found for door locking to mitigate risks such as absconding, aggression or illicit substance importation. Furthermore, locked doors had a detrimental impact on the therapeutic relationship, nurse job satisfaction and intention to leave the profession. This scoping review indicates that research is urgently needed to address a mental healthcare culture where door locking is an entrenched practice. Studies of alternative approaches to risk management are required to ensure inpatient mental health units are truly least-restrictive, therapeutic environments.

We evaluated the validity of the short-form five-item Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID-5) questionnaire as a screening tool for depression, comparing it with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Materials and MethodsA total of 208 English-speaking adults with type 2 diabetes, recruited from outpatient clinics, completed the BDI-II, PHQ-9 and PAID-5 questionnaires in English. Cronbach's & alpha; was used for internal reliability. Convergent validity was examined with BDI-II and PHQ-9. Receiver operating characteristics analyses were used to identify optimal PAID-5 cut-offs for the diagnosis of depression. ResultsAll three screening tools were highly reliable, with BDI-II, PHQ-9 and PAID-5 having a Cronbach's & alpha; of 0.910, 0.870 and 0.940, respectively. There was a good correlation between BDI-II and PHQ-9, with a correlation co-efficient (r) of 0.73; and a moderate correlation between PAID-5 and PHQ-9, and PAID-5 and BDI-II, with r of 0.55 and 0.55 respectively (P values <0.01). An optimal PAID-5 cut-off & GE;9 corresponded to both a BDI-II cut-off >14 (sensitivity 72%, specificity 784%, area under the curve 0.809) and a PHQ-9 cut-off >10 (sensitivity 84%, specificity 74%, area under the curve 0.806). Using a PAID-5 cut-off & GE;9, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 36.1%. ConclusionsDepressive symptoms are prevalent in people with type 2 diabetes, with the degree of distress significantly related to the severity of depressive symptoms. PAID-5 is a valid and reliable screening tool, and a score & GE;9 could prompt further confirmation for depression.

This article studies an N-step synthesis approach of output feedback MPC for LFC systems considering the problems of communication efficiency and network security. First, to improve the communication efficiency, an adaptive event-triggering (AET) scheme involving two adaptive laws is designed to reduce the number of transmitted data packages which offers more flexible compared with existing event-triggering schemes; Second, to handle the network security, a new model of LFC power system combining the AET scheme and random deception attack under an unified framework is established; Moreover, a synthesis approach of output feedback MPC with N-step strategy is addressed for LFC of power system by parameterizing the infinite control moves into a series of output feedback laws. Compared with the existing predictive load frequency control methods, the present technique is shown as an useful way to improve the control performance since more degrees freedom is introduced by the N-step strategy. Finally, the simulation experiment is carried out to verify our technique.

However, an effective and systematic way to tuning the properties of these polymers is still lacking. Here in this work, we report a new method to preparing PBSs with versatile properties. By increasing the degree of polymerization of boronic acid end-functionalized polydimethylsiloxane, a series of well-defined PBSs with different mechanical properties were obtained. Various instruments such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and rheometer have been used to characterize the obtained products. By looking into the results we found rheological behaviors of these samples were closely related to their specific microstructures, shear stiffening of these polymers were directly related to the dynamics of hydrogen bonds rather than dative B-O bonds. These new findings provide important insights for the development of PBSs with desired properties.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and China Wanfang for studies published in English or Chinese. Studies focusing on any disparities in healthcare services among PLWH in China and published between January 2000 and July 2022 were included. ResultsIn all, 51 articles met the inclusion criteria, with 37 studies reporting HIV-focused care, and 14 reporting non-HIV-focused care. PLWH aged & GE;45 years (vs. <45 years), female (vs. male), ethnic minority (vs. Han), and cases attributed to sexual transmission (vs. injecting drug use) were more likely to receive ART. Females living with HIV have higher ART adherence than males. Notably, 20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 9-43%, I-2 = 96%] of PLWH reported any illness in the previous 2 weeks without medical consultation, and 30% (95% CI: 12-74%, I-2 = 90%) refused hospitalization when needed in the previous year. Barriers to HIV-focused care included inadequate HIV/ART knowledge and treatment side effects at the individual level; and social discrimination and physician-patient relationships at the community/social level. Structural barriers included medical costs and transportation issues. The most frequently reported barriers to non-HIV-focused care were financial constraints and the perceived need for medical services at individual-level factors; and discrimination from physicians, and medical distrust at the community/social level. ConclusionThis review suggests disparities in access and utilization of healthcare among PLWH. Financial issues and social discrimination were prominent reasons. Creating a supportive social environment and expanding insurance policies could be considered to promote healthcare equity.

Artificial life aims to foster a comprehensive study of life beyond "life as we know it" and toward "life as it could be," with theoretical, synthetic, and empirical models of the fundamental properties of living systems. While still a relatively young field, artificial life has flourished as an environment for researchers with different backgrounds, welcoming ideas, and contributions from a wide range of subjects. Hybrid Life brings our attention to some of the most recent developments within the artificial life community, rooted in more traditional artificial life studies but looking at new challenges emerging from interactions with other fields. Hybrid Life aims to cover studies that can lead to an understanding, from first principles, of what systems are and how biological and artificial systems can interact and integrate to form new kinds of hybrid (living) systems, individuals, and societies. To do so, it focuses on three complementary perspectives: theories of systems and agents, hybrid augmentation, and hybrid interaction. Theories of systems and agents are used to define systems, how they differ (e.g., biological or artificial, autonomous, or nonautonomous), and how multiple systems relate in order to form new hybrid systems. Hybrid augmentation focuses on implementations of systems so tightly connected that they act as a single, integrated one. Hybrid interaction is centered around interactions within a heterogeneous group of distinct living and nonliving systems. After discussing some of the major sources of inspiration for these themes, we will focus on an overview of the works that appeared in Hybrid Life special sessions, hosted by the annual Artificial Life Conference between 2018 and 2022.This article is categorized under:Neuroscience > CognitionPhilosophy > Artificial IntelligenceComputer Science and Robotics > Robotics	[Baltieri, Manuel] Araya Inc, Tokyo, Japan; [Baltieri, Manuel] Univ Sussex, Dept Informat, Brighton, England; [Iizuka, Hiroyuki] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Informat Sci & Technol, Sapporo, Japan; [Iizuka, Hiroyuki; Witkowski, Olaf; Suzuki, Keisuke] Hokkaido Univ, Ctr Human Nat Artificial Intelligence & Neurosci C, Sapporo, Japan; [Witkowski, Olaf] Cross Compass, Cross Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Witkowski, Olaf] Univ Tokyo, Coll Arts & Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Sinapayen, Lana] Sony Comp Sci Labs, Kyoto, Japan; [Sinapayen, Lana] Natl Inst Basic Biol, Okazaki, Japan	University of Sussex; Hokkaido University; Hokkaido University; University of Tokyo; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB)	Baltieri, M (corresponding author), Araya Inc, Tokyo, Japan.	manuel_baltieri@araya.org		Sinapayen, Lana/0000-0003-2270-2954; Baltieri, Manuel/0000-0002-6086-4711					151	0	0	7	7	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1939-5078	1939-5086		WIRES COGN SCI	Wiley Interdiscip.

MethodsEight discs (8 x 1 mm) of 20 shades of GCRBC were prepared. Color coordinates were measured against a gray background with a calibrated spectroradiometer, CIE D65 illuminant and the CIE 45 & DEG;/0 & DEG; geometry at baseline and after 30 days of storage in distilled water, coffee, and red wine. Color differences ( increment E00$$ \Delta {E}_{00} $$) between final and baseline conditions were calculated. An ATR-FTIR spectrometer with a diamond tip was used to calculate DC%. The results were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test. The level of significance was p < 0.05. ResultsDC% and color stability correlated with each other and with the GCRBC brand. DC% ranged between 43% and 96%, highest values correspond to flowable composites. All composites have experienced color changes after immersion in water, wine and coffee. However, the magnitude of the color change has varied widely depending on the immersion medium and the GCRBC. Color changes generated by the wine were, globally, greater than those induced by coffee (p < 0.001) and above the acceptability thresholds. ConclusionsThe DC% of GCRBCs is sufficient to achieve adequate biocompatibility and physicomechanical properties, but the high susceptibility to staining could compromise aesthetic long-term results. Clinical SignificanceThe degree of conversion and the color stability of gingiva-colored resin-based composites correlated with each other.

Color changes generated by wine were, globally, greater than those induced by coffee and above the acceptability thresholds that could compromise aesthetic long-term results.

In this study, we rationally control the topology and porosity of zirconium-fumarate frameworks by simply changing the synthesis conditions, and successfully construct an adsorbent (named as MIP-203-F) with one-dimensional pore instead of the original cage-like fcu metal-organic framework MOF-801. The Xe/Kr separation performance of MIP-203-F is thoroughly evaluated by isotherm measurements and breakthrough experiments, while the adsorption mechanism is elucidated in detail by Monte Carlo and density functional theory calculations. Due to the uniform pore with suitable size and abundant polarization groups, MIP-203-F can differentially polarize and recognize atomic Xe/Kr gases, and establishes a new record among zirconium-organic frameworks for the capture and separation of Xe/Kr.

Collaborators, invited to collect online survey data through Psi Chi's Network for International Collaborative Exchange crowd-sourcing initiative (Edlund et al., 2019), recruited approximately 100 participants across 22 data-collection locations (final N = 4620). Participants completed randomized online surveys, which inquired about an individual's PNFS, and current perceptions, behaviors and knowledge surrounding the pandemic. Results indicated that individuals with higher PNFS fared better at navigating the rules and restrictions that came with the pandemic. Specifically, and contrary to hypotheses, higher PNFS positively predicted knowledge of COVID-19 and support for government restrictions and negatively predicted belief in pandemic misinformation. Additionally, PNFS significantly positively predicted the use of problem and emotion-focused coping strategies and did not predict dysfunctional coping mechanisms. Our findings emphasize the role individual differences play in navigating the pandemic, and future research should evaluate PNFS in light of COVID-19 and in relation to other behavioral and psychological outcomes.

Due to the commonly used networked communication structure, the semi-Markovian jumping modes and fuzzy premise variables cannot always perfectly match for system and controller among the whole system operation. More precisely, both asynchronous phenomena in fuzzy membership and jumping mode are taken into account, and then, mode-dependent finite-time controllers are developed with these features. By utilizing stochastic analysis and Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, sufficient criteria are first established for the closed-loop system in the context of mean-square sense. Furthermore, feedback controller gains are captured by the matrix technique and parallel distributed compensation (PDC)-related arguments. Eventually, a simulation example of an unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) is utilized to demonstrate the validity of the developed results.

This protein can anchor to the cell membrane by an in-plane amphipathic ⍺-helix, which participates in the viral replication complex. In this study, the effects of synonymous codon usage pattern of NS5A and the overall transfer RNA (tRNA) abundance in cells on the formation of the in-plane membrane anchor of NS5A were analyzed, based on NS5A coding sequences of different BVDV genotypes. BVDV NS5A coding sequences represent the most potential for BVDV genotyping. Moreover, the nucleotide usage of BVDV NS5A dominates the genotype-specific pattern of synonymous codon usage. There is an obvious relationship between synonymous codon usage bias and the spatial conformation of the in-plane membrane anchor. Furthermore, the overall tRNA abundance profiling displays that codon positions with a high level of tRNA abundance are more than ones with a low level of tRNA abundance in the in-plane membrane anchor, implying that high translation speed probably acts on the spatial conformation of in-plane membrane anchor of BVDV NS5A. These results give a new opinion on the effect of codon usage bias in the formation of the in-plane membrane anchor of BVDV NS5A.

Moreover, we show that equality is achieved if and only if the graph is either a petal graph (for N $N$ odd) or a book graph (for N $N$ even). This implies that 12,32 $\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right)$ is a maximal gap interval for the normalized Laplacian on connected graphs. This is closely related to the Alon-Boppana bound on regular graphs and a recent result by Kollar and Sarnak on cubic graphs. Our result also provides a sharp bound for the convergence rate of some eigenvalues of the Laplacian on neighborhood graphs.

This study analyses the association between birth-related factors (the number of childbirths, abortions and miscarriages) and periodontitis using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which represents Korean adults.Materials and Methods: The study used data from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI and VII (2013-2018) and included 10,072 women 19 years or older, with no missing data on the variables assessed. Periodontitis was defined according to the Community Periodontal Index (CPI) criteria. Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, household income, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, body mass index, waist circumference, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, an oral examination within 1 year, daily tooth brushing frequency, hygiene products and self-perceived oral health as identified via logistic regression analyses, was performed to determine the association between birth-related variables and periodontitis.Results: In the crude model, the odds ratio (OR) showed a significantly increased risk of periodontitis (CPI & GE; 3) and severe periodontitis (CPI = 4) based on the number of childbirths, abortions and miscarriages (p < .05). After covariate adjustment, periodontitis (CPI & GE; 3) was associated with the number of childbirths (1: OR = 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-2.50; 2: OR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.57-2.61; & GE;3: OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.60-2.78). Furthermore, severe periodontitis (CPI = 4) was also associated with the number of childbirths (1: OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.24-4.38; 2: OR = 2.99; 95% CI: 1.62-5.52=3: OR = 3.34; 95% CI: 1.79-6.21).Conclusions: The findings of this large-scale, nationally representative study suggest that the number of childbirths is associated with the severity of periodontitis. However, the relationship between the number of abortions and miscarriages and periodontitis (CPI =3) or severe periodontitis (CPI = 4) is not significant.

J	Lobban, M				Lobban, Michael			The Travels of Treason	MODERN LAW REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access							LAW	The law of treason has been criticised for being based on 'outdated' statutes which are inflexible and unsuitable for modern needs. However, a historical examination of the evolution of treason in Britain and its empire suggests that the law was often adaptable. In nineteenth century England, jurists wished to rein in older constructive treasons, to leave the 1351 Act as the appropriate law for wartime treasons, while the more lenient 1848 Act was to be used against 'political' conspiracies to subvert the state by force. However, the 'constructive' treasons remained part of the law, and were given new life in imperial contexts. In Ireland and Canada, the idea that plotting the king's 'political' death was treason remained central to understandings of the 1351 Act. In India, the interpretation of the provision of the penal code against 'waging war' against the government was influenced by old English ideas of 'constructive' treason and used against those who challenged British rule. Imperial understandings of treason were also shaped by cases arising out of the Boer war, where the underlying law was Roman-Dutch law. Rather than being restrictive and unable to adapt to modern needs, the law of treason was flexible and malleable.

There has been little recent evidence, however, of the marital context in which early childbearing occurs or how this relationship varies across space and levels of development. Using survey and vital registration data covering approximately 95 percent of the world's births to mothers younger than 18 years, we estimated the share of first births that occur within marriage at the global, regional and national levels. We found that more than half of births to mothers below age 18 worldwide take place in sub-Saharan Africa, and this share will continue to grow. Globally, 76 percent of first births to mothers below age 18 occur within marriage and there are large regional differences. Over the past two decades, the share of first births to mothers below age 18 occurring within marriage declined in most countries with data available, but there are important exceptions. Although most first births to women below age 18 occur following seven months of marriage, the sequencing of child marriage and early childbearing varies widely across countries.

J	Park, DY; Park, J				Park, Dae-youl; Park, Joongki			Improving the quality of light-field data extracted from a hologram using deep learning	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						deep learning; generative adversarial network; holography; light field; speckle noise	COMPUTER-GENERATED HOLOGRAM; NETWORK	We propose a method to suppress the speckle noise and blur effects of the light field extracted from a hologram using a deep-learning technique. The light field can be extracted by bandpass filtering in the hologram's frequency domain. The extracted light field has reduced spatial resolution owing to the limited passband size of the bandpass filter and the blurring that occurs when the object is far from the hologram plane and also contains speckle noise caused by the random phase distribution of the three-dimensional object surface. These limitations degrade the reconstruction quality of the hologram resynthesized using the extracted light field. In the proposed method, a deep-learning model based on a generative adversarial network is designed to suppress speckle noise and blurring, resulting in improved quality of the light field extracted from the hologram. The model is trained using pairs of original two-dimensional images and their corresponding light-field data extracted from the complex field generated by the images. Validation of the proposed method is performed using light-field data extracted from holograms of objects with single and multiple depths and mesh-based computer-generated holograms.

Hazardous drinking by older adults with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from a Chicago-based cohort	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						chronic conditions; COVID-19; hazardous drinking	DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDER; AUDIT-C; ASSOCIATION; CONSUMPTION; RETIREMENT; BEHAVIORS; MORBIDITY; PATTERNS	Background: It is unclear how older adults with chronic conditions, who have greater risk of alcohol-related adverse outcomes, used alcohol throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We assess changes in hazardous drinking prevalence May 2020-December 2021 and factors associated with hazardous drinking.Methods: Data are from structured phone interviews of older adults (age 60+) with chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease, heart disease) in a Chicago-based longitudinal cohort (Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities survey, Waves 3-7, n = 247). We tested differences in the prevalence of hazardous drinking (defined as AUDIT-C score of 3+ for women and 4+ for men) across waves for the full sample, by demographic group (sex, race, and ethnicity), and by chronic condition burden (<3 conditions, 3+ conditions). Generalized estimating equations investigated associations of hazardous drinking with sociodemographic and pandemic coping-related factors (stress, loneliness, outside contacts, depression, anxiety).Results: Participants were 66.8% female; 27.9% non-Hispanic Black, 14.2% Hispanic, 4.9% other race. Hazardous drinking was reported by 44.9% of participants in May 2020, but declined to 23.1% by July-August 2020 and continued to slowly decline to 19.4% by September-December 2021. Differences from May 2020 were significant at the 0.05 level. Subgroups followed similar trajectories. Hazardous drinking prevalence was initially higher but declined more among men than women, consistently higher among non-Hispanic White respondents than among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black respondents, and declined more rapidly among adults with 3+ chronic conditions. In adjusted models, race and ethnicity were associated with lower prevalence of hazardous drinking (non-Hispanic Black: adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33, 0.74; other race: aPR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.81, compared with non-Hispanic White). No coping-related factors were significantly associated with hazardous drinking.Conclusion: Among a cohort of older adults with chronic conditions, almost half engaged in hazardous drinking in early summer of the COVID-19 pandemic. While prevalence fell, these rates reinforce the need for alcohol screening and intervention in clinical settings among this population.

JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						esophageal varices; non-invasive markers of portal hypertension; APRI; FIB-4; surveillance endoscopy	PORTAL-HYPERTENSION; PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS; LONG-TERM; NONINVASIVE PREDICTORS; LIVER FIBROSIS; CIRRHOSIS; DECOMPENSATION; MANAGEMENT; DERIVATION; DIAGNOSIS	Background and AimPortal hypertension determines the outcome of children with biliary atresia (BA) and is common even after a successful Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE). However, there are no clear-cut guidelines on the age of starting surveillance and the modality (endoscopy vs non-invasive tests [NITs]). In this cohort study, we analyzed our database to find out the utility of NITs in detecting high-risk esophageal varices in BA. MethodsFrom June 2010 to May 2022, consecutive children of BA who underwent upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy were included. Esophageal varices were classified as high-risk (grade II with red-color signs or grade III or IV irrespective of red-color signs. NITs such as splenomegaly (clinical and USG), platelet count, aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and platelet-to-spleen diameter ratio were compared between cases with high-risk and low-risk varices. ResultsA total of 110 children, 75 boys (66 successful KPE and 44 failed/KPE not performed) were enrolled. The median age at KPE was 85 days (IQR 63-98). Thirteen (11.8%) children presented with UGI bleeding. The first endoscopy revealed gastroesophageal varices in 75.4% of cases, and 32% of them had high-risk varices. Multivariate analysis revealed failed KPE, history of UGI bleeding, bigger spleen size (> 3.5 cm), lower platelet count (< 150 000), and higher APRI (> 2) are independent predictors of the presence of high-risk esophageal varices. ConclusionEndoscopy is the best in predicting the presence of high-risk varices that might bleed; hence, early surveillance endoscopy should be started in children with splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and high APRI score to prevent variceal bleeding.

It is still a great challenge to achieve the good comprehensive performance of high thermal conductivity (TC), insulation, flexibility and tensile strength. In this work, polyester-based nonwoven fabric (NWF) was coated with boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) by dispersion and interfacial reinforcement of cellulose nanofibers to obtain a three-dimensional thermally conductive network skeleton (BNNS@NWF). The sandwich-structured composite film was assembled by introducing alumina (Al2O3)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers on the top and bottom surfaces of BNNS@NWF using scratch coating and hot pressing processes. The composite film has a high TC of 6.42 W/mK at 45.8 wt% BNNS content, and has excellent insulation with a volume resistivity of 1.06 x 10(15) ? cm. This is due to the long-range effective thermal conduction path constructed by BNNS, the bridging effect of Al2O3 and the synergistic effect of the two fillers. PDMS helps the composite film maintain good flexibility and good TC stability after 30 bending cycles. The PET nonwoven interlayer gives the composite film good mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 17.5 MPa. This work provides a strategy for the efficient preparation of flexible composite films with high TC and insulation properties, which is of great importance for the development of innovative thermal interface materials.

From a western lens, this pattern might be considered paradoxical, since there is a robust positive relationship between theory of mind (ToM) and inhibitory control in western samples. In independent cultures, an emphasis on one's own mind offers a clear route to 'simulate' other minds, and inhibitory control may be required to set aside one's own perspective to represent the perspective of others. However, in interdependent cultures, social norms are considered the key catalyst for behaviour, and metacognitive reflection and/or suppression of one's own perspective may not be necessary. The cross-cultural generalizability of the western developmental route to ToM is therefore questionable. The current study used an age-matched cross-sectional sample to contrast 56 Japanese and 56 Scottish 3-6-year-old's metacognition, ToM and inhibitory control skills. We replicated the expected cultural patterns for ToM (Scotland > Japan) and inhibitory control (Japan > Scotland). Supporting western developmental enrichment theories, we find that inhibitory control and metacognition predict theory of mind competence in Scotland. However, these variables cannot be used to predict Japanese ToM. This confirms that individualistic mechanisms do not capture the developmental mechanism underlying ToM in Japan, highlighting a bias in our understanding of ToM development. Research HighlightsWe replicate an independent cultural advantage for theory of mind (Scotland > Japan) and interdependent advantage for inhibitory control (Japan > Scotland).From a western lens, this pattern might be considered paradoxical, since there is a robust positive relationship between theory of mind and inhibitory control.Supporting western developmental enrichment theories, we find that the development of inhibitory control mediates the link between metacognition and theory of mind in Scotland.However, this model does not predict Japanese theory of mind, highlighting an individualistic bias in our mechanistic understanding of theory of mind development.

This default view has been progressively undermined by research on 'implicit' ToM, which suggests that relevant precursor abilities may already be present in preverbal human infants and great apes. However, this area of research suffers from conceptual difficulties and empirical limitations, including explanatory circularity, over-intellectualisation, and inconsistent empirical replication. Our article breaks new ground by adapting 'script theory' for application to both linguistic and non-linguistic agents. It thereby provides a new theoretical framework able to resolve the aforementioned issues, generate novel predictions, and provide a plausible account of how individuals make sense of the behaviour of others. Script theory is based on the premise that pre-verbal infants and great apes are capable of basic forms of agency-detection and non-mentalistic goal understanding, allowing individuals to form event-schemata that are then used to make sense of the behaviour of others. We show how script theory circumvents fundamental problems created by ToM-based frameworks, explains patterns of inconsistent replication, and offers important novel predictions regarding how humans and other animals understand and predict the behaviour of others.

The secreted insecticidal proteins (Sips) produced by the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis exhibit potent insecticidal activity against coleopteran pests and are, therefore, attractive as candidate biopesticides. However, the modes-of-action of Sips are unclear as comprehensive structural information for these proteins is lacking. RESULTS: Using X-ray crystallography, we elucidated the structure of monomeric Sip1Ab at 2.28 angstrom resolution. Structural analyses revealed that Sip1Ab has the three domains and conserved fold characteristic of other aerolysin-like beta-pore-forming toxins (beta-PFTs). Based on the sequence and structural similarities between Sip1Ab and other ETX_MTX2 subfamily toxins, we suggested the mechanism of these proteins and proposed that it is common to them all. CONCLUSION: The atomic-level structural data for Sip1Ab generated by the present study could facilitate future structural and mechanistic research on Sips as well as their application in sustainable insect pest management.

Together with oropharyngeal carcinoma, it is the fifth to sixth most common malignancy worldwide. To limit the increase in the global oral cancer incidence over the past two decades, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution urging member states to integrate preventive measures such as engagement and training of dental personnel in screening, early diagnosis, and treatment into their national cancer control programs.Aim:The aim of this study was to investigate if dental hygienists (DHs) and dentists (Ds) in general dental practice care can be entrusted to perform brush sampling of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), and to evaluate their level of comfort in performing brush biopsies.Methods: Participants were five DHs and five Ds who received one day of theoretical and clinical training in oral pathology to identify OPMDs (leukoplakia [LP], erythroplakia [EP], and oral lichen planus [OLP]), and perform brush sampling for PAP cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) analysis.Results: Out of 222 collected samples, 215 were adequate for morphological assessment and hrHPV analysis. All the participants agreed that sample collection can be incorporated in DHs and Ds routine clinical duties, and most of them reported that sample collection and processing was easy/quite easy.Conclusion: Dentists and DHs are capable of collecting satisfactory material for cytology and hrHPV analysis. All the participating DHs and Ds were of the opinion that brush sampling could be handled routinely by DHs and Ds in GDP.

The performances are improved by acknowledging both the exceptional properties of ZnS as a buffer layer, and the beneficial contributions of an indium-enrich layer, which form a surface defect layer at the ZnS/CIGSe heterojunction. SCAPS-1D numerical modeling software is used to conduct calculations, and the structure using ZnS enables achieving an efficiency of 24.31%. Deeper investigation on the effects of variation of functional layers properties such as bandgap, electron affinity, doping level, and thickness enables retaining an optimized structure, and results show an improved efficiency of 25.22% and a fill factor of 80.26%, indicating of a fluid flow of charge carriers, thus a more stable device. All simulations are performed considering experimental environment parameters, an external temperature of 300 K, light illumination of AM1.5G, and defects states are assumed in both the bulk and at interfaces.

Accumulating evidences have revealed the functions of viral proteins of AqRVs in RNA transcription, virion assembly, cell attachment and/or viral replication. In addition, structural information and transcription mechanism of AqRVs have been in-depth studied through cryo-electron microscopy combined with three-dimensional image reconstruction. Although far from enough, structural and functional studies of AqRVs provide substantial insights into how viral proteins coordinate the replication of AqRVs and escape the host immune response. Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is the most pathogenic AqRV isolated from aquatic animals. The completion of GCRV lifecycle requires the participation of host proteins. So far, many host factors involved in the entry and replication of GCRV have been identified. Based on the function of viral proteins and the viral lifecycle, many vaccines and antiviral agents have been developed to prevent the replication and infection of GCRV. This review summarises the structural characteristics and the composition of core proteins of AqRVs, as well as synergistic mechanisms of structural proteins on genome transcription and virus entry of AqRVs. In addition, the review highlights our current knowledge for the infection and replication, functions of non-structural proteins, immune escape mechanisms, as well as the vaccines and antiviral agents of AqRVs, especially for GCRV. A better understanding of structure, function and immune evasion strategies of AqRVs will offer new targets for prevention and control of AqRVs in aquaculture.

Methods: In 106 older adult participants residing in nursing/care homes or participating in community-level preventive care activities, the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA (R)-SF) for nutritional status and oral diadochokinesis (ODK), tongue pressure, and repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST) for oral function, 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Diet-Related Quality of Life Scale-Short Form (DRQOL-SF), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were administered. Basic information, including cognitive function, was evaluated. Hierarchical MNA (dependent variable)-based multiple regression analysis was performed, followed by path analysis using factors with significant associations with MNA scores. Results: RSST, ODK, tongue pressure, FIM, and DRQOL were positively correlated with MNA scores and GDS was negatively correlated. Hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated associations with tongue pressure, GDS, FIM, DRQOL scores, and gender. Path analysis confirmed significant paths from tongue pressure to MNA, tongue pressure to FIM, and FIM to MNA (P < .001). Significant paths were confirmed from GDS to MNA (P < .01), from DRQOL to MNA (P < .05), and from gender to MNA (P < .01). Conclusions: Tongue pressure, GDS, FIM, DRQOL scores, and gender were identified as factors that directly affect MNA. Tongue pressure showed the greatest effect and indirectly affected MNA via FIM. These findings emphasize the importance of early detection of low nutritional risk for preventing depression and oral function deterioration, and of evaluation of dietary satisfaction and improvement of quality of life in diets.

This paper examines the determinants of the internal audit (IA) function in MFIs, with particular emphasis on the business goals, specifically efficiency, productivity, regulation and the gross portfolio yield. We also investigate whether the establishment of an IA function is associated with MFI's focus on their social objectives relating to outreach, and women director appointments. Multivariate regression results from 1025 MFIs across 63 countries show that MFIs' focus on their social objectives is related to their propensity to establish an IA function. Thus, outreach and women director appointments are positively related to the establishment of an IA function. Similarly, in terms of the performance emphasis, the gross portfolio yield (inefficiency) increases (decreases) the likelihood of establishing an IA, but productivity and regulation have no effect. The findings suggest that MFIs' dual focus on social and business objectives impacts the establishment of internal audits. The results are robust to various measurements and estimations.

J	Pramila, RP; Subhashini, R				Pramila, Rayappa Priyanka; Subhashini, Radhakrishnan			Automated skin lesion detection and classification using fused deep convolutional neural network on dermoscopic images	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Early Access						computer aided diagnosis; deep convolutional neural network; deep learning; dermoscopic images; fusion model; skin lesion		Skin cancer becomes a deadly disease that affect people of all ages globally. The availability of various types of benign and malignant melanoma makes the skin lesion diagnostic process difficult. Since the visual inspection of skin cancer is costlier and lengthy process, it is needed to design automatic diagnosis model to classify skin lesions accurately and promptly. Computer-aided diagnosis models can be employed to identify the presence of skin lesions using dermoscopic images. The automatic identification of skin lesions can assist the doctors and enable the detection process at an efficient and faster rate. With this motivation, this article presents an automated skin lesion detection and classification using fused deep convolutional neural network (ASDC-FDCNN) on dermoscopic images. The ASDC-FDCNN technique aims to identify the existence of skin lesions from dermoscopic images. The ASDC-FDCNN model involves the design of two deep learning models namely VGG19 and ResNet152 models. Besides, the fusion based feature extraction process is performed to derive feature vectors. In addition, the DCNN technique was employed as classifier for identifying the presence or absence of skin lesions. The performance validation of the ASDC-FDCNN technique takes place utilizing benchmark skin lesion dataset. A comparative results analysis reported the better performance of the ASDC-FDCNN model over the recent technique with respect to various measures.

However, it is usually energy intensive. The dividing-wall column (DWC) is a promising and practical energy-saving process intensification technology. The DWC for batch distillation (batch DWC) to separate benzene, toluene, and xylene mixtures was examined with composition and temperature control structures to verify its controllability. Besides, the batch DWC outperforms the conventional single-column batch distillation and middle-vessel batch distillation in terms of distillation time and energy consumption under the same conditions. In terms of more practical temperature control results, the batch DWC saves 63 % of energy compared with the conventional single-column batch distillation and 47 % of energy compared with the middle-vessel batch distillation.

J	Smith, P				Smith, Patriann			Black Immigrant Literacies and the Promise of Unbroken Englishes: Five Things Every Teacher Should Know and Can Do	READING TEACHER			English	Article						black; immigrant; black immigrants; literacy; literacies; race; language; immigration; translanguaging; transraciolinguistics; black immigrant literacies; Bahamas; Caribbean; Afro-Caribbean	STUDENTS; 2ND-GENERATION; ACHIEVEMENT; PERFORMANCE; IDENTITIES; AMERICAN; AFRICAN; NEEDS; RACE	"Black immigrant literacies" is an intersectional framework that draws from diaspora literacy, racial literacy, and transnational literacy to center race and present teachers with a lens that can support Black immigrant students and their peers' literacies in classrooms. Black immigrant youth can be described as first-, second-, or third-generation immigrants to the United States who identify as Black and who migrate to the United States from Africa, the Caribbean, or elsewhere. Many students from the Black immigrant population, though largely "invisible," tend to be regarded as a new model minority and as designer immigrants. New model minority perceptions of Black immigrants persist because of claims of immigrant superiority and because Black immigrants have long been perceived as having socioeconomic advantages over their Black American peers. Given that Black immigrants originate primarily from the Caribbean or Africa, accounting for over half of all Black foreign-born people in the United States, and considering that the Caribbean remains the most common region of birth for the over 4 million Black immigrants in the United States, accounting for almost half of the total, I paint a selective portrait of the intersectionalities surrounding Black immigrant literacies as a basis for teachers to better understand Black immigrant students' needs in classrooms. I also draw specifically from Black Caribbean immigrant literacies to identify and describe five things that every teacher should know and can do when encountering Black Caribbean in English language arts and literacy instruction. Through provisions such as legitimizing "unbroken Englishes," supporting "translanguaging with Englishes," cultivating "holistic literacies," and fostering "local-global connections," it is anticipated that teachers of Black immigrants in the United States, Caribbean, and beyond will begin to unmask invisibility of this population in their classrooms. Through the use of this framework, it is also expected that teachers will be able to better support all students who engage with the literacies of Black immigrants in United States schools.

These women are viewed as problem-solvers and rescuers, on the one hand, or as enablers and "codependents" on the other. These attitudes may reflect society's ideas of women's gender-related caretaking role.Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 women whose spouses had a diagnosis of lifetime AUD.Results: Content analysis yielded three themes regarding the kinds of messages the women received: responsible and guilty, distanced and silenced, and reinforced and supported. The women indicated internalization of these messages and expressed they felt guilty, ashamed, and excluded, but in some cases, strengthened.Conclusion: Society and the people around these women bear responsibility for the negative images they internalize.Implications: Awareness of the implicit and explicit messages conveyed to these women is needed. Specific interventions should be designed to validate their difficulties and support them.

Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment of ceftriaxone 2 g once daily in non-critically ill hospitalized adult patients during the acute phase of infection	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						ceftriaxone; non-ICU patients; pharmacokinetic; pharmacodynamic; probability of target attainment; severe infection	MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATION; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACODYNAMICS; BREAKPOINTS; SOCIETY; TIME	AimsPharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment of ceftriaxone is compromised in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and non-ICU hospitalized patients in Beira, Mozambique. Whether this also accounts for non-ICU patients in a high-income setting is unknown. We therefore assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) of the currently recommended dosing regimen of 2 g every 24 h (q24h) in this patient group. MethodsWe performed a multicentre population pharmacokinetic study in hospitalized non-ICU adult patients empirically treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. During both the acute phase of infection (i.e. first 24 h of treatment) and convalescence, a maximum of 4 random blood samples were obtained per patient for ceftriaxone total and unbound concentration measurements. PTA was calculated using NONMEM and was defined as the percentage of patients of which the unbound ceftriaxone concentration exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for >50% of the first dosing interval of 24 h. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine PTA for different estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR; CKD-EPI) and MICs. PTA >90% was considered adequate. ResultsForty-one patients provided 252 ceftriaxone total and 253 unbound concentrations. The median eGFR was 65 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (5th to 95th percentile 36-122). With the recommended dose of 2 g q24h, PTA >90% was achieved for bacteria with an MIC & LE;2 mg/L. Simulations showed that PTA was insufficient for an MIC of 4 mg/L in case the eGFR was 122 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (PTA 56.9%) and for an MIC of 8 mg/L regardless of eGFR. ConclusionThe PTA of 2 g q24h ceftriaxone dosing is adequate for common pathogens during the acute phase of infection in non-ICU patients.

Plants have evolved multiple adaptive mechanisms, including alternative splicing, that allow them to withstand this stress. However, how alternative splicing contributes to heat stress responses in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is unclear.We reveal that the heat shock transcription factor gene TaHSFA6e is alternatively spliced in response to heat stress. TaHSFA6e generates two major functional transcripts: TaHSFA6e-II and TaHSFA6e-III. TaHSFA6e-III enhances the transcriptional activity of three downstream heat shock protein 70 (TaHSP70) genes to a greater extent than does TaHSFA6e-II. Further investigation reveals that the enhanced transcriptional activity of TaHSFA6e-III is due to a 14-amino acid peptide at its C-terminus, which arises from alternative splicing and is predicted to form an amphipathic helix.Results show that knockout of TaHSFA6e or TaHSP70s increases heat sensitivity in wheat. Moreover, TaHSP70s are localized in stress granule following exposure to heat stress and are involved in regulating stress granule disassembly and translation re-initiation upon stress relief. Polysome profiling analysis confirms that the translational efficiency of stress granule stored mRNAs is lower at the recovery stage in Tahsp70s mutants than in the wild types.Our finding provides insight into the molecular mechanisms by which alternative splicing improves the thermotolerance in wheat.

Ternary 2D bismuth sulfide semiconductor (BiXI, X = S, Se, Te) is an ideal candidate for broadband photoelectric detection due to its narrow bandgap and excellent electrical transport performance. Here, BiSeI is grown by chemical vapor transport (CVT) method and used in photoelectrochemical (PEC) photodetection. The PEC-type photodetector based on BiSeI nanosheets has a broadband detection ranging from 350 to 900 nm, displaying a high responsivity of 2.88 mA W-1, a high detectivity of 1.10 x 10(10) Jones and a fast response time of 7/16 ms at a bias voltage of 0.5 V. Furthermore, the device also exhibits a negligible current density loss after three months, which indicates that it has good stability against air and moisture. In addition, the photodetector can work without bias potential, indicating that it is a good self-powered device. The results demonstrate that BiSeI is a potential material in self-powered PEC photodetector.

The dangling-bond-free surface and direct-bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near-unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potential to fabricate TMDC-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review, the aim is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction to the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described.

J	Barreca, F; Cardinali, G; Barbaresi, A; Bovo, M				Barreca, Francesco; Cardinali, Giuseppe; Barbaresi, Alberto; Bovo, Marco			Bio-based building components: A newly sustainable solution for traditional walls made of <i>Arundo donax</i> and gypsum	HEAT TRANSFER			English	Article; Early Access						biological components; biotechnology; buildings; phase change materials; systems	GIANT REED; BEESWAX	To contribute to the use of bio-based materials in the building sector, a novel bio-based wall panel, with a high thermal performance level, is proposed in this work. The panel is based on an ancient rural technique, widely diffused in southern Italy, which makes use of Arundo donax L. canes combined with gypsum plaster to build walls and ceilings of rural buildings. The enhancement of the thermal capacity of these panels by means of the introduction in the canes of a natural wax oleogel (WO) is proposed in this paper. A specific experimental campaign aiming at the comparison of traditional and innovative panels was carried out to assess the enhanced thermal performance of the proposed solution. The maximum value of heat flow absorbed from the panel with WO was 61.08 W/m(2) around a mean panel temperature of 24 & DEG;C, corresponding to the melting temperature range of the WO. The panel without WO at the same temperature absorbed an incoming heat flow of 34.64 W/m(2) which is about 57% of the panel with WO. The panel with WO released at a temperature of about 27.5 & DEG;C, a heat flow of 43.42 W/m(2). At the same temperature of about 27.5 & DEG;C, the panel without WO released a heat flow of 34.38 W/m(2) which is about 80% that of the panel with WO. The results highlighted that the addition of natural WO has enhanced the thermal capacity of the panel facilitating heat dissipation through the borders. These characteristics make the panel a suitable component for internal partitions of controlled temperature zones such as residential rooms, storage food areas, livestock buildings, and where it is necessary to obtain a constant environmental temperature. In particular, the null or low toxicity of the panel's materials allows for partition use, also in hygienically safe environments.

Due to their high nutritional value and wide commercial demand, peas (Pisum sativum L.) have become a new crop option in southern Colombia's cereal-growth areas. Bush varieties are required with low lodging, high yield, and good adaptation to environmental conditions. This study evaluated six lines of bush pea with the afila gene for yield and phenotypic stability in nine cereal-growing environments of southern Colombia in 2020 and 2021. A randomized block design with four replications was used in each environment. Phenotypic stability was studied using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model (AMMI). Visual observation of the biplot graph for principal components IPC1 and IPC2 showed higher contribution of genotypes ARB2, ARB12, and ARB13 to the genotype-environment interaction, while genotypes ARB10, ARB15, and ARB16 displayed the highest stability; only the last two genotypes exceeded the overall mean yield. The AMMI phenotypic stability values confirmed ARB10 and ARB15 as the most stable. The genotypic selection index ranked ARB15 and ARB16 as the most promising lines for the cereal-growing area of southern Colombia based on their stability and yield, making them new productive options.

This paper aims to analyze how Technology Development, Operations, Management, and Transaction innovation capabilities are interrelated with sustainable companies' social, environmental, and economic sustainability. We performed a multi-case study comprising sustainable small enterprises from four industries: sustainable fashion, sustainable hosting, shared furniture, and renewable energy. From the results, we propose that each innovation capability has three dimensions: social, environmental, and economic. Each dimension has a set of components that can differ across capabilities. We then develop a conceptual scheme, a new theoretical lens that intertwines the literature on innovation capabilities and sustainability. We propose the concepts of Sustainable Technology Development Capability, Sustainable Operations Capability, Sustainable Management Capability, and Sustainable Transaction Capability. Our findings can assist sustainable businesses to improve, and traditional companies to build, sustainable innovation capabilities.

Persistent effects of historical sea levels on the population structure of a temporary wetland copepod	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						calanoid copepod; dispersal barrier; historical demographic change; Lovenula raynerae; sea-level changes	EASTERN-CAPE; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; GENETIC-DISTANCE; CANARY-ISLANDS; FAIRY SHRIMP; DISPERSAL; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; COLONIZATION; CRUSTACEA; SOUTHERN	Temporary wetland ecosystems are common in arid and semi-arid environments, and are inhabited by diverse invertebrate communities. Little is known about the dynamics of genetic connectivity in the geographically scattered populations of these wetland specialists. The current study investigated the spatial genetic structure and dispersal history of a recently described calanoid copepod, Lovenula raynerae, reported from temporary wetlands in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. We tested whether the species represents a single, well-connected population or comprises different regional genetic groups, some of which may be rare or endangered. Mitochondrial COI sequences were generated for 365 specimens from 46 temporary wetlands spread across the species' known distribution range. Isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-environment patterns of partitioning genetic variations across the landscape were evaluated. In addition, the presence of historical impediments to gene flow between contemporary populations was investigated using a combination of Monmonier's algorithm and Bayesian reconstruction of phylogeographical diffusion in continuous space. The wetland populations were highly structured across the landscape and could be assigned to six distinct evolutionary lineages, potentially representing some level of cryptic speciation. Two distinct phases were identified in the dispersal history of these lineages. Initially, dispersal only occurred inland of a postulated barrier, but eventually the barrier disappeared and the species extended its range by spreading into regions close to the coastline. Molecular dating shows that the barrier represents the upper limit of the coastline during the Pliocene, and that its crossing was facilitated by Pliocene sea regression in southern Africa. Our finding shows that complex demographic histories can be preserved in the mitochondrial DNA of temporary wetland crustaceans because of limited effective gene flow after initial colonisation events. This makes them an interesting study system to explore the long-term effects of climate change on arid ecosystem communities.	[Emami-Khoyi, Arsalan; Jooste, Candice M.; Raath-Kruger, Morgan J.

Effect of metastatic calcification on complication rate and survival in 74 renal transplant cats (1998-2020)	VETERINARY SURGERY			English	Article; Early Access							SOFT-TISSUE CALCIFICATION; DISORDERED MINERAL METABOLISM; VASCULAR CALCIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; ARTERIES; DISEASE	ObjectiveTo report the incidence of metastatic calcification in cats with renal failure presenting for renal transplantation, and to determine if metastatic calcification detected prior to renal transplantation is associated with complication rates and patient survival. Study designRetrospective case series. Sample populationSeventy-four cats. MethodsIn imaging studies, 178 feline renal transplant recipients from 1998 to 2020 were evaluated for metastatic calcification. Demographic, clinicopathological data, intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, need for hemodialysis, and survival times were recorded. Exclusion criteria were cats lacking imaging reports and cats with gastric, renal, or tracheal/bronchial calcification alone. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine variables that were independently associated with survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to generate survival plots and estimate median survival times with a 95% confidence interval (CI). ResultsSeventy four of 178 cats met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen of 74 (20.3%) cats had metastatic calcification prior to renal transplantation. Twelve of 74 (16.2%) cats developed calcification following transplantation, and 47 of 74 (63.5%) cats had no calcification during the study period. Median follow-up time was 472 days, with a range of 0-1825 days. Cats with pretransplant calcification had shorter median survival times (147 days) than cats without calcification (646 days) (p = .0013). Metastatic calcification pretransplant was associated with an increased risk of death by 240% (95% CI, 1.22-4.71). ConclusionMetastatic calcification in renal transplant cats is a negative prognostic indicator and is associated with decreased survival times. Clinical significanceThese findings may help guide therapeutic recommendations and owner expectations in cats undergoing renal transplantation.

Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, single transition metal atoms (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first-principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu-O active site is rate-determining with an energy barrier of 0.48 eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offers excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.

The material was pre-strained by uni-axial tension in rolling and transverse direction. Thereafter, specimens were cut from the deformed plates in parallel or orthogonal to pre-strain direction. It was found that pre-strain increases yield and tensile strength. Results suggested that strain path change primarily affects the elastic-plastic transition during early stage of reloading. Pre-strained specimens showed an increase in high cycle regimes as a consequence of yield strength increment, irrespective of imposed pre-straining direction. A modified stress life equation that accounts for pre-strain was proposed and showed good agreement with experimental data. Bake hardening enhanced both tensile and high cycle fatigue resistance. Walker equation was successfully fitted to account for tensile mean stress. In low cycle fatigue, negligible influence of pre-strain was observed due to cyclic softening and residual stress relaxation.

In the scaling limit when n/N = 1 and n -> infinity we obtain the strong asymptotics of the polynomial p(n)(z). We show that the support of the roots converges to what we call the "multiple Szego curve," a certain connected curve having nu + 1 components in its complement.

The existing dual-stream models can be used for high-level feature fusion or unidirectionally transferring depth features to RGB features; however, they are unable to fully exploit the differences in modality. Furthermore, owing to the influence of image background information, the generated salient object is affected by background swallow. Herein, a three-stream RGB-D SOD method based on cross-layer and cross-modal dual-attention (CMDA) fusion is proposed. In the encoding stage, the CMDA fusion module is used to fuse RGB and depth features layer by layer. Through this module, merged interactive features may be used to extract the richer features of salient objects, realize the commonality and complementarity of fusion features, and achieve effective cross-modal fusion. In addition, for the decoding stage, a cross-level feature fusion module that introduces global context features into the up-sampling process, reduces the impact of salient objects being swallowed by the background, and helps to accurately detect salient areas is proposed. Three different branch features are used for simultaneous end-to-end training. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of multiple evaluation metrics on four datasets. Furthermore, the authors visualize the precision-recall curve, F-measure curve, and saliency map, which indicate that the detection effect of the proposed method is superior to those of other methods. During the testing stage, our model ran at 14 frames per second (FPS).

We describe the case of an 86-year-old man with esophageal stenosis caused by a thoracic osteophyte near the tracheal bifurcation. An endoscopic ultrasonography examination was scheduled to determine the cause of acute pancreatitis; however, lacerations observed at the bifurcation following endoscope removal during prior esophagogastroduodenoscopy led us to cancel the ultrasonography to avoid potential esophageal perforation. A review of the present case and six similar previous cases of thoracic osteophyte-associated esophageal stenosis (identified via a systematic search of the PubMed database) demonstrated the clinical importance of a thoracic osteophyte near physiological esophageal stenosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and computed tomography should be performed to screen for vertebral osteophytes before endoscopic ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and transesophageal echocardiography to avoid iatrogenic accidents.

Key parameters to all these systems for effective drug delivery are controlled release for sustained periods, targeted delivery, and enhancements of drug stability and efficacy, all of which can be manipulated by using polymers. Given the important impact of the structures of the polymers on these parameters, this mini-review gives a simple introduction to the requirements of drug delivery systems and surveys the synthetic pathways to a key polymer in this field, namely poly(lactic acid). We also review the preparation of block copolymers that incorporate poly(lactic acid), to expand and further develop its properties for drug delivery systems. It is hoped that this short teacherly and introductory review will provide a basic stepping-stone to more in-depth reviews and papers and enable an easy access to this fast growing field. & COPY; 2023 Society of Industrial Chemistry.

The potential contributions of m(6)A to the functions of RNA still need further investigation. In this study, we identified long noncoding RNA FAM111A-DT as an m(6)A-modified RNA and confirmed three m(6)A sites on FAM111A-DT. The m(6)A modification level of FAM111A-DT was increased in HCC tissues and cell lines, and increased m(6)A level was correlated with poor survival of HCC patients. m(6)A modification increased the stability of FAM111A-DT transcript, whose expression level showed similar clinical relevance to that of the m(6)A level of FAM111A-DT. Functional assays found that only m(6)A-modified FAM111A-DT promoted HCC cellular proliferation, DNA replication, and HCC tumor growth. Mutation of m(6)A sites on FAM111A-DT abolished the roles of FAM111A-DT. Mechanistic investigations found that m(6)A-modified FAM111A-DT bound to FAM111A promoter and also interacted with m(6)A reader YTHDC1, which further bound and recruited histone demethylase KDM3B to FAM111A promoter, leading to the reduction of the repressive histone mark H3K9me2 and transcriptional activation of FAM111A. The expression of FAM111A was positively correlated with the m(6)A level of FAM111A-DT, and the expression of methyltransferase complex, YTHDC1, and KDM3B in HCC tissues. Depletion of FAM111A largely attenuated the roles of m(6)A-modified FAM111A-DT in HCC. In summary, the m(6)A-modified FAM111A-DT/YTHDC1/KDM3B/FAM111A regulatory axis promoted HCC growth and represented a candidate therapeutic target for HCC.

Besides, existing learning systems cannot perceive children's emotional changes. They may also cause children's self-control and cognitive problems due to smart devices such as mobile phones and tablets. To tackle these issues, we propose an intelligent companion learning system to accompany children in learning English words, namely the Intelligent Augmented Reality Educator (IARE). The IARE realizes the perception and feedback of children's engagement through the intelligent agent (IA) module, and presents the humanized interaction based on projective Augmented Reality (AR). Specifically, IA perceives the children's learning engagement change and spelling status in real-time through our online lightweight temporal multiple instance attention module and character recognition module, based on which analyses the performance of the individual learning process and gives appropriate feedback and guidance. We allow children to interact with physical letters, thus avoiding the excessive interference of electronic devices. To test the efficacy of our system, we conduct a pilot study with 14 English learning children. The results show that our system can significantly improve children's intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy.

We analyze the asset allocations performed and test different portfolio strategies, such as maximum Sharpe ratio, minimum variance, and minimum conditional value at risk. Using international financial market indices, we specify the regular, drawable, and canonical vine copulas, such as the Gaussian, Student's t$$ t $$, Clayton, Frank, Joe, Gumbel, and mixed copulas, and analyze both in-sample and out-of-sample portfolio performances. Out-of-sample portfolio back-testing shows that vine copulas reduce portfolio risk better than the benchmark portfolio strategies and also better than simple multivariate copulas. Overall, we find that mixed vine copula models perform best with regard to risk reduction, both for the entire period 2001-2022 and during financial crises periods. Thus, a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric copula families works best in terms of portfolio risk reduction irrespective of the chosen optimization approach.

Oxide coatings can mitigate some of these problems and improve electrochemical performance. However, current coating strategies have low throughput, are expensive, and have limited applicability. In this article, we describe a low-cost and scalable strategy for applying oxide coatings on cathode materials. We report synergistic effects of these oxide coatings on the performance of aqueously processed cathodes in cells.

Here, by analyzing whole genome somatic mutation profiles in 73 centenarians and 51 younger controls in China, we found that centenarian genomes are characterized by a markedly skewed distribution of somatic mutations, with many genomic regions being specifically conserved but displaying a high function potential. This, together with the observed more efficient DNA repair ability in the long-lived individuals, supports the existence of key genomic regions for human survival during aging, with their integrity being of essential to human longevity.

Performance tests using the combined and four individual datasets employed at CIEDE2000 development showed that MLUV, MLUV1 and MLUV2 were significantly better than CIELUV. Using values of Standardized Residual Sum of Squares (CIE 217:2016) for predictions of the four individual datasets the ranking (from best to worst) was MLUV, MLUV2 and MLUV1, but for predictions of two ellipses datasets the ranking (from best to worst) was MLUV2, MLUV, and MLUV1. Overall, the MLUV2 space was found to be the best. Hence, it is expected that MLUV2 could be used for color specification and color difference evaluations, especially in industrial applications that depend on additive light mixing, such as color TV sets, video monitors, and lighting.

The goal of neuron modeling is to shoot a tradeoff between the biological meaningful and the implementation cost, so as to build a bridge between brain science knowledge and the brain-like neuromorphic computing. Unlike previous neuron models with linear static synapses, the focus of this research is to model neurons with relatively detailed nonlinear dynamic synapses. First, a universal soma-synapses neuron (SSN) is proposed. It contains a soma represented by a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses based on ion channels dynamics. Short-term plasticity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity linked to biological microscopic mechanisms are also presented in the synaptic models. Then, SSN is implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The performance of each component in SSN is analyzed and evaluated. Finally, a neural network SSNN composed of SSNs is deployed on FPGA and used for testing. Experimental results show that the stimulus-response characteristics of SSN are consistent with the electrophysiological test findings of biological neurons, and the activities of SSNN exhibit a promising prospect. We provide a prototype for embedded neuromorphic computing with a small number of relatively detailed neuron models.

However, owing to competition with hydrogen evolution, highly efficient CO2 reduction is mostly achieved with high CO selectivity in a narrow potential range, which is incompatible with a large cell voltage required for industrial-level CO2 reduction. Herein, we report an effective strategy to regulate CO2 reduction performances of single-atom Ni electrocatalysts over a broad potential window by engineering their pore structures (micropores, mesopores, or hierarchical pores with both micropores and mesopores). It is revealed that hierarchically pores can significantly promote CO2 reduction efficiency of single-atom Ni electrocatalysts. The hierarchically porous electrocatalyst achieves a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97.4% at -1.2 V (vs. RHE) and shows high FECO of >85% over a broad potential window from -0.7 to -1.7 V, much superior to electrocatalysts with other pore structures. More impressively, turnover frequency of the hierarchically porous electrocatalyst increases rapidly with increasing the applied potential and reaches 50,067 h(-1) at -1.7 V. Such CO2 electroreduction promotion could be attributed to a synergistic effect of micropores for enhancing CO2 adsorption and mesopores for facilitating rapid release of product bubbles, which significantly improves CO2 reduction and suppresses hydrogen evolution.

Around 500 million people suffer from mental disorders and are suffering from depression, and other mental-oriented disabilities. The new technological paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) were employed for detecting, and treating these disorders, which are being proposed, developed, and provide new capabilities to detect, assess and care for anxious people. These possibilities lead to several issues that are identified, which relate to patient privacy and confidentiality, security challenges such as data security, and the organization of IoT systems. To rectify these issues, we implement the Smart analysis of anxious people and their activities using Heterogeneous computing with virtual sensing. This system consists of the health application featuring the technique of the internet of things, heterogeneous computing, Cognitive Quasiperiodic motion, and Pentagonal tiling. This system introduces the internet of things-assisted smart analysis of anxiety against people with their activities. It performs the optimization analysis for improving the levels. The observational results focus on how to deal with the issues which were overcome in the analysis levels of the anxiety disorders, which show that time spent using the heterogeneous computing with the virtual sense proves more accuracy (92.3%), specificity (Degrees of anxiety severity by 20%), precision (Analysis of anxiety stress level by 65%), and recall (Anxiety chances percentile by 65.34%). The proposed model is simulated, and the outcomes are compared with the prevailing methods for evaluating the parameters like accuracy, end-end-end delay, energy consumption, network lifetime, and throughput.

T.; Kwasniok, Frank			A conditional decomposition of proper scores: quantifying the sources of information in a forecast	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						calibration; forecast verification; probabilistic forecasting; scoring rules; statistical postprocessing	BRIER SCORE; RELIABILITY; PREDICTION; RESOLUTION	Scoring rules condense all information regarding the performance of a probabilistic forecast into a single numerical value, providing a convenient framework with which to rank and compare competing prediction schemes objectively. Although scoring rules provide only a single measure of forecast accuracy, the expected score can be decomposed into components that each assess a distinct aspect of the forecast, such as its calibration or information content. Since these components could depend on several factors, it is useful to evaluate forecast performance under different circumstances; if a forecaster were able to identify situations in which their forecasts perform particularly poorly, then they could more easily develop their forecast strategy to account for these deficiencies. To help forecasters identify such situations, a novel decomposition of scores is introduced that quantifies conditional forecast biases, allowing for a more detailed examination of the sources of information in the forecast. From this, we claim that decompositions of proper scores provide a broad generalisation of the well-known analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework. The new decomposition is applied to the Brier score, which is then used to evaluate forecasts that the daily maximum temperature will exceed a range of thresholds, issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss). We demonstrate how the additional information provided by this decomposition can be used to improve the performance of these forecasts, by identifying appropriate auxiliary information to include within statistical postprocessing methods.

Here, inspired by the structure and function of rocket, a novel micromotor delivery system is presented with scaled-down rocket-like architecture and effervescent-tablets-derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating intestinal barrier. These rocket-inspired effervescent motors (RIEMs) are composed of sharp needle tips for both loading cargoes and efficient penetrating, and tail wings for loading effervescent powders and avoiding perforation. When exposed to a water environment, the effervescent fuel generates intensive CO2 bubbles to propel the RIEMs to move at high speed. Thus, the RIEMs with their sharp tip can inject into the surrounding mucosa for effective drug release. Furthermore, benefiting from their tail-wing design, perforation can be effectively avoided during the injection process, ensuring the safety of the RIEMs in gastrointestinal active delivery. Based on these advantages, it is demonstrated that the RIEMs can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood sugar glucose in a diabetic rabbit model. These features indicate that these RIEMs are versatile and valuable for clinical oral delivery of macromolecules.

Herein, the pyrene (Py)-N, N'-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-2,5,8,11-tetrakis(p-methyl-phenyl)-perylenediimide (MP) organic cocrystal is designed and fabricated via the solution self-assembly method, which demonstrates the NIR phosphorescence with a maximum peak at 730 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 34.2%. The singlet states with an intermediate energy level from MP molecules bridges singlet and triplet states of Py molecules, resulting in efficient NIR phosphorescence. Importantly, the loose packing pattern makes MP an excellent elementary molecule that can be assembled with a variety of aromatic molecules, from ternary to six-membered benzene rings and even larger benzene skeletons. In contrast to the limitations of traditional cocrystal systems, cocrystal engineering based on MP molecules with weak & pi;-& pi; interactions is no longer limited to the careful selection and collocation of molecular structures, uncertain assembly behavior, and unpredictable properties. This work holds considerable insights for the exploration of novel NIR phosphorescent materials via a universal strategy.

PSMA-based early detection of circumscribed local recurrences followed by hypofractionated high-precision stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) might yield long-term disease control at moderate rates of adverse effects. MethodsRetrospective analysis of 35 patients treated for locally recurrent prostate cancer between November 2012 and December 2021 with PSMA PET- and MRI-based robotic SBRT. ResultsThirty-five patients treated with local prostate cancer recurrence post surgery, post surgery, and adjuvant/salvage radiotherapy (RT) and after definitive RT. All but one patients had fractionated SBRT in 3-5 fractions. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 52.2 months for all patients and 52.2 months in the radical prostatectomy (RPE) group, 31.2 months in the RPE + RT group and not reached in the RT group. The most common event was increased urinary frequency grade 1-2. 54.3% of all patients had no acute and 79.4% no late toxicity during follow-up. DiscussionOur PFS of 52.2 months (RPE), 31.2 months (RPE + RT) and not reached (RT) compares favorably with published data. This method constitutes a valid alternative to morbidity-prone invasive approaches or palliative systemic therapy.

However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p-type self-doping behaviors. This work reports an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high-quality Sn-Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single-junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn-Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn-Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward-shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow-bandgap Sn-Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping have considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single-junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady-state efficiency of 25.33%) for two-terminal all-perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single-junction narrow-bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

This study modeled up to 20 years of BP patterns representative of midlife by using BPV and cumulative BP, then examined their associations with development of dementia in later life. METHODSFor 3201 individuals from the Framingham Heart Study, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association between long-term BP patterns during midlife and the development of dementia (ages & GE; 65). RESULTSAfter adjusting for covariates, every quartile increase in midlife cumulative BP was associated with a sequential increase in the risk of developing dementia (e.g., highest quartile of cumulative systolic blood pressure had approximately 2.5-fold increased risk of all-cause dementia). BPV was not significantly associated with dementia. DISCUSSIONFindings suggest that cumulative BP over the course of midlife predicts risk of dementia in later life.Long-term blood pressure (BP) patterns are strong indicators of vascular risks.Cumulative BP and BP variability (BPV) were used to reflect BP patterns across midlife.High cumulative BP in midlife is associated with increased dementia risk.Visit-to-visit BPV was not associated with the onset of dementia.

The rate of hydrogen evolution reaction by nanoparticles composed of various donor:acceptor blend ratio compositions is quantitatively measured, and it is found that the most active blend ratio displays a hydrogen quantum yield of 0.83% per photon. Moreover, it is found that nanoparticle photocatalytic activity corresponds directly to charge generation, and that nanoparticles have 3x more long-lived accumulated charges relative to bulk samples of the same material composition. These results suggest that, under the current reaction conditions, with & AP;3x solar flux, catalytic activity by the nanoparticles is limited by the concentration of electrons and holes in operando and not a finite number of active surface sites or the catalytic rate at the interface. This provides a clear design goal for the next generation of efficient photocatalytic nanoparticles.

Kristina			The gender of bruising: A critical literature review on gender in boxing	SOCIOLOGY COMPASS			English	Review						boxing; critical review; gender; gender identities; organisation; qualitative analysis	BOXERS; WOMEN; DIVERSITY; ART	This article provides a critical review of the scholarship on gender in boxing since the formal recognition of women's boxing internationally in 1994. The article is divided into three parts, each addressing a different aspect of the relationship between gender and boxing. The first part discusses the beginnings of boxing scholarship that mostly focussed on men and masculinity, the second part explores the research on boxing since the inclusion of female boxing in international competitions and examines organizational aspects of boxing, and the last part outlines the scholarship that explores gender identities in boxing. The review is based on qualitative textual analysis and attempts to identify gaps in the scholarship, providing suggestions for future research directions. Overall, the article argues that while the scholarship on gender in boxing is saturated, there are still a few areas that would benefit from further research. These are studies on the relationship between volunteering, refereeing, heterosexuality, and gender in boxing.	[Orszaghova, M. A.

Robust and protective immune responses induced by heterologous prime-boost vaccination with DNA-protein dimeric RBD vaccines for COVID-19	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY			English	Article						COVID-19; DNA vaccine; heterologous prime-boost immunization; immune responses; SARS-CoV-2; ZF2001	SARS-COV-2; IMMUNIZATION; ANTIBODIES; IMMUNOGENICITY; STRATEGY	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic posed great impacts on public health. To fight against the pandemic, robust immune responses induced by vaccination are indispensable. Previously, we developed a subunit vaccine adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide, ZF2001, based on the dimeric tandem-repeat RBD immunogen, which has been approved for clinical use. This dimeric RBD design was also explored as an mRNA vaccine. Both showed potent immunogenicity. In this study, a DNA vaccine candidate encoding RBD-dimer was designed. The humoral and cellular immune responses induced by homologous and heterologous prime-boost approaches with DNA-RBD-dimer and ZF2001 were assessed in mice. Protection efficacy was studied by the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We found that the DNA-RBD-dimer vaccine was robustly immunogenic. Priming with DNA-RBD-dimer followed by ZF2001 boosting induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than homologous vaccination with either DNA-RBD-dimer or ZF2001, elicited polyfunctional cellular immunity with a T(H)1-biased polarization, and efficiently protected mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. This study demonstrated the robust and protective immune responses induced by the DNA-RBD-dimer candidate and provided a heterologous prime-boost approach with DNA-RBD-dimer and ZF2001.

Cardiac Transplantation: Physiology and Natural History of the Transplanted Heart	COMPREHENSIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; PRIMARY GRAFT FAILURE; PEAK OXYGEN-UPTAKE; DOBUTAMINE STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY; HIGH-INTENSITY EXERCISE; MYOCARDIAL BLOOD-FLOW; ANTI-HLA ANTIBODIES; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; EXTRACORPOREAL MEMBRANE-OXYGENATION	Heart transplantation (HT) is one of the prodigious achievements in modern medicine and remains the cornerstone in the treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. Advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppression, organ preservation, infection control, and allograft surveillance have improved short-and long-term outcomes thereby contributing to greater clinical success of HT. However, prolonged allograft and patient survival following HT are still largely restricted by the development of late complications, including allograft rejection, infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), and malignancy. The introduction of mTOR inhibitors early after HT has demonstrated multiple protective effects against CAV progression, renal dysfunction, and tumorigenesis. Therefore, several HT programs increasingly use mTOR inhibitors with partial or complete withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) in stable HT patients to reduce complications risk and improve long-term outcomes. Furthermore, despite a substantial improvement in exercise capacity and health-related quality of life after HT as compared to advanced heart failure patients, most HT recipients remain with a 30% to 50% lower peak oxygen consumption (Vo2) than that of age-matched healthy subjects. Several factors, including alterations in central hemodynamics, HT-related complications and alterations in the musculoskeletal system, and peripheral physiological abnormalities, presumably contribute to the reduced exercise capacity following HT. Cardiac denervation and subsequent loss of sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation are responsible for various physiological alterations in the cardiovascular system, which contributes to restricted exercise tolerance. Restoration of cardiac innervation may improve exercise capacity and quality of life, but the reinnervation process is only partial even several years after HT. Multiple studies have shown that aerobic and strengthening exercise interventions improve exercise capacity by increasing maximal heart rate, chronotropic response, and peak Vo2 after HT. Novel exercise modalities, such as high-intensity interval training (HIT), have been proven as safe and effective for further improvement in exercise capacity, including among de novo HT recipients. Further developments have recently emerged, including donor heart preservation techniques, noninvasive CAV and rejection surveillance methods, and improvements in immunosuppressive therapies, all aiming at increasing donor availability and improving late survival after HT. & COPY; 2023 American Physiological Society	[Asleh, Rabea; Alnsasra, Hilmi; Villavicencio, Mauricio A.; Daly, Richard C.; Kushwaha, Sudhir S.] Mayo Clin, Dept Cardiovasc Dis, Rochester, MN 55902 USA; [Asleh, Rabea] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Hadassah Univ, Heart Inst, Fac Med,Med Ctr, Jerusalem, Israel	Mayo Clinic; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hadassah University Medical Center	Kushwaha, SS (corresponding author), Mayo Clin, Dept Cardiovasc Dis, Rochester, MN 55902 USA.	kushwaha.sudhir@mayo.edu							471	0	0	3	3	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA	2040-4603			COMPR PHYSIOL	Compr.

Considerations on effort, precision and accuracy for long-term monitoring of African lions (<i>Panthera leo</i>), when using Bayesian spatial explicit capture-recapture models, in fenced protected areas	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Bayesian spatial explicit capture-recapture; fenced protected area; home range; population density; sampling effort; sex ratio	NATIONAL-PARK; SOUTH-AFRICA; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; CARNIVORES; INFERENCE; RESERVES; PREY	Intensive management is frequently required in fenced wildlife areas to reduce deleterious effects of isolation. Decisions on how best to manage such wildlife are ideally informed by regular and reliable estimates of spatiotemporal fluctuations in population size and structure. However, even in small, fenced areas, it is difficult and costly to regularly monitor key species using advanced methods. This is particularly the case for large carnivores, which typically occur at low density and are elusive yet are central to management decision-making due to their top-down effects in ecosystems and attracting tourism. In this study, we aimed to provide robust estimates of population parameters for African lions (Panthera leo) and use the data to inform a resource-efficient long-term monitoring programme. To achieve this, we used unstructured spatial sampling to collect data on lions in Pilanesberg National Park, a small (similar to 550 km(2)) fenced protected area in South Africa. We used Bayesian spatial capture-recapture models to estimate density, abundance, sex ratio and home range size of lions over the age of 1 year. Finally, to provide guidance on resource requirements for regular monitoring, we rarefied our empirical data set incrementally and analysed the subsets. Lion density was estimated to be 8.8 per 100 km(2) (posterior SD = 0.6), which was lower than anticipated by park management. Sex ratio was estimated close to parity (0.9 female:1.male, consistent with emerging evidence in fenced lion populations, yet discordant with unfenced populations, which are usually similar to 2 female:1 male in healthy, source populations. Our rarefied data suggest that a minimum of 4000 km search effort needs to be invested in future monitoring to obtain accurate and precise estimates, while assuming similar detection rates. This study demonstrates an important utility of Bayesian spatial explicit capture-recapture methods for obtaining robust estimates of lion densities	[Ball, Isabella A. A.; Marneweck, David G.

Materials and Methods: This study included patients who underwent tooth transplantation between April 2004 and December 2021. A total of 1654 premolars were transplanted into 1243 patients. Tooth mobility, oral hygiene and periodontal parameters were clinically evaluated. Intraoral radiographs were used to evaluate pulpal and periodontal healing, and root formation. The cumulative survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Data were subdivided into three groups based on the stage of root development and patient age. The mean age at surgery was 14.5 years. The main indication for transplantation was agenesis, followed by trauma and other indications, such as impacted or malformed teeth. A total of 11 premolars were lost during the study period. The overall survival and success rates in the immature premolar group after an observation period of 10 years were 99.7% and 99.4%, respectively. High survival and success rates (95.7% and 95.5%, respectively) were also observed when fully developed premolars were transplanted into the posterior region of adolescents. In adults, the success rate after 10-year follow-up is 83.3%. Conclusions: Transplantation of premolars with developing and fully developed roots is a predictable treatment modality.

ITech Team	Who prefers what? Correlates of preferences for next-generation HIV prevention products among a national US sample of young men who have sex with men	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						men who have sex with men; adolescents; HIV prevention; pre-exposure prophylaxis; conjoint experiment; product preferences	PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; PREP AWARENESS; ADOLESCENTS; ACCEPTABILITY; MICROBICIDES; ADHERENCE; SAFETY; WOMEN; RISK	IntroductionPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been available for young people for over a decade, yet only & SIM;15% of young people in the United States with indications for PrEP have a prescription for it. Next-generation PrEP modalities may address some of the challenges of daily oral PrEP. However, preferences for these products are unknown. MethodsFrom October 2020 to June 2021, we conducted an online survey of 737 cisgender, young men who have sex with men (age 15-24 years) without HIV across the United States who reported same-sex attraction or consensual sex with another man in the past 6 months. Participants completed a conjoint experiment comparing daily oral pills, event-driven oral pills, event-driven rectal douches, intramuscular injections, intravenous broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) infusions and subcutaneous implants. Participants ranked the products from most to least preferred. Exploded logit models examined the association between ranked preferences of PrEP modalities and socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. ResultsParticipants' mean age was 21 years (SD = 2.3), and 56% identified as White. Nineteen percent were currently taking daily oral PrEP, and another 9% had previously taken it. Participants prioritized efficacy, absence of side effects and costs in the conjoint analyses. Daily oral PrEP had the highest preference ranking, followed by event-driven oral (OR = 0.89, p = 0.058), injectable (OR = 0.83, p = 0.005), implant (OR = 0.48, p < 0.0001), bnAb infusions (OR = 0.38, p < 0.0001) and rectal douches (OR = 0.24, p < 0.0001). There were differences in PrEP preferences across age, insurance status, sexual behaviour, PrEP use history, HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing history, and STI diagnoses (omnibus tests: p < 0.05). Participants also provided reasons for selecting their top product choice: ease of use for those who chose daily oral (99%) and daily event-driven (98.5%); feel more protected against HIV for those who chose injectable (95.4%) and implants (100%); not worrying about forgetting to take it for those who chose bnAbs (93.8%); and being able to stop taking it when they want for those who chose rectal douche (90.9%). ConclusionsNext-generation modalities were less likely to be preferred over daily oral PrEP, with differences in the magnitude by socio-demographic and behavioural characteristics. Given the low uptake of daily oral PrEP, end-users' preferences for and concerns about PrEP products must be understood to ensure high acceptability and penetration.

J	Cerda, DZ; Urquijo, LG				Cerda, Daniela Zavando; Urquijo, Laura Gomez			Improving the protection of migrant workers with work histories in the European Union and Ibero-America: Enhancing the coordination of international social security instruments	INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY REVIEW			English	Article						migrant worker; social security administration; ILO Convention; social security legislation; European Union; Latin America; international		Migration affects almost every nation, emphasizing the need to guarantee social security rights for all migrants and their families. This article focuses on the rights of workers who migrate between the countries of the European Union (EU) and the Ibero-American community. In the EU, social security systems are increasingly coordinated through Regulation No. 883/2004 and its Implementing Regulation No. 987/2009. In the Ibero-American community, coordination is sought through the Ibero-American Social Security Convention. Despite convergence between these two international instruments, coordination is still lacking between them. This article presents a comparative analysis to articulate the necessary mechanisms to guarantee coordination, to respect the social security rights of migrant workers. We focus on the cooperation and coordination between regional as well as national systems, specifically looking at the need for and aims of a rapprochement between these two major international coordination instruments to provide greater EU-Ibero-American cooperation. Finally, the importance of promoting greater international cooperation in social security policy and administration is highlighted, to engender the adequate protection of the rights as well as the free movement of migrant workers.

Alternative articulations of transnational religious networks	GLOBAL NETWORKS-A JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL AFFAIRS			English	Article						digital technology; institution; migration; religious network; transnational religion; travelling faith	PLACE; POWER	A growing body of scholarship on transnational religion is grounded within the analytical framework of the religion-migration relationship and has highlighted migrant individuals and groups as main players in forging religious networking. This ignores a wide range of alternative drivers that are forceful in the (re)making of transnational religious networks. In this introduction of the special issue, we therefore open a collection of nine articles which contribute to alternative articulations of transnational religious networks. In particular, our contributors introduce three alternative drivers - ideas, institutions and digital technologies - in (re)producing religious mobilities, connections and networks across nation borders. At the same time, they offer fascinating insights into the diversified ways alternative actors and channels weave together religious migrants' imaginations, practices and experiences, formulating new, complex forms of religious (re)production in a transnational world. This special issue also highlights the creativity, flexibility and vitality of Asian religions in the 21st century modernity.

As the DS population continues to grow and most of those with DS live beyond puberty, early-onset health problems have become apparent. However, the cellular landscape and molecular alterations have not been thoroughly studied. MethodsThis study utilized single-cell resolution techniques to examine DS in humans and mice, spanning seven distinct organs. A total of 71 934 mouse and 98 207 human cells were analyzed to uncover the molecular alterations occurring in different cell types and organs related to DS, specifically starting from the fetal stage. Additionally, SA-& beta;-Gal staining, western blot, and histological study were employed to verify the alterations. ResultsIn this study, we firstly established the transcriptomic profile of the mammalian DS, deciphering the cellular map and molecular mechanism. Our analysis indicated that DS cells across various types and organs experienced senescence stresses from as early as the fetal stage. This was marked by elevated SA-& beta;-Gal activity, overexpression of cell cycle inhibitors, augmented inflammatory responses, and a loss of cellular identity. Furthermore, we found evidence of mitochondrial disturbance, an increase in ribosomal protein transcription, and heightened apoptosis in fetal DS cells. This investigation also unearthed a regulatory network driven by an HSA21 gene, which leads to genome-wide expression changes. ConclusionThe findings from this study offer significant insights into the molecular alterations that occur in DS, shedding light on the pathological processes underlying this disorder. These results can potentially guide future research and treatment development for DS.

In a forest landscape, the near-ground temperatures may change due to management activities that alter forest density. As a result of such management activities, current species distributions and performances might not only be affected by current microclimates, but also by past conditions due to time-lagged responses.Location: Sweden.Methods: We examined the effects of past and current microclimates on the distributions and performances of two northern, cold-favoured, and two southern, warm-favoured, plant species in 53 managed forest sites. Each pair was represented by one vascular plant and one bryophyte species. We used temperature logger data and predictions from microclimate models based on changes in basal area to relate patterns of occurrence, abundance, and reproduction to current and past microclimate.Results: The two northern species were generally favoured by microclimates that were currently cold, characterised by later snowmelt and low accumulated heat over the growing season. In contrast, the two southern species were generally favoured by currently warm microclimates, characterised by high accumulated heat over the growing season. Species generally had higher abundance in sites with a preferred microclimate both in the past and present, and lower abundance than expected from current conditions, if the past microclimate had changed from warm to cold or vice versa, indicating time-lags in abundance patterns of the species.Conclusions: Our results show a potential importance of past and present microclimate heterogeneity for the co-existence of species with different temperature preferences in the same landscape and highlight the possibility to manage microclimates to mitigate climate change impacts on forest biodiversity.

The genetic basis of conspicuous coloration in the Guadeloupean anole: Evolution by sexual and ecological selection	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						adaptation; Anolis marmoratus; cluster of differentiation 36; functional genomics; high-pressure liquid chromatography; melanophilin	SPECIES RECOGNITION; GENOMIC LANDSCAPE; DEWLAP COLOR; SPECIATION; DIVERGENCE; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; DIFFERENTIATION; SIGNALS; LIZARD	Understanding how natural selection acts on the genome and contributes to the process of speciation is a primary aim of the study of evolution. Here we used natural variation in two subspecies of the Guadeloupean anole (Anolis marmoratus ssp.), from the island of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles, to explore the genomic basis of adaptation and speciation in Anolis lizards. These subspecies inhabit distinct ecological environments and display marked differences in adult male color and pattern. We sequenced the complete genomes of 20 anoles, 10 from each subspecies, at 1.4x coverage. We used genome-wide scans of population differentiation, allele frequency spectrum, and linkage disequilibrium to characterize the genomic architecture within and between the subspecies. While most of the genome was undifferentiated, we observed five large divergent regions. Within these regions we identified blocks, 5 kb pairs in length, enriched for fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms. These blocks encompass 97 genes, two of which are candidate pigmentation genes. One is melanophilin (mlph), which helps transport melanosomes within melanocytes. The other is a cluster of differentiation 36 (cd36), which regulates carotenoid pigment sequestration. We used high-pressure liquid chromatography to confirm that carotenoid pigments are significantly more abundant in the conspicuous orange-pigmented skin of male A. m. marmoratus suggesting that cd36 may be regulating pigment deposition in this tissue. We identified for the first time a carotenoid gene that is a potential target of divergent sexual selection and may be contributing to the early stages of speciation in Anolis lizards.

The World Health Organization stated that 1.6 million deaths worldwide were caused by contact with chemicals and toxins in 2019. In the same year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that natural toxins caused 3960 deaths. Myrtus communis, also known as common Myrtle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. Myrtle has been traditionally used to treat diarrhea, inflammation, bleeding, headache, pulmonary and skin diseases. This review was performed to assess Myrtle's protective and therapeutic efficacy against various chemical, natural, and radiational noxious. Multiple databases such as PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus were investigated without publication time limitation. Recent studies have demonstrated its potential as a protective agent against both natural and chemical toxins. One of Myrtle's most significant protective properties is its high antioxidant content. Studies have shown that the antioxidant properties of Myrtle can protect against harmful substances such as heavy metals, pesticides, and other environmental toxins. Additionally, Myrtle has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce the damage caused by long-term exposure to toxins. The anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of Myrtle have also proven effective in alleviating gastrointestinal conditions such as gastric ulcers.

However, little is known about the function of RUNX1T1 in the skeletal muscle development. Here, we assessed the impact of RUNX1T1 on the proliferation and myogenic differentiation of goat primary myoblasts (GPMs). It was observed that RUNX1T1 is highly expressed during the early stages of myogenic differentiation and the fetal stage. Moreover, the knockdown of RUNX1T1 promotes the proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis of GPMs. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that significantly differentially expressed genes in RUNX1T1 knockdown cells were enriched in the calcium signaling pathway. Additionally, we discovered that RUNX1T1 regulates alternative splicing (AS) events involved in myogenesis. We also show that silencing RUNX1T1 blocked the Ca2+-CAMK signaling pathway and reduced the expression levels of muscle-specific isoforms of recombinant rho associated coiled coil containing crotein kinase 2 (ROCK2) during myogenic differentiation, partially explaining why RUNX1T1 deficiency leads to the impairment of myotube formation. These findings suggest that RUNX1T1 is a novel regulator of myogenic differentiation that regulates the calcium signaling pathway and AS of ROCK2. Overall, our results highlight the critical role of RUNX1T1 in myogenesis and broaden our understanding of myogenic differentiation.

Investigating the effects of 7-ketocholesterol on retinal pigment epithelium bioenergetics	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						7-ketocholesterol; age related macular degeneration; cellular bioenergetics; retinal pigment epithelium	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA DAMAGE; LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; CELLS; DEGENERATION; ACTIVATION; STRESS; RPE	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is associated with formation of drusen, clusters of lipids, and oxidized lipid products under the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). 7-Ketocholesterol (7KC) is a form of oxidized cholesterol present in drusen and is hypothesized to play a role in AMD pathogenesis. The association of 7KC with cellular toxicity and inflammation, key elements of AMD pathology, has been demonstrated. However, the effects of 7KC on altering RPE bioenergetics, a potentially important pathologic process in AMD, are unclear. Herein, we describe the effects of non-lethal doses of 7KC on the bioenergetics and phenotype of RPE cells in culture. Metabolic analysis demonstrated a significant dose-dependent increase in total ATP production rates that was driven primarily by an increase in glycolysis. The increase in glycolysis was accompanied by an increase in glucose uptake and increased expression of hexokinase 1. Increased levels of Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 20 and NADH:Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit S1, Succinate dehydrogenase, Ubiquinol-Cytochrome C Reductase Core Protein 2, Cytochrome C Oxidase II, and ATP synthase subunit beta, proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), were also seen. However, specific electron transport chain activity remained unchanged. 7KC-treated cells also demonstrated a change in cellular morphology with decreased expression of epithelial markers. In summary, 7KC has significant effects on the bioenergetics and morphology of RPE cells reflective of findings seen in clinical AMD.

J	Ezure, T				Ezure, Tomonobu			Perception gap of aged facial appearance; self-perception is younger than actual status due to angle of viewing	SKIN RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						face; facial aging; perception gap; recognition; sagging	CHEEK; FOREHEAD; GENDER; OLD	BackgroundFacial morphology changes with aging, resulting in an aged appearance that is a great matter of concern for people. However, it is not clear whether people perceive their own facial appearance accurately, in part because there are few methods to evaluate this. AimThe aim of this study is firstly to establish an evaluation system for the perception gap of aged facial appearance between the self-perceived status and the actual status, and then to use this evaluation system to quantify the perception gap and to clarify the mechanism of this gap MethodThirty-six middle-aged female volunteers were first asked to rate their facial aging-related morphology according to a 6-grade set of photos taken at a 45 & DEG; angle from the front showing progressive stages of sagging severity, without looking either in a mirror or at photos of themselves (self- or "subjective" perception). Then they were shown photos of their face taken at a 45 & DEG; angle from the front, and asked again to rate their sagging grade based on these photos ("objective" rating). In addition, facial photos taken from several angles from the front to the side were evaluated for sagging severity by trained evaluators. ResultsThis system for analyzing perception gap revealed that the self-perception of aged appearance was significantly younger than the actual situation in three facial areas, namely the cheek, around the eyes and the facial contour, and the gap corresponded to an age difference of as much as 8 years in middle-aged females. Trained evaluators found that the severity of sagging judged from photos taken from a frontal direction was significantly less than in photos of the same subject taken from side angles. This suggests that recognition of sagging is more difficult from the front, which is the direction from which people view their own face in daily life. Indeed, viewing photos taken from the side, a rare viewing angle of one's own face, increased the motivation to improve aged appearance in more than 70% of the subjects in a questionnaire survey. ConclusionThe results suggest that people perceive their own facial appearance as less aged than it actually is. The reason for this appears to be that viewing from the front, the usual viewing angle of one's own face in daily life, results in lower perceived sagging severity, likely due to reduced depth perception.

In this study, two microcosm experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of carbon-iron coupling on N2O emissions, and the underlying mechanisms were verified using quantitative denitrification functional genes (nirS, nirK, nosZI and nosZII) and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that ferrihydrite (iron) significantly promoted N2O-N emissions (p < 0.05) after adding ammonium nitrogen, while glucose (carbon) significantly inhibited N2O-N emissions (p < 0.05). Carbon-iron coupling significantly decreased N2O-N emissions (p < 0.05) but did not affect soil total nitrogen loss and increased nitrogen (N-2) emissions. After adding high concentrations of acetylene (10% C2H2), the N2O-N emissions from carbon-iron coupling treatment increased significantly from 6.4 to 11.9 mg N kg-1 (p < 0.05), which confirmed that the carbon-iron coupling reduced the N2O emissions by promoting the conversion of N2O to N-2. The mechanisms behind carbon-iron coupling promoting complete denitrification and reducing N2O emissions were attributed to glucose promoting iron reduction and carbon-iron coupling enhancing the abundance of nosZI (42.7%) and nosZII (16.6%).

Fraction skill score (FSS) and method for object-based diagnostic evaluation (MODE) verification techniques were applied to verify how well the models predict the high-impact event and to demonstrate how these tools can support operational forecasting. Ensemble model forecasts at a convective scale from UK Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) and a one-way nested weather research and forecasting (WRF) model were compared with the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG GPM). The purpose is to examine skills of improved model resolution and ensemble in reproducing rainfall forecasts on useful scales and how the skill varies with spatial scale. WRF 2 and 6 km model forecasts show comparable skill at smaller grid scales. The skill of MetUM improves dramatically when the verification statistics are applied to the ensemble mean of the binary fields of the individual member forecast. The object-based analysis reveals a similar structure as observed, although displaced eastwards. Most improvement occurred for heavier rainfall events associated with the passage of the AEW. WRF 6 km compares reasonably well with WRF 2 km in terms of shape and structure of rainfall underscoring the ability of the model to reasonably represent convection at 6 km horizontal resolution. The ensemble members in MetUM explicitly reproduce convection at 4 km resolution but are displaced at about 166 km behind observed rainfall.

The self-decoupling mechanism is based on the weak-field region formed by the T-shaped probe feed and the radiating patch of the antenna element itself. When another identical antenna element is placed in the weak-field region, high isolation between the two elements can be achieved without adding extra decoupling structures. To validate the decoupling mechanism, a dual-element antenna array is initially built and an isolation level of better than 30 dB is achieved over the impedance band of 3.3-3.66 GHz with an element spacing of 0.53 & lambda;(0). Next, a four-element multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear antenna array is presented to further verify the decoupling method and good isolation performance is also obtained, which demonstrates that the proposed designs are good candidates for 5G MIMO applications.

Facilitation by pioneer trees and herbivore exclusion allow regeneration of woody species in the semiarid ecosystem of central Chile	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						herbivory; mediterranean-type ecosystems; plant-plant interactions; recruitment; regeneration; restoration	SEEDLING SURVIVAL; DEER EXCLUSION; SCLEROPHYLLOUS FORESTS; NATURAL REGENERATION; PLANT INTERACTIONS; VEGETATION; RESTORATION; RECRUITMENT; SHRUBS; CONSERVATION	Questions: Facilitation by pioneer plants and herbivore exclusion may contribute to plant regeneration and restoration of degraded semiarid ecosystems. In this study we evaluated the main and interactive effects of the exclusion of large and medium-sized mammal herbivores and the presence of the pioneer tree Vachellia caven on natural regeneration of woody species in degraded savannas. Location: Two localities of the native sclerophyllous forest of central Chile Methods: Twelve 30 x 40 m exclosures and twelve non-exclosure areas located near native forests were established in savannas of V. caven in each locality. Regeneration coming from seeds and resprouts was sampled both under the canopy of V. caven and without canopy in each exclosure and non-excluded area. Results: After seven years, species richness and density of older regeneration (0.5-2 m high) were positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven. No significant interaction between herbivore exclusion and V. caven was observed. Younger regeneration (<0.5 m high) was positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven only in some years with almost no interactive effect. Conclusions: The exclusion of large and medium-sized exotic herbivores and facilitation by pioneer trees are complementary for regeneration. The variable but permanent presence of younger and older regeneration within exclosures and under V. caven during the experiment may lead to an increase of density and diversity of adult plants and recovery of the native forest. However, this process may be slow due to other limiting factors, for instance, reduced precipitation associated with climate change.

Deletion of the <i>Npr3</i> gene increases severity of acute lung injury in obese mice	PULMONARY CIRCULATION			English	Article						atrial natriuretic peptide; lung inflammation; natriuretic peptide receptor C; obesity	ATRIAL-NATRIURETIC-PEPTIDE; BODY-MASS INDEX; CLEARANCE; MORTALITY; BIOLOGY	Previous studies have shown that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) attenuates agonist-induced pulmonary edema and that this effect may be mediated in part by the ANP clearance receptor, natriuretic peptide receptor-C (NPR-C). Obesity has been associated with lower plasma ANP levels due to increased expression of NPR-C, and with decreased severity of acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, we hypothesized that increased expression of NPR-C may attenuate ALI severity in obese populations. To test this, we examined ALI in Npr3 wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice fed normal chow (NC) or high-fat diets (HFD). After 12 weeks, ALI was induced with intra-tracheal administration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 103 (PA103) or saline. ALI severity was determined by lung wet-to-dry ratio (W/D) along with measurement of cell count, protein levels from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on whole lung to measure cytokine/chemokine and Npr3 mRNA expression. ANP levels were measured from plasma. PA103 caused ALI as determined by significant increases in W/D, BALF protein concentration, and whole lung cytokine/chemokine expression. PA103 increased Npr3 expression in the lungs of wild-type (WT) mice regardless of diet. There was a nonsignificant trend toward increased Npr3 expression in the lungs of WT mice fed HFD versus NC. No differences in ALI were seen between Npr3 knockout (KO) mice and WT-fed NC, but Npr3 KO mice fed HFD had a significantly greater W/D and BALF protein concentration than WT mice fed HFD. These findings support the hypothesis that Npr3 may help protect against ALI in obesity.

Operationalizing a Free Flap Program for Head and Neck Reconstruction at a Veterans Affairs Hospital	OTO OPEN			English	Article						30-day readmission; free flap; head and neck cancer; microvascular reconstruction; Veteran	POSTOPERATIVE RADIATION-THERAPY; FREE TISSUE TRANSFER; OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER; QUALITY; TIME; INITIATION; CARCINOMA; LARYNGEAL; SURGEONS; OUTCOMES	Objectives. We aimed to operationalize a head and neck microvascular free tissue transfer (MVFTT) program at a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital with the emphasis on initiating radiotherapy within 6 weeks of surgery for cancer patients and minimizing readmissions.Study Design. Case series.Setting. Tertiary care VA hospital.Methods. A retrospective analysis was performed on consecutive head and neck MVFTT patients from May 1, 2017 and April 30, 2022. Demographics, patient and disease characteristics, per-operative data and postoperative outcomes were recorded from the electronic medical record. We sought to compare our rate of 30-day readmissions with those published in the literature.Results. One hundred and forty-one procedures were performed in the queried timeframe. Eighty-four percent (119) were performed after oncologic resections and 16% (22) were for nononcologic procedures. The rate of total flap loss was <1% and the rate of partial flap loss was 3.5%. For mucosal defects, the fistula rate was 2.3%. The rate of return to the OR for any reason within 30 days was 7.8%. The 30-day readmission rate was 6.4% while the rates reported in the literature range from 13% to 20%. One hundred and four patients required postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) and 76% started PORT within 42 days of surgery.Conclusion.

This study used a zero-inflated Poisson regression model and found that the geographical rotation of local officials significantly increased cross-city mergers and acquisitions (M & As) of enterprises. The impact of local officials' geographical rotation on M & As was more pronounced under certain conditions. These conditions included: (i) when officials were transferred from cities with a higher development level to cities with a lower development level; (ii) when the outflow cities were municipalities directly governed by the central government, provincial capitals, or separately listed cities; (iii) when the transfers of officials occurred within the same province; (iv) when the transfers took place before 2012; and (v) when the transfers happened in the years following significant central government conferences, which provided strong political incentives for M & As.

In this work, intercropping between the halophyte Arthrocaulon macrostachyum and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum var. Sargento) was studied in both plant species using comparative mass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to metabolic pathway predictions. A significant number of changes in metabolites was observed in the halophyte. In terms of alteration of specific metabolic pathways, intercropping conditions stimulated sugar and starch metabolisms in tomato, whereas in the halophyte, intercropping mainly altered amino acid-related pathways. In addition, arginine and proline metabolism were commonly affected in both tomato and halophyte plants. Moreover, metabolomic changes were associated with physiological alterations in tomato. In this sense, mild oxidative stress was induced in intercropped tomato plants, which, in turn, could trigger signaling events leading to plant adjustment to intercropping conditions. This study represents the first approach toward understanding intercropping interactions at the metabolome level and its effect on plant physiology, opening up prospects for further characterization of this crop cultivation strategy.

Here, we constructed influenza-specific IgG landscapes and determined baseline concentrations of cytokines typically associated with chronic inflammation in older adults (TNF-& alpha;, IL-10, IL-6, and IFN-& gamma;) in 30 high and 29 low influenza vaccine responders (HR and LR, respectively). In a background of high H3 antibody titers, vaccine-specific H3, but not H1, antibody titers were boosted in LRs to titers comparable to HRs. Pre-vaccination concentrations of IL-10 were higher in LRs compared with HRs and inversely correlated with titers of pre-existing influenza antibodies. Baseline TNF-& alpha; concentrations were positively correlated with fold-increases in antibody titers in HRs. Our findings indicate that baseline inflammatory status is an important determinant for generating post-vaccination hemagglutinin-inhibition antibodies in older adults, and IgG responses can be boosted in the context of high pre-existing immunity.

Anti-Ribonucleoprotein antibodies were found to be present, and gadolinium-based cardiac MRI showed non-vascular subendocardial enhancement with diffuse symmetrical thickening of the left ventricular wall. A diagnosis of Mixed connective tissue disease with secondary cardiac amyloidosis was thus made, and the patient was successfully managed with intravenous cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and other supportive measures. Although extremely rare, this case shows that secondary cardiac amyloidosis should be considered while managing patients with MCTD.

Forced-handover is a concept of forcing edge mobile stations to neighbour relay stations for both energy saving and SINR improvement of the network. The proposed energy saving scheme can be applied to not only micro sleep and macro sleep mode but also turning off the BSs. The performances of BS sleep mode schemes is investigated in various environments such as small cell network and different user distributions.

This study is the first to report nanoparticle (NP) uptake into LLPS droplets. Fluorescent dye, Nile red loaded polystyrene NPs (NR-PSt NPs) uptake into model LLPS droplets consisting of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and poly-L-lysine (PLL) was visualized using fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence imaging showed that the LLPS droplets had a quick NP uptake behavior. Furthermore, temperature changes (4-37 & DEG;C) significantly affected the NP uptake behavior of the LLPS droplets. Moreover, the NP-incorporated droplets displayed high stability under strong ionic strength conditions (1 M NaCl). ATP measurements displayed that ATP was released from the NP-incorporated droplets, indicating that the weakly negatively charged ATP molecules and strongly negatively charged NPs were exchanged, which resulted in the high stability of the LLPS droplets. These fundamental findings will contribute to the LLPS studies using various NPs.

Implementation of deep learning in liver pathology optimizes diagnosis of benign lesions and adenocarcinoma metastasis	CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						artificial intelligence; deep learning; liver metastasis; liver pathology; personalized medicine	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; CANCER	IntroductionDifferentiation of histologically similar structures in the liver, including anatomical structures, benign bile duct lesions, or common types of liver metastases, can be challenging with conventional histological tissue sections alone. Accurate histopathological classification is paramount for the diagnosis and adequate treatment of the disease. Deep learning algorithms have been proposed for objective and consistent assessment of digital histopathological images. Materials and methodsIn the present study, we trained and evaluated deep learning algorithms based on the EfficientNetV2 and ResNetRS architectures to discriminate between different histopathological classes. For the required dataset, specialized surgical pathologists annotated seven different histological classes, including different non-neoplastic anatomical structures, benign bile duct lesions, and liver metastases from colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a large patient cohort. Annotation resulted in a total of 204.159 image patches, followed by discrimination analysis using our deep learning models. Model performance was evaluated on validation and test data using confusion matrices. ResultsEvaluation of the test set based on tiles and cases revealed overall highly satisfactory prediction capability of our algorithm for the different histological classes, resulting in a tile accuracy of 89% (38 413/43 059) and case accuracy of 94% (198/211). Importantly, the separation of metastasis versus benign lesions was certainly confident on case level, confirming the classification model performed with high diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the whole curated raw data set is made publically available. ConclusionsDeep learning is a promising approach in surgical liver pathology supporting decision making in personalized medicine.

The input is washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes mainly originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, with no more than 5% PET from non-food consumer applications. The flakes are dried (step 2), melted in an extruder (step 3) and decontaminated during a melt-state polycondensation step ■■■■■ (step 4). In step 5, the material is granulated. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the melt-state polycondensation (step 4) is critical in determining the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters to control the performance of the critical step are the pressure, the temperature, the residence time (depending on the mass and throughput of the melt) and the characteristics of the reactor. It was demonstrated that this recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below the conservatively modelled migration of 0.1 & mu;g/kg food. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process is not of safety concern when used at up to 100% for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs, including drinking water, for long-term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill. The final articles made of this recycled PET are not intended to be used in microwave and conventional ovens and such uses are not covered by this evaluation.				fip@efsa.europa.eu	/L-1666-2018	/0000-0001-7878-0877					5	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA		1831-4732		EFSA J	EFSA J.

First, an integral sliding mode-based descriptor observer (ISM-DO) is constructed to estimate the state and fault. The proposed ISM-DO retains the basic characteristics of descriptor systems, meanwhile, it is not only suitable for dual normalized descriptor systems, but also for non-dual normalized descriptor systems. It is more universal than the existing sliding mode fault tolerant control (SMFTC) methods. In the sequel, a novel restricted equivalent form based algorithm is developed to solve the sliding parameters. The proposed method provides a general algorithm, and it does not impose additional rank constraints. Further, a new adaptive sliding mode fault tolerant controller is constructed to stabilize the fault system, the assumption related to the diffusion matrix is removed. Based on these ingredients, the asymptotically mean square admissibility of the closed-loop fault system and the observer gain matrix are got by a sufficient linear matrix inequality condition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations.

Energetic music is used for anger downregulation: A cross-cultural differentiation of intensity from rhythmic arousal	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							INDIVIDUALISM-COLLECTIVISM; UNITED-STATES; EMOTIONS; AGGRESSION; EXPRESSION; LANGUAGE; GENDER	Music is often used to "soothe the soul," and one important function of music listening has been emotion regulation. In comparing consumption trends across cultures, past research has shown that individuals in Western countries, with typically higher prevalence of high arousal negative emotions, tend to listen to similarly high arousal rhythmic (danceable) music to cathartically discharge those emotions. However, other studies have shown that Spotify's energy feature, a measure of the intensity-based arousal of a song, indicates the opposite effect: Energy was higher in songs in East Asian top-50 charts than in Western ones. Combining evidence from reanalyses of secondary data (Pilot Analyses 1 and 2), sentiment analyses of lyrics from the US and Singapore (Study 1; N = 87 songs), and an emotion induction experiment in Japan and the US (Study 2; N = 353 participants), we show that collectivistic, East Asian cultures generally prefer songs with higher energy levels, and energetic songs are robustly associated with anger downregulation, over sadness and anxiety downregulation. We speculate that energy, as an intensity-based musical arousal feature, may represent internalizing (control) regulation that one uses to "drown out" anger, which would be more prevalent in East Asian cultures due to sociocultural norms of emotion (non)expression. Conversely, this would be different from the externalizing regulation associated with rhythm-based musical arousal (i.e., danceability).

In silico analysis was used to pinpoint the expression of ANXA2, which was verified in clinical peripheral blood samples. SD rats were used for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) establishment. The experimental data suggested that T lymphocytes were increased in peripheral blood samples of ischemic stroke patients and MCAO rats. The MCAO rats were treated with anti-ANXA2 alone or combined with RP101075 (T lymphocyte infiltration inhibitor), followed by brain injury assessment. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) was induced in primary cortical neurons, where shRNAs targeting ANXA2 or METTL3, or overexpression plasmids of METTL3 were introduced to verify the regulatory function for METTL3. Inhibition of T lymphocyte migration to the ischemic brain reduced brain injury in MCAO rats and neuronal damage in OGD/R-exposed neurons. Ablation of ANXA2 in T lymphocytes inhibited the migration of T lymphocytes to the ischemic brain and reduced neuronal damage. Mechanistically, METTL3 reduced ANXA2 expression in T lymphocytes through m6A modification and inhibited p38MAPK/MMP-9 pathway activation, exerting protective effects against neuronal damage in ischemic stroke. Overall, this study reveals the neuroprotective effects of METTL3-mediated ANXA2/p38MAPK/MMP-9 inhibition against ischemic stroke.

These molecules constitute a substantial portion of phospholipids in plasma membranes. Therefore, both DHA and ARA are essential diet components. Once consumed, DHA and ARA can interact with a large variety of biomolecules, including proteins such as insulin and a-synuclein (a-Syn). Under pathological conditions known as injection amyloidosis and Parkinson's disease, these proteins aggregate forming amyloid oligomers and fibrils, toxic species that exert high cell toxicity. In this study, we investigate the role of DHA and ARA in the aggregation properties of a-Syn and insulin. We found that the presence of both DHA and ARA at the equimolar concentrations strongly accelerated aggregation rates of a-Syn and insulin. Furthermore, LCPUFAs substantially altered the secondary structure of protein aggregates, whereas no noticeable changes in the fibril morphology were observed. Nanoscale Infrared analysis of a-Syn and insulin fibrils grown in the presence of both DHA and ARA revealed the presence of LCPUFAs in these aggregates. We also found that such LCPUFAs-rich a-Syn and insulin fibrils exerted significantly greater toxicities compared to the aggregates grown in the LCPUFAs-free environment. These findings show that interactions between amyloid-associated proteins and LCPUFAs can be the underlying molecular cause of neurodegenerative diseases.

J	Mitchell, ZA; Cottenie, K; Schwalb, AN				Mitchell, Zachary A. A.; Cottenie, Karl; Schwalb, Astrid N. N.			Trait-based and multi-scale approach provides insight on responses of freshwater mussels to environmental heterogeneity	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						environmental filtering; life history strategy; metacommunity; riverine organisms; space; Unionidae	NETWORK POSITION HYPOTHESIS; SPATIAL PROCESSES; LIFE-HISTORY; MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; SPECIES RICHNESS; FLATHEAD CATFISH; STREAM NETWORKS; HOST FISHES; RIVER; DIVERSITY	Our understanding of the factors driving the distribution of metacommunities at different scales can be obscured by high variation in species composition between sites and a lack of fine-scale distribution data. Trait-based approaches have long been used to better identify and examine ecological patterns. Most recent studies of riverine metacommunities examining trait-based patterns have focused on shorter lived organisms. Here we focused on a group of longer lived, sedentary riverine organisms, unionid freshwater mussels. The objective of this study was to examine how (1) the distribution of mussels with different life history strategies (trait-based approach) and (2) the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors (as a proxy for dispersal) would differ with spatial scale and position in the river; and to (3) further compare this with patterns derived from a taxonomic approach. Fine-scale distribution data of mussels and environmental factors were collected every 100 m in spatially extensive surveys in an upstream and downstream segment (200 sites/20-km segment) of a semiarid river, making them some of the most spatially intensive surveys documented to date. A combination of redundancy analysis, asymmetric eigenvector mapping, and variation partitioning analyses revealed that more variation was explained by environmental factors where more environmental differences occur between sites. Where environmental heterogeneity was lower, the amount of variation explained by smaller scale spatial factors was higher, likely mostly associated with stochastic rather than dispersal processes. A higher amount of unexplained variation at the taxonomic level suggests that stochasticity may also play an important role in determining species composition. In contrast, different life history groups had a highly predictable distribution pattern driven by environmental heterogeneity, especially between river segments and mesohabitat, which was associated with different flow conditions. The role we predict for environmental heterogeneity and stochasticity in shaping the distribution of mussels in our study river likely also applies to other taxa and ecosystems at a spatial scale at which neither dispersal limitation nor mass effects occur. Thus, understanding the magnitude and extent of dispersal relative to the amount of environmental heterogeneity may be key for predicting metacommunity structure and dynamics for different organisms.

This study aimed to weigh the quality of the Ojarud River in Ardabil, Iran, applying biological and physiological indices of macro-invertebrates. A total of 12,524 samplings were fulfilled at four stations (S1, S2, S3, S4) from the headstream to downstream by a Surber sampler (30 x 30 cm(2)) from June/2020 to April/2021. All year round, the highest frequent families were Chironomidae (2658), Simuliidae (1025) from Diptera and Caenidae (1855), and Baetidae (724) from Ephemeroptera. The diversity pattern was analyzed by PAST software, and Primer 7 (BIO-ENV analysis) was utilized to understand what factor has the most impact on the distribution of macro-invertebrates. The least similarity of S4 to other stations was recognized by Cluster analysis. As per the ANOSIM (analysis of similarities), a statistically significant difference in the macroinvertebrates' frequency was established between S3 and other stations (p = .0001, r = .63). Moreover, the relationship between heavy metals and macro-invertebrate showed that the three families of Simuliidae, Gomphidae, and Caenidae had a positive correlation with the concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment. As per the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera index, the water quality was placed in the "excellent" class, but the Biological Monitoring Working Party and Hilsenhoff Family Biotic Index indices scored the water quality "good" class at S1 and the "poor" class at S3. Based on the results of this study, the use of physicochemical and hydro-morphological indicators can support the biological indicators but cannot replace them. In addition, careful evaluation of biological indicators is required to develop conservation strategies.

Therefore, compromised renal function increases the risk for adverse outcomes for pregnant women and their offspring. Acute kidney injury (AKI), or sudden loss of kidney function, is a significant event that requires aggressive clinical management. An AKI event in pregnancy, or in the postpartum period, significantly increases the risk of adverse pregnancy events and fetal and maternal mortality. At present, there are significant clinical challenges to the identification, diagnosis, and management of pregnancy-associated AKI due to changing hemodynamics in pregnancy that alter baseline values and to treatment limitations in pregnancy. Emerging data indicate that patients that are considered clinically recovered following AKI, which is currently assessed primarily by return of plasma creatinine levels to normal, maintain risk of long-term complications indicating that current recovery criteria mask the detection of subclinical renal damage. In association, recent large-scale clinical cohorts indicate that a history of AKI predisposes women to adverse pregnancy events even years after the patient is considered recovered from AKI. Mechanisms via which women develop AKI in pregnancy, or develop adverse pregnancy events post-AKI, are poorly understood and require significant study to better prevent and treat AKI in women. & COPY; 2023 American Physiological Society.

Knockout of floral and meiosis genes using CRISPR/Cas9 produces male-sterility in Eucalyptus without impacts on vegetative growth	PLANT DIRECT			English	Article						biocontainment; CRISPR; Eucalyptus; flowering; forestry; male-sterility; meiosis; pollen	SISTER-CHROMATID COHESION; MEIOTIC RECOMBINATION; RICE; REVEALS; YEAST; TRANSCRIPTOME; PATERNITY; PATHWAY; PROTEIN; GENOME	Eucalyptus spp. are widely cultivated for the production of pulp, energy, essential oils, and as ornamentals. However, their dispersal from plantings, especially when grown as an exotic, can cause ecological disruptions. To provide new tools for prevention of sexual dispersal by pollen as well as to induce male-sterility for hybrid breeding, we studied the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated knockout of three floral genes in both FT-expressing (early-flowering) and non-FT genotypes. We report male-sterile phenotypes resulting from knockout of the homologs of all three genes, including one involved in meiosis and two regulating early stages of pollen development. The targeted genes were Eucalyptus homologs of REC8 (EREC8), TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION 1 (ETDF1), and HECATE3 (EHEC3-like). The erec8 knockouts yielded abnormal pollen grains and a predominance of inviable pollen, whereas the etdf1 and ehec3-like knockouts produced virtually no pollen. In addition to male-sterility, both erec8 and ehec3-like knockouts may provide complete sterility because the failure of erec8 to undergo meiosis is expected to be independent of sex, and ehec3-like knockouts produce flowers with shortened styles and no visible stigmas. When comparing knockouts to controls in wild-type (non-early-flowering) backgrounds, we did not find visible morphological or statistical differences in vegetative traits, including average single-leaf mass, stem volume, density of oil glands, or chlorophyll in leaves. Loss-of-function mutations in any of these three genes show promise as a means of inducing male- or complete sterility without impacting vegetative development.	[Nagle, Michael F.

The capsular polysaccharide (k-type) is a major virulence factor. Bacteriophages are viruses that specifically infect bacteria and have been used to control drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. In particular, A. baumannii phages can recognize specific capsules, from a diversity of >125 that exist. This high specificity demands the in vivo identification of the most virulent A. baumannii k-types that need to be targeted by phage therapy. Currently, the zebrafish embryo has particularly attained interest for in vivo infection modeling. In this study, an A. baumannii infection was successfully established, through the bath immersion of tail-injured zebrafish embryos, to study the virulence of eight capsule types (K1, K2, K9, K32, K38, K44, K45, and K67). The model revealed itself as capable of discerning the most virulent (K2, K9, K32, and K45), middle (K1, K38, and K67), and the less virulent (K44) strains. Additionally, the infection of the most virulent strains was controlled in vivo resorting to the same technique, with previously identified phages (K2, K9, K32, and K45 phages). Phage treatments were able to increase the average survival from 35.2% to up to 74.1% (K32 strain). All the phages performed equally well. Collectively, the results show the potential of the model to not only evaluate virulence of bacteria such as A. baumannii but also assess novel treatments' effectiveness.

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of AI-guided AF ablation between AF patients aged = 80 years (Group 1) and <80 (Group 2).HypothesisWe hypothesized that AI-guided AF ablation could complete the procedure with comparable efficiency and safety in patients aged =80 years and <80.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed 2087 AF patients undergoing their first AI-guided AF ablation in our hospital. We compared the atrial tachyarrhythmia (AT) recurrence and procedure-related complication rate between Group 1 (n = 193) and Group 2 (n = 1894).ResultsThe mean age was 83.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 81.0, 84.0) years in Group 1 and 67.0 (IQR 60.0, 72.0) in Group 2. AF type was significantly different between the two groups: Of Group 1 patients, 120 (62.2%) had paroxysmal AF, 61 (31.6%) persistent AF, and 12 (6.2%) long-standing persistent AF, while of Group 2 patients, 1016 (53.6%) paroxysmal AF, 582 (30.7%) persistent AF, and 296 (15.6%) long-standing persistent AF (p = .001). Unadjusted AT recurrence-free survival curves showed similar AT recurrence-free survival between the two groups (p = .67 by log-rank test). After the adjustment for AF type, the survival curve was similar between them (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI [0.92-1.65]; p = .15, Group 1 vs. Group 2). The rate of procedure-related complications was similar between the two groups (3.1% vs. 3.0%, respectively, p = .83).ConclusionCatheter ablation guided by AI achieved similar AT recurrence and complication rates between elderly AF patients aged = 80 years and patients <80 years.

The magnitude and direction of heterogeneity effects vary widely, and the processes underlying such variations are not fully understood. In this study, we explored how and under what resource conditions small-scale heterogeneity modulates grassland plant diversity.Location Oderhange Mallnow, Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany.MethodsWe expanded the individual-based plant community model (IBC-grass) to incorporate dynamic below-ground resource maps, simulating spatial heterogeneity of resource availability. Empirical centimeter-scale data of soil C/N ratio were integrated into the model, accounting for both configurational and compositional heterogeneity. We then analyzed the interplay between small-scale heterogeneity and resource availability on the interaction and co-existence of plant species and overall diversity.Results Our results showed significant differences between the low- and high-resource scenarios, with both configurational and compositional heterogeneity having a positive effect on species richness and Simpson's diversity, but only under low-resource conditions. As compositional heterogeneity in the fine-scale C/N ratio increased, we observed a positive shift in Simpson's diversity and species richness, with the highest effects at the highest level of variability tested. We observed little to no effect in nutrient-rich scenarios, and a shift to negative effects at the intermediate resource level. The study demonstrates that site-specific resource levels underpin how fine-scale heterogeneity influences plant diversity and species co-existence, and partly explains the divergent effects recorded in different empirical studies.Conclusions This study provides mechanistic insights into the complex relationship between resource heterogeneity and diversity patterns. It highlights the context-dependent effects of small-scale heterogeneity, which can be positive under low-resource, neutral under high-resource, and negative under intermediate-resource conditions. These findings provide a foundation for future investigations into small-scale heterogeneity-diversity relationships, contributing to a deeper understanding of the processes that promote species co-existence in plant communities.

The magnitude and direction of heterogeneity effects vary widely, and the processes underlying such variations are not fully understood. In this study, we explored how and under what resource conditions small-scale heterogeneity modulates grassland plant diversity.LocationOderhange Mallnow, Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany.MethodsWe expanded the individual-based plant community model (IBC-grass) to incorporate dynamic below-ground resource maps, simulating spatial heterogeneity of resource availability. Empirical centimeter-scale data of soil C/N ratio were integrated into the model, accounting for both configurational and compositional heterogeneity. We then analyzed the interplay between small-scale heterogeneity and resource availability on the interaction and co-existence of plant species and overall diversity.ResultsOur results showed significant differences between the low- and high-resource scenarios, with both configurational and compositional heterogeneity having a positive effect on species richness and Simpson's diversity, but only under low-resource conditions. As compositional heterogeneity in the fine-scale C/N ratio increased, we observed a positive shift in Simpson's diversity and species richness, with the highest effects at the highest level of variability tested. We observed little to no effect in nutrient-rich scenarios, and a shift to negative effects at the intermediate resource level. The study demonstrates that site-specific resource levels underpin how fine-scale heterogeneity influences plant diversity and species co-existence, and partly explains the divergent effects recorded in different empirical studies.ConclusionsThis study provides mechanistic insights into the complex relationship between resource heterogeneity and diversity patterns. It highlights the context-dependent effects of small-scale heterogeneity, which can be positive under low-resource, neutral under high-resource, and negative under intermediate-resource conditions. These findings provide a foundation for future investigations into small-scale heterogeneity-diversity relationships, contributing to a deeper understanding of the processes that promote species co-existence in plant communities.

Most technical systems can be described as such since either component types or component functions within the system vary amongst components. While most reliability related work resorts to the assumption of homogeneous components, we aim to address the often more realistic assumption of heterogeneous components extending the model of Extended Sequential Order Statistics by two inferential methods. Firstly, the derivation of Maximum Likelihood Estimates including a simulation study demonstrating their good performance for large enough sample size. Secondly, we introduce a likelihood ratio test to test whether components can be assumed identical accompanied by a power study. Both methods are powerful tools in reliability contexts. The former increases our understanding of component behaviour, especially upon failure of other components. This knowledge empowers system operators to make better decisions regarding maintenance schedules and failure time prediction. The latter supports operators in their quest of identifying component equivalence. Therefore, both methods can be used to achieve meaningful results in real life applications.

After precomputation, we can relight the scene with new environment maps while changing viewpoint in real-time. However, practical PRT methods are usually limited to low-frequency spherical harmonic lighting. All-frequency techniques using wavelets are promising but have so far had little practical impact. The curse of dimensionality and much higher data requirements have typically limited them to relighting with fixed view or only direct lighting with triple product integrals. In this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid neural-wavelet PRT solution to high-frequency indirect illumination, including glossy reflection, for relighting with changing view. Specifically, we seek to represent the light transport function in the Haar wavelet basis. For global illumination, we learn the wavelet transport using a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) applied to a feature field as a function of spatial location and wavelet index, with reflected direction and material parameters being other MLP inputs. We optimize/learn the feature field (compactly represented by a tensor decomposition) and MLP parameters from multiple images of the scene under different lighting and viewing conditions. We demonstrate real-time (512 x 512 at 24 FPS, 800 x 600 at 13 FPS) precomputed rendering of challenging scenes involving view-dependent reflections and even caustics.

Therefore, this meta-analysis aims to elucidate whether new-onset neurodegenerative diseases are long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE were systematically searched for articles published up to January 10, 2023. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to calculate the pooled effect size, expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of each outcome. Twelve studies involving 33 146 809 individuals (2 688 417 post-COVID-19 cases and 30 458 392 controls) were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled analyses compared with control groups showed a significant association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and increased risk for new-onset Alzheimer's disease (HR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.22-1.85, I-2 = 97%), dementia (HR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.42-1.94, I-2 = 91%), and Parkinson's disease (HR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.06-1.95, I-2 = 86%) among COVID-19 survivors. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with a higher risk for new-onset neurodegenerative diseases in recovered COVID-19 patients. Future studies are warranted to determine the biological mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative consequences of COVID-19 as long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Materials and MethodsThe purpose of this observational study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new device delivering microwaves (MWs) energy for unwanted fat and cellulite reduction after a full cycle of treatments and 1 year later. A total of 45 patients with localized adiposity and/or cellulite in different body areas (inner thigh, upper arm, abdomen, culotte de cheval, buttocks), received four treatment sessions, 4 weeks apart. Photographic records and global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) score were performed. ResultsFor the treatment of cellulite the average GAIS score passed from 3.65 & PLUSMN; 0.49 at 1-month follow-up (1MFU) to 2.7 & PLUSMN; 0.66 at 1-year follow-up (1YFU). For the treatment of localized adiposity, the average GAIS score passed from 3.52 & PLUSMN; 0.51 at 1MFU to 2.82 & PLUSMN; 0.88 at 1YFU. No particular red area was detected either during or after the treatment. There was no mention of assessment of pain or side effects. ConclusionsThe study findings showed that MWs allow for the treatment of cellulite and localized fat adiposity in a safe and effective way, with results lasting over time up to 1 year after the end of the treatment.

J	Shunatova, N; Denisova, S; Shchenkov, S; Filippov, A				Shunatova, Natalia; Denisova, Sofia; Shchenkov, Sergei; Filippov, Artem			Colonial system of integration and communication pores in a polymorphic bryozoan <i>Dendrobeania fruticosa</i> (Bryozoa: Cheilostomata)	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY			English	Article						Autozooid; avicularium; funicular system; funiculus; kenozooid; rosette complexes; ultrastructure	MARINE BRYOZOAN; ELECTRA-PILOSA; AVICULARIA; FUNICULUS	Bryozoan colonies are composed of zooids, which can differ in structure and function. Autozooids supply heteromorphic zooids with nutrients, which are usually unable to feed. To date, the ultrastructure of the tissues providing nutrient transfer is almost unexplored. Here, we present a detailed description of the colonial system of integration (CSI) and the different types of pore plates in Dendrobeania fruticosa. All cells of the CSI are joined by tight junctions that isolate its lumen. The lumen of the CSI is not a single structure, but a dense network of small interstices filled with a heterogeneous matrix. In autozooids, the CSI is composed of two types of cells: elongated and stellate. Elongated cells form the central part of the CSI, including two main longitudinal cords and several main branches to the gut and pore plates. Stellate cells compose the peripheral part of the CSI, which is a delicate mesh starting from the central part and reaching various structures of autozooids. Autozooids have two tiny muscular funiculi, which start from the caecum apex and run to the basal wall. Each funiculus includes a central cord of extracellular matrix and two longitudinal muscle cells; together they are enveloped with a layer of cells. The rosette complexes of all types of pore plates in D. fruticosa display a similar cellular composition: a cincture cell and a few special cells; limiting cells are absent. Special cells have bidirectional polarity in interautozooidal and avicularian pore plates. This is probably due to the need for bidirectional transport of nutrients during degeneration-regeneration cycles. Cincture cells and epidermal cells of pore plates contain microtubules and inclusions resembling dense-cored vesicles, which are typical of neurons. Probably, cincture cells are involved in the signal transduction from one zooid to another and can be a part of the colony-wide nervous system.

The microbiome modulates numerous aspects of host physiology and is critical in the pathophysiology of diseases, including colon cancer. Although gut bacterial pathogenesis has become an emerging area in colon cancer, the multi-kingdom aspect of microbiome has yet to be explored. Similar to the bacterial component of the microbiome, the virome contains certain makeup that varies between individuals. In the current review, we introduce the concepts of microbiome and microbiota, research history, methods for modern microbiome studies, and recent progress of mechanisms responsible for microbiome and virome in colon cancer. Furthermore, we discuss our understanding of microbial metabolites in the disease development and therapy of colon cancer. Finally, the gut microbiota can affect the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapy. We discuss the challenges and future perspectives in microbiome and colon cancer. Exploring and understanding the mechanisms of microbiome will provide insights into effective approaches in potential prevention of treatment of colon cancer. & COPY; 2023 American Physiological Society.

J	Suri, P; Patel, SA; Chhabra, RP				Suri, Preeti; Patel, Swati A.; Chhabra, Rajendra Prasad			Falling ball method for determining zero shear and shear-dependent viscosity of polymeric systems: Solutions, melts, and composites	JOURNAL OF VINYL & ADDITIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						falling ball method; power-law; shear rate; shear stress; zero-shear viscosity	POWER-LAW FLUIDS; APPARENT VISCOSITY; SPHERE; SUSPENSIONS; VISCOMETER; FLOW	The falling ball method (FBM) is one of the well-established techniques for measuring the viscosity of Newtonian liquids at the room as well as at elevated temperatures and pressures. Owing to its simplicity and low cost, the possibility of extending its range of application to non-Newtonian systems including virgin and filled polymer melts, composites, polymer-solutions, and so forth, is explored here, In this work, theoretical results for the flow of power-law fluids past a sphere have been used to extract the values of the zero-shear viscosity and shear-dependent viscosity in the low-shear rate limit. The theoretical scheme outlined here has been validated by presenting comparisons with experimental results for scores of polymer solutions for which both falling sphere and rheological data are available in the literature. Indeed, the good correspondence obtained between these two independent data is encouraging and it is thus possible to use the FBM for shear-thinning systems when the resulting Reynolds numbers are such that the flow is viscosity-dominated, and the inertial effects are negligible. This implies that the Reynolds number should be <= similar to 1 for shear-thinning fluids and <= similar to 10(-5) for shear-thickening fluids.

Microsampling, the process of obtaining small amounts of blood, has thus gained popularity as it offers minimal-invasiveness, reduced logistical costs and biohazard risks while simultaneously showing increased sample stability and a potential for the decentralization of the approach and at-home self-sampling. Although the benefits of microsampling have been recognised, its adoption in clinical practice has been slow. Several microsampling technologies and devices are currently available and employed in research studies for various biomedical applications. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in microsampling technology with a focus on the latest developments and advancements in the field of microsampling. Research published in the year 2022, including studies (i) developing strategies for the quantitation of analytes in microsamples and (ii) bridging and comparing the interchangeability between matrices and choice of technology for a given application, is reviewed to assess the advantages, challenges and limitations of the current state of microsampling. Successful implementation of microsampling in routine clinical care requires continued efforts for standardization and harmonization. Microsampling has been shown to facilitate data-rich studies and a patient-centric approach to healthcare and is foreseen to play a central role in the future digital revolution of healthcare through continuous monitoring to improve the quality of life.

The effects of relatively brief anesthesia exposures used repeatedly to acquire serial magnetic resonance imaging scans could be examined prospectively in rhesus macaques. We analyzed magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 32 rhesus macaques (14 females, 18 males) aged 2 weeks to 36 months to assess postnatal white matter (WM) maturation. We investigated the longitudinal relationships between each DTI property and anesthesia exposure, taking age, sex, and weight of the monkeys into consideration. Quantification of anesthesia exposure was normalized to account for variation in exposures. Segmented linear regression with two knots provided the best model for quantifying WM DTI properties across brain development as well as the summative effect of anesthesia exposure. The resulting model revealed statistically significant age and anesthesia effects in most WM tracts. Our analysis indicated there were major effects on WM associated with low levels of anesthesia even when repeated as few as three times. Fractional anisotropy values were reduced across several WM tracts in the brain, indicating that anesthesia exposure may delay WM maturation, and highlight the potential clinical concerns with even a few exposures in young children.

Head and Neck Necrotizing Fasciitis: Abbreviated SOFA Score Associated With Death and Infection Spread	OTO OPEN			English	Article						descending necrotizing mediastinitis; necrotizing fasciitis; prognostic score	LABORATORY RISK INDICATOR; DESCENDING MEDIASTINITIS; RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS; SINGLE INSTITUTION; MORTALITY; DETERMINANTS; PREDICTORS; DIAGNOSIS; SEPSIS	ObjectiveDescribe features unique to head and neck (H & N) necrotizing fasciitis (NF) compared to other anatomic regions and specify a prognostic score associated with death and descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM). Study DesignRetrospective cohort. SettingTertiary care, level 1 trauma center. MethodsA single-institution database identified 399 confirmed cases of NF between 2006 and 2021, 33 of which involved the H & N. Patients with confirmed H & N NF were sorted into cohorts based on clinical outcomes, with the "poor" outcomes group defined by death and/or DNM. ResultsThirty-three patients with H & N NF were included. Compared to NF of other regions, patients with H & N NF had a significantly lower mortality rate (6.06% vs 20.8%, p = .041) and significantly lower rates of obesity (27.3% vs 63.7%, p < .001) and hypertension (42.4% vs 60.9%, p = .038). Within the H & N group, there were 2 deaths (6.06%) and 8 cases of DNM (24.2%). Diabetes was associated with poor outcomes (p = .047), as was an abbreviated sequential organ failure assessment score for necrotizing fasciitis (nfSOFA) of 2 or greater (p = .015). ConclusionH & N NF is unique among other forms of NF, with a lower mortality rate and lower rates of obesity and hypertension in affected patients. Within the H & N cohort, worse outcomes were associated with diabetes as well as a nfSOFA score of 2 or greater. Timely surgical debridement alongside broad-spectrum antibiotics remains the mainstay of treatment for NF; however, this simple prognostic score may play a role during the early stages of care for patients with H & N NF.

This longitudinal study assessed the effects of plasma cortisol on hippocampal atrophy and clinical progression rates in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MethodsPatients with amnestic MCI (n = 304) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) based on availability of baseline plasma cortisol and hippocampal volume measures, assessed at baseline and during follow-ups. We investigated associations between plasma cortisol, hippocampal volume, and risk of clinical progression to AD over a study period of up to 100 months (mean follow-up time 36.8 months) using linear mixed models, Cox proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier estimators. ResultsPlasma cortisol predicted greater hippocampal atrophy, such that participants with higher cortisol showed faster decline in hippocampal volume over time (interaction: & beta; = -0.15, p = 0.004). Small hippocampal volume predicted a higher risk of clinical progression to AD (haard ratio [HR] = 2.15; confidence in terval [CI], 1.64-2.80; p < 0.001). A similar effect was not found for cortisol (HR = 1.206; CI, 0.82-1.37; p = 0.670) and there was no statistical evidence for an interaction between hippocampal volume and cortisol on clinical progression (HR = 0.81; CI, 0.57-0.17; p = 0.260). DiscussionOur findings suggest that higher cortisol predicts higher hippocampal atrophy, which in turn is a risk factor for progression to AD. Regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through stress-reducing lifestyle interventions might be a protective factor against hippocampal degeneration at the prodromal stage of AD.

The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) was considered a focal animal for investigating the effect of foraging-tunnel disturbances created by herbivorous mammals on the above-ground biomass and species richness of graminoids and forbs. Here, we ask how foraging-tunnel disturbances created by plateau zokors influences above-ground plant biomass and species richness of graminoids and forbs in alpine grasslands.Location: The study was conducted at three sites of alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China.Methods: In this study, all vascular plants were divided into graminoids and forbs, and 30 paired quadrats were randomly selected from each site. In total, 90 tunnel quadrats and 90 non-tunnel quadrats were surveyed and sampled.Results: This study showed that foraging-tunnel disturbances decreased the plant species richness of the grassland community and forbs by 16.5% and 17.7% respectively, whereas the response of graminoid species richness to foraging-tunnel disturbance was different among the three sites, in which foraging-tunnel disturbance decreased the graminoid species richness at Maqu and Xiahe sites and had no impact on the graminoid species richness at Tianzhu site. Regarding forbs, some legumes identified in the non-tunnel quadrats were not observed in the tunnel quadrats. The foraging-tunnel disturbances resulted in an above-ground plant biomass decrease of 21.9% in the grassland community, 27.3% in forbs, and 17.2% in graminoids respectively. The percentage of graminoids in the above-ground plant biomass increased from 50.4% in non-tunnel quadrats to 55.5% in tunnel quadrats, a relative increase of 10.1% from the initial percentage.Conclusions: These results indicate that the foraging-tunnel disturbances seemed to improve the forage availability for livestock in tunnel quadrats due to a higher relative proportion of graminoids in the grassland plant community, despite a decrease in graminoid biomass. However, the tunnels not only decreased the above-ground plant biomass and species richness of forbs, but also might have a negative impact on soil nitrogen input because of the absence of some legumes. The findings of this study suggest that reseeding some legumes is an effective approach to maintaining plant diversity and soil fertility, which can compensate for the negative effect of foraging-tunnel disturbance on alpine grasslands.

The diversity and composition of soil microbial communities are sensitive to grazing disturbances. However, our understanding is limited with respect to the effects of grazing intensity on bacterial and fungal communities, especially in plant rhizosphere. Using a long-term grazing experiment, we evaluated the diversity and composition of microbial communities in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils under three grazing intensities (light, moderate, and heavy grazing) in a desert grassland and examined the relative roles of grazing-induced changes in some abiotic and biotic factors in affecting the diversity and composition of microbial communities. Our results showed that soil bacteria differed greatly in diversity and composition between rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere zones, and so did soil fungi. Moderate and heavy grazing significantly reduced the rhizosphere bacterial diversity. Grazing intensity substantially altered the bacterial composition and the fungal composition in both zones but with different mechanisms. While root nitrogen and soil nitrogen played an important role in shaping the rhizosphere bacterial composition, soil-available phosphorus greatly affected the non-rhizosphere bacterial composition and the fungal composition in both soils. This study provides direct experimental evidence that the diversity and composition of microbial communities were severely altered by heavy grazing on a desert grassland. Thus, to restore the grazing-induced, degraded grasslands, we should pay more attention to the conservation of soil microbes in addition to vegetation recovery.

This experiment was designed to investigate whether miR-223-3p secreted in the serum of KD patients affects the proliferation and apoptosis of HCAECs in KD by regulating FOXP3. MethodsBlood samples were collected in acute febrile phase of KD, after IVIG treatment, and from healthy controls. Transfected into HCAECs cells by synthetic FOXP3 siRNA/NC. A co-culture system was established between HCAECs cells transfected with FOXP3 siRNA/NC and THP1 cells added with three sera. ResultsCompared with the control group, the expressions of miR-223-3p, ROR & gamma;t, and Th17 in serum of KD patients were significantly upregulated, and the expressions of TGF-& beta;1, FOXP3 and Treg were significantly downregulated. At the same time, the levels of IL-6, IL-17, and IL-23 were significantly increased, and the levels of IL-10 and FOXP3 were significantly decreased. After IVIG treatment, the patient's above results were reversed. The serum of KD patients increased the expression of miR-223-3p and inhibited the expression of FOXP3 in HCAECs cells. IVIG serum is the opposite. Overexpression of miR-223-3p also promoted the apoptosis of HCAECs. In addition, serum from KD patients promoted apoptosis, whereas serum after IVIG treatment inhibited apoptosis. KD patient serum downregulated the expression of FOXP3, Bcl2, TGF-& beta;1 and IL-10 in cells, and upregulated the expression of caspase3, Bax, IL-17, IL-6, and IL-23. The opposite results were obtained with IVIG-treated sera. ConclusionmiR-223-3p secreted in serum of KD patients can regulate the expression of FOXP3 and affect the proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation of cells.

A Practical and Hierarchical Yarn-based Shading Model for Cloth	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article								Realistic cloth rendering is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics due to the intricate geometry and hierarchical structure of cloth: Fibers form plies which in turn are combined into yarns which then are woven or knitted into fabrics. Previous fiber-based models have achieved high-quality close-up rendering, but they suffer from high computational cost, which limits their practicality. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model that analytically aggregates light simulation on the fiber level by building on dual-scattering theory. Based on this, we can perform an efficient simulation of ply and yarn shading. Compared to previous methods, our approach is faster and uses less memory while preserving a similar accuracy. We demonstrate both through comparison with existing fiber-based shading models. Our yarn shading model can be applied to curves or surfaces, making it highly versatile for cloth shading. This duality paired with its simplicity and flexibility makes the model particularly useful for film and games production.

MethodsIn this retrospective study, we recruited 510 COPD patients from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009. The patient data were obtained from the electronic medical records of Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Air pollution and meteorological data were obtained from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Monthly COPD hospital admissions, mortality and air pollution data were analysed using Poisson regression in generalised additive models adjusted for mean temperature, pressure and relative humidity. ResultsThere were positive correlations between sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter & LE; 10 & mu;m (PM10) and COPD hospital admissions in the single-pollutant model. An increase of 10 & mu;g/m(3) in SO2 and PM10 were associated with an increase of 4.053% (95% CI: 1.470-5.179%) and 1.401% (95%CI: 0.6656-1.850%) in COPD hospital admissions. In the multiple-pollutant model [SO2 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) combinations], there was only a positive correlation between SO2 and COPD hospital admissions. An increase of 10 & mu;g/m(3) in SO2 were associated with an increase of 1.916% (95% CI: 1.118-4.286%) in COPD hospital admissions. There was no correlation between three pollutant combinations and COPD hospital admissions.We did not find correlations between air pollution and COPD mortality in either single- or multiple-pollutant models. ConclusionsSO(2) and PM10 may be important factors for the increase in COPD hospital admissions in Beijing, China.

We examined how retirement age was associated with later-life dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for people who retired via the disability pathway (received a disability pension prior to old-age pension eligibility) and those who retired via the standard pathway.Methods: The study sample comprised 7210 participants from the Norwegian Trondelag Health Study (HUNT4 70+, 2017-2019) who had worked for at least one year in 1967-2019, worked until age 55+, and retired before HUNT4. Dementia and MCI were clinically assessed in HUNT4 70+ when participants were aged 69-85 years. Historical data on participants' retirement age and pathway were retrieved from population registers. We used multinomial regression to assess the dementia/MCI risk for women and men retiring via the disability pathway, or early (<67 years), on-time (age 67, old-age pension eligibility) or late (age 68+) via the standard pathway.Results: In our study sample, 9.5% had dementia, 35.3% had MCI, and 28.1% retired via the disability pathway. The disability retirement group had an elevated risk of dementia compared to the on-time standard retirement group (relative risk ratio [RRR]: 1.64, 95% CI 1.14-2.37 for women, 1.70, 95% CI 1.17-2.48 for men). MCI risk was lower among men who retired late versus on-time (RRR, 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95).Conclusion: Disability retirees should be monitored more closely, and preventive policies should be considered to minimize the dementia risk observed among this group of retirees.

The dynamic effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on agricultural yield, wages, and food prices in India	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						Agricultural yield; food prices; rainfall shocks; wages	UNIT-ROOT TESTS; PANEL-DATA; SUMMER MONSOON; MODELS; PRODUCTIVITY; VARIABILITY; EMPLOYMENT; WEATHER; INCOME; MARKET	This paper shows that, first, the effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on agricultural yield in India are highly asymmetric: yield falls strongly after droughts, whereas excessive rainfall has only little effects. Second, our key novel finding is that the short-lived yield loss after a widespread drought elicits a persistent decline (increase) in wages (food prices), which lasts for up to five years. Third, affiliation to the same National Sample Survey region (and thus to the same state) seems to be a key determinant of internal migration, whereas distance appears more relevant for food arbitrage trading.

Polymerization of MA_PhOH-Am results in the corresponding poly(ester amide) (P(Es-Am)), through MA thermolysis reaction (generating the corresponding ketene groups) and ketene-phenol addition reaction. Both MA_PhOH-Am and P(Es-Am) have been characterized with spectral methods and thermal analysis. P(Es-Am) has an inherent viscosity of 0.49 dL g(-1), a molecular weight of 76,500 Da, a glass transition temperature of 145 & DEG;C (tan & delta; peak in dynamic mechanical analysis), a thermal stability of about 320 & DEG;C, and a storage modulus at 50 & DEG;C of 1.0 GPa. In the stress-strain measurement, P(Es-Am) exhibits a Young's modulus, a tensile strength, and an elongation at break of 10.6 & PLUSMN; 0.7 GPa, 165 & PLUSMN; 40 MPa, and 1.83 & PLUSMN; 0.41%, respectively. An effective approach for the synthesis of high-performance poly(ester amide)s has been demonstrated.

Patient characteristics and disease course of these conditions and differential diagnosis between AC and achalasia are yet to be elucidated. MethodsA multicenter study involving 10 high-volume hospitals was conducted. Starlet HRM findings were compared between AC and achalasia. Patient characteristics including underlying disorders and disease courses were analyzed in AC and IEM. ResultsFifty-three patients with AC and 92 with IEM were diagnosed, while achalasia was diagnosed in 1784 patients using the Chicago classification v3.0 (CCv3.0). The cut-off integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) value at 15.7 mmHg showed maximum sensitivity (0.80) and specificity (0.87) for differential diagnosis of AC from type I achalasia. While most ACs were based on systemic disorders such as scleroderma (34%) and neuromuscular diseases (8%), 23% were sporadic cases. The symptom severity of AC was not higher than that of IEM. Regarding the diagnosis of IEM, the more stringent CCv4.0 excluded 14.1% of IEM patients than the CCv3.0, although patient characteristics did not change. In patients with the hypomotile esophagus, concomitance of reflux esophagitis was associated with low distal contractile integral and IRP values. AC and IEM transferred between each other, paralleling with the underlying disease course, although no transition to achalasia was observed. ConclusionA successful determination of the optimal cut-off IRP value was achieved using the starlet HRM system to differentiate AC and achalasia. Follow-up HRM is also useful for differentiating AC from achalasia. Symptom severity may depend on underlying diseases instead of hypomotility severity.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oral NAC on oxidative stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: This clinical trial was conducted on 42 MS patients randomly assigned to intervention (n = 21) and control (n = 21) groups. The intervention group received 600 mg of NAC twice daily for 8 weeks, and the control group received a placebo with the same prescription form. An analysis of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), serum nitric oxide (NO), and erythrocyte GSH was carried out on both groups, along with a complete blood count. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess symptoms of depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). Results: Compared to the control group, NAC consumption significantly decreased serum MDA concentrations (-0.33 [-5.85-2.50] vs. 2.75 [-0.25-5.22] mu mol/L; p = 0.03) and HADS-A scores (-1.6 +/- 2.67 vs. 0.33 +/- 2.83; p = 0.02). No significant changes were observed in serum NO concentrations, erythrocyte GSH levels, and HADS-D scores (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Based on the findings of the present study, NAC supplementation for 8 weeks decreased lipid peroxidation and improved anxiety symptoms in MS patients. The aforementioned results suggest that adjunctive therapy with NAC can be considered an effective strategy for MS management. Further randomized controlled studies are warranted.

J	Lee, DT				Lee, Daniel Taehun			Being Zen: Pelevin, Buddha, and the Void	RUSSIAN REVIEW			English	Article								Victor Pelevin, whose rise to popularity coincided with the fall of the Soviet Union, critiques the notion of national identity via the prism of Zen Buddhism. Pelevin embraces the religion's idea of the volatile self and undertakes the project of spiritually empowering the Russians, by exposing the futility of constructing any national identity. With linguistic, cultural, and historical cross-references between Japan and Russia, the author creates a dialogical hybridity that exemplifies the Zen Buddhist concept of non-duality in which the self becomes inseparable from the other. This article analyzes four of Pelevin's novels-Chapaev and Pustota, The Life of Insects, Secret Views of Mount Fuji, and iPhuck 10-and examines how the author incorporates the Zen Buddhist notion of emptiness to reinterpret Russian identity in a spiritually restorative way.

The NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2 and CUC2) transcription factor (TF) family is involved in regulating plant cold tolerance, but the mechanisms underlying these regulatory processes remain unclear. Here, the NAC TF MdNAC104 played a positive role in modulating apple cold tolerance. Under cold stress, MdNAC104-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited less ion leakage and lower ROS (reactive oxygen species) accumulation, but higher contents of osmoregulatory substances and activities of antioxidant enzymes. Transcriptional regulation analysis showed that MdNAC104 directly bound to the MdCBF1 and MdCBF3 promoters to promote expression. In addition, based on combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, as well as promoter binding and transcriptional regulation analyses, we found that MdNAC104 stimulated the accumulation of anthocyanin under cold conditions by upregulating the expression of anthocyanin synthesis-related genes, including MdCHS-b, MdCHI-a, MdF3H-a and MdANS-b, and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes by promoting the expression of the antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes MdFSD2 and MdPRXR1.1. In conclusion, this study revealed the MdNAC104 regulatory mechanism of cold tolerance in apple via CBF-dependent and CBF-independent pathways.

Accurate measurement of its crystalline polymorphs is important since only the beta phase has the desired piezo properties. PVDF was processed into isotropic samples having predominantly alpha, beta, and. crystalline phases. These samples were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR spectra were fitted with the Gaussian peaks for quantitative analysis of the phases. Peaks exclusive to the amorphous phase were identified and used for the amorphous phase quantification, leading to the accurate determination of the crystalline fraction. IR absorption coefficients for their respective peaks were calculated to quantify individual crystalline polymorphs in the sample. Pure phase spectra were extracted, and a linear combination of the pure phase spectra was fitted to the spectrum of a sample with different phases to accurately obtain the values of the phase fraction and the thickness of the sample.

Considering their composition-dependent properties, ohmic current injection and the development of h-BN-based optoelectronic and high-power electronic devices should be achievable by controlling the C concentration. In this study, electrical and optical characterizations of single-crystal h-BN synthesized under high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) are conducted by varying C concentrations via post-growth diffusion. Low C-doped h-BN (h-BN:C) with & AP;0.1 at% C exhibits nonohmic conduction within a voltage range of & PLUSMN;100 V at all temperatures. In contrast, high h-BN:C (& AP;10 at% C) containing C domains and graphite/graphene layers shows additional luminescence peaks and initially exhibits nonohmic conduction at 298 K, which then transforms to ohmic conduction after breakdown-like behavior at 598 K. This phenomenon, observed only in the high h-BN:C devices, is attributed to the C-containing conductive path formed on the channel surface through C drift and local dielectric breakdown of h-BN mother phase, indicating that ohmic conduction itself does not guarantee the current flow in the conduction/valence bands in h-BN:C. With these findings, the present thorough and fruitful characterizations are beneficial for the development of h-BN:C-based devices.

J	Pichel, LM; Legeay, E; Ringenbach, JC; Callot, JP				Pichel, Leonardo M.; Legeay, Etienne; Ringenbach, Jean-Claude; Callot, Jean-Paul			The West African salt-bearing rifted margin-Regional structural variability and salt tectonics between Gabon and Namibe	BASIN RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Gliding; Gravitydriven deformation; Rifted Margins; Salt Basins; Salt tectonics; Spreading	CONTINENTAL BREAK-UP; SOUTH ATLANTIC; PASSIVE-MARGIN; WILSON CYCLE; EVOLUTION; BASIN; KINEMATICS; DEFORMATION; SUBSIDENCE; DEPOSITION	Salt-bearing rifted margins comprise some of the most structurally complex and economically important sedimentary basin settings such as the South Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico salt basins. They are also involved with some of the largest uncertainties regarding the crustal and syn-rift basin architecture and supra-salt tectonic evolution, as well as the link between rifted margin architecture with salt deposition and post-rift gravity-driven salt tectonics. We thus conduct a margin-scale study along nearly the entire West African salt basin, from South Gabon to Namibe, combining a vast data set of 2D and 3D seismic and well data with gravimetric and magnetic data to analyse its along-strike rift and salt tectonic structural variability. We construct regional structural and thickness maps of key salt and post-salt intervals to depict the history of individual margin segments and to investigate (1) how rifting and rifted margin architecture influences post-rift salt tectonics evolution, (2) how these vary through time and space and (3) what are the controls between their different salt tectonic styles. We show that rifting and rift structures controlled the salt basin geometry, thickness and base-salt relief in different ways for the different margin segments, and drastically influenced their post-rift salt tectonic evolution. Differences in post-salt sediment supply and continental uplift also had a role in their salt tectonic evolution. The results also have general implications to understand the interplay between rifted margin architecture with post-rift salt tectonics for salt-bearing rifted margins.

J	Schochow, M; Steger, F				Schochow, Maximilian; Steger, Florian			Women education in the Soviet prophylactoria and the care homes for sexually transmitted disease patients in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany	JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY			English	Article								ObjectivesIn the 1920s, so-called prophylactoria were established in the USSR. In these institutions, sex workers with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were treated. After the end of World War II, care homes for patients with STDs were established in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany (SOZ). These institutions were also intended to treat people suffering from STDs. This article compares these two types of medical institutions. MethodsSources from the State Archive of the Russian Federation in Moscow, the German Federal Archives in Berlin and the City Archive Zwickau were used. The analysed sources were evaluated by using the historical-critical method. ResultsThe prophylactoria were novel institutions that combined education and medical treatment of people with STDs. Similar strategies were followed in the care homes for STD patients. In both institutions, the sick persons had to follow a regular daily routine and work every day. The political indoctrination served to educate 'socialist personalities'. Nevertheless, various differences can be found between the facilities: the length of stay was different. The women in Soviet prophylactoria were cared for there for up to 2 years. However, the standard duration of stay in the care homes for STD patients was 3-6 months. ConclusionsThe prophylactoria had a long-term programme not only to treat sick women but also to reeducate them. The aim was to enlighten and integrate them into the new Soviet society. The care homes for STD patients had a short-term programme of combating venereal diseases. Their main goal was to treat patients with STDs as quickly as possible, while education was an additional measure. Whether both institutions were successful in educating and treating these patients can hardly be assessed from today's perspective.

J.; Mackintosh, Nicola			Understanding the co-construction of safety in the paediatric intensive care unit: A meta-ethnography of parents' experiences	CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access						paediatric intensive care; parent experience; safety	FAMILY-CENTERED CARE; CHILDREN; ICU	BackgroundChildren experiencing critical illness or injury may require admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) to receive life-sustaining or life-saving treatment. Studies have explored the experience of parents with a child in PICU but tend to focus on subgroups of children or specific healthcare systems. Therefore, we aimed to undertake a meta-ethnography to draw together the published research. MethodsA systematic search strategy was developed to identify qualitative studies, which had explored the experiences of parents with a critically ill child treated in a PICU. A meta-ethnography was undertaken following the structured steps of identifying the topic; undertaking a systematic search; reading the research; determining how the studies relate and translate into each other; and synthesising and expressing the results. ResultsWe identified 2989 articles from our search and after a systematic series of exclusions, 15 papers remaining for inclusion. We explored the original parent voices (first order) and the interpretation of the study authors (second order) to identify three third-order concepts (our interpretation of the findings), which related to technical, relational and temporal factors. These factors influenced parents' experiences, providing both barriers and facilitators to how parents and caregivers experienced the time their child was in the PICU. The dynamic and co-constructed nature of safety provided an analytical overarching frame of reference. ConclusionThis synthesis demonstrates novel ways in which parents and caregivers can contribute to the vital role of ensuring a co-created safe healthcare environment for their child when receiving life-saving care within the PICU.

If the binding of the analyte to the surface of the transducer is too far away from the surface, the electric field to the analyte may decay over a distance greater than the debye length thereby reducing the sensitivity of the measurement. In this context, this study has developed a simple one-step protein immobilization strategy to covalently attach proteins on the sensor surface. Our binding strategy, which uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) ensures that the analyte is attached as close as possible to the transducer surface. This study evaluates our findings by comparing our strategy with silane chemistry and elucidating the debye length effects with colorimetric assays and field effect devices. Additionally, as a case study, we also evaluated the performance of our methodology for the detection of glucose oxidation by a field effect device. Overall, the developed immobilization strategy avoids the effects of the debye length and improves the performance of the biosensor.

A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multicenter Efficacy and Safety Study of Methotrexate to Increase Response Rates in Patients With Uncontrolled Gout Receiving Pegloticase: 12-Month Findings	ACR OPEN RHEUMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							LOW-DOSE METHOTREXATE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; TOXICITY; COMORBIDITIES; TOLERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY	ObjectiveTo assess 12-month safety and efficacy of pegloticase + methotrexate (MTX) versus pegloticase + placebo (PBO) cotherapy in a PBO-controlled, double-blind trial (A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, efficacy and safety study of methotrexate to increase response rates in patients with uncontrolled gout receiving pegloticase [MIRROR RCT]). MethodsPatients with uncontrolled gout (serum urate level [SU] & GE;7 mg/dl, oral urate-lowering therapy failure or intolerance, and presence of one or more gout symptoms [one or more tophi, two or more flares in 12 months, gouty arthropathy]) were randomized 2:1 to receive pegloticase (8-mg infusion every 2 weeks) with blinded MTX (oral 15 mg/week) or PBO for 52 weeks. Efficacy end points included proportion of responders (SU level <6 mg/dl for & GE;80% of examined month) in the intent-to-treat population (ITT) (all randomized patients) during month 6 (primary end point), month 9, and month 12; proportion with resolution of one or more tophi (ITT); mean SU reduction (ITT); and time to SU-monitoring pegloticase discontinuation. Safety was evaluated via adverse event reporting and laboratory values. ResultsMonth 12 response rate was significantly higher in patients cotreated with MTX (60.0% [60 of 100] vs. 30.8% [16 of 52]; difference: 29.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 13.2%-44.9%], P = 0.0003), with fewer SU discontinuations (22.9% [22 of 96] vs. 63.3% [31 of 49]). Complete resolution of one or more tophi occurred in 53.8% (28 of 52) versus 31.0% (9 of 29) of MTX versus PBO patients at week 52 (difference: 22.8% [95% CI: 1.2%-44.4%], P = 0.048), more than at week 24 (34.6% [18 of 52] vs. 13.8% [4 of 29]). Consistent with observations through month 6, pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity findings showed increased exposure and lower immunogenicity of pegloticase when administered with MTX, with an otherwise similar safety profile. No infusion reactions occurred after 24 weeks. ConclusionTwelve-month MIRROR RCT data further support MTX cotherapy with pegloticase. Tophi resolution continued to increase through week 52, suggesting continued therapeutic benefit beyond month 6 for a favorable treatment effect.

To date, only preclinical studies and case reports have focused on this potential adverse drug reaction. We aimed to assess the reporting association between DCCIs and hypoxia using the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database (VigiBase). We performed a disproportionality analysis to evaluate the strength of the reporting association between i.v. clevidipine and nicardipine, thought to be a surrogate of patients in the intensive care unit, and hypoxia. The information component and the lower end of its 95% credibility interval were used to evaluate disproportionality. A description of the cases was made. Secondary outcomes included the association between all DCCIs and hypoxia compared with other treatments with similar indications, urapidil and labetalol, regardless of the route of administration. Association between oral nicardipine and hypoxia was also searched. A statistically significant signal of hypoxia was found for intravenous clevidipine and nicardipine. The time to onset was reported with a median of 2 days (interquartile range 1.5-4.5). Four dechallenges were performed with intravenous nicardipine, leading to the resolution of the symptoms. Regardless of the route of administration, a signal of hypoxia was also found for nimodipine but not for other drugs, including comparators. For nicardipine no signal of hypoxia was found with the oral route of administration. Our pharmacovigilance database analysis showed a significant association between the use of intravenous DCCIs and hypoxia.

These studies assessed the associations of seven types of representations with either maladaptive or adaptive coping (20 effect sizes), or with psychosocial outcomes (131 effect sizes). A multivariate meta-analysis revealed that none (0/2) of the associations between the sole type of representation considered (i.e. controllability) and coping strategies were statistically significant, whereas three (3/7) of the associations between representations of infertility and psychosocial outcomes were statistically significant. Regardless of p-values, pooled estimates ranged from low (r = .03) to very high (r = .59).DiscussionFuture studies should validate specific measurement tools for measuring cognitive and emotional representations of infertility.ConclusionOur results highlight the influence of representations of infertility (particularly cognitive representations of consequences and emotional representations) on the psychosocial outcomes of infertility.

AimTo discuss opportunities and challenges of a treat-to-target approach in light of the current 'Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease' (STRIDE-II) consensus. MethodsThe 2021 update of STRIDE-II encompasses 13 evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for treat-to-target strategies in adults and children with IBD. We highlight the potential implications and limitations of these recommendations for clinical practice. ResultsSTRIDE-II provides valuable guidance for personalised IBD management. It reflects scientific progress as well as increased evidence of improved outcomes when more ambitious treatment goals such as mucosal healing are achieved. ConclusionsProspective studies, objective criteria for risk stratification, and better predictors of therapeutic response are needed to potentially render 'treating to target' more effective in the future.

Urinalysis (8OHdG, an oxidative stress marker, and creatinine), blood tests (fatty acids and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25OHD]), exercise intensity, subjective fatigue, muscle elasticity, muscle mass, body fat mass, and nutritional intake using image-based dietary assessment (IBDA) were compared before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention.Results: Consumption of sturgeon fillets suppressed 8OHdG (p < 0.05) in the increased exercise intensity female athletes. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and 25OHD levels in blood increased from before to immediately after and 1 month after the intervention (p < 0.05). IBDA showed that intake of n-3 fatty acid increased after and one month after the intervention, whereas DHA, imidazole dipeptide and vitamin D intake increased after the intervention (p < 0.05) and then decreased after 1 month (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in subjective fatigue, muscle elasticity, muscle mass, and body fat.Conclusions: The results suggest that eating sturgeon fillets during intense training may increase blood levels of EPA, DHA, and 25OHD, which may suppress urinary oxidative stress (8OHdG) in top-ranked Japanese long-distance runners.

Deficits in this measure have been found in persons with schizophrenia and those at clinical high risk (CHR) for this disorder. In CHR patients, we previously found that these deficits predict poorer social functional outcomes after 1 year. In the present study, we tested whether these deficits predicted greater psychosis-spectrum symptom severity and functional impairment over 2 years. We measured N400 semantic priming effects at baseline in CHR patients (n = 47) who viewed prime words each followed by a related/unrelated target word at stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) of 300 or 750 ms. We measured psychosis-spectrum symptoms using the Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms and role and social functioning with the Global Functioning: Role and Social scales, at baseline, 1 (n = 29) and 2 years (n = 25). There was a significant interaction between the N400 semantic priming effect at the 300-ms SOA and time on GF:Role scores, indicating that, contrary to expectations, smaller baseline N400 semantic priming effects were associated with more improvement in role functioning from baseline to Year 1, but baseline N400 priming effects did not predict role functioning at Year 2. N400 priming effects were not significantly associated with different trajectories in psychosis-spectrum symptoms or social functioning. Thus, CHR patients' N400 semantic priming effects did not predict clinical outcomes over 2 years, suggesting that this ERP measure may have greater value as a state or short-term prognostic neurophysiological biomarker.

In this study, the power of unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms is harnessed to analyze chemical reactivity images obtained dynamically by reflectivity microscopy in combination with ex situ scanning electron microscopy to identify and cluster the chemical reactivity of particles in Al alloy. The ML analysis uncovers three distinct clusters of reactivity from unlabeled datasets. A detailed examination of representative reactivity patterns confirms the chemical communication of generated OH- fluxes within particles, as supported by statistical analysis of size distribution and finite element modelling (FEM). The ML procedures also reveal statistically significant patterns of reactivity under dynamic conditions, such as pH acidification. The results align well with a numerical model of chemical communication, underscoring the synergy between data-driven ML and physics-driven FEM approaches.

Mitophagy is a mechanism of mitochondrial quality control that enables selective degradation of damaged and unnecessary mitochondria. Previous studies have found that glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like (GPD1L) is associated with the progression of tumours such as lung cancer, colorectal cancer and oropharyngeal cancer, but the potential mechanism in RCC is still unclear. In this study, microarrays from tumour databases were analysed. The expression of GPD1L was confirmed by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The effect and mechanism of GPD1L were explored using cell counting kit 8, wound healing, invasion, flow cytometry and mitophagy-related experiments. The role of GPD1L was further confirmed in vivo. The results showed that GPD1L expression was downregulated and positively correlated with prognosis in RCC. Functional experiments revealed that GPD1L prevented proliferation, migration and invasion while promoting apoptosis and mitochondrial injury in vitro. The mechanistic results indicated that GPD1L interacted with PINK1, promoting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, inhibition of PINK1 reversed GPD1L-mediated mitochondrial injury and mitophagy. Moreover, GPD1L prevented tumour growth and promoted mitophagy by activating the PINK1/Parkin pathway in vivo. Our study shows that GPD1L has a positive correlation with the prognosis of RCC. The potential mechanism involves interacting with PINK1 and regulating the PINK1/Parkin pathway. In conclusion, these results reveal that GPD1L can act as a biomarker and target for RCC diagnosis and therapy.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of 2.2 million people with type 2 diabetes receiving insulin across 85 health care organizations using a global federated health research network. Three intervention cohorts (SGLT2i, GLP-1RA and SGLT2i + GLP-1RA) were compared against a control cohort (no SGLT2i/GLP-1RA). Propensity score matching for age, ischaemic heart disease, sex, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart failure and glycated haemoglobin was used to balance cohorts 1:1 (SGLT2i, n = 143 600; GLP-1RA, n = 186 841; SGLT-2i + GLP-1RA, n = 108 504). A sub-analysis comparing combination and monotherapy cohorts was also performed. Results: The intervention cohorts showed a reduced hazard ratio (HR, 95% confidence interval) over 5 years compared with the control cohort for all-cause mortality (SGLT2i 0.49, 0.48-0.50; GLP-1RA 0.47, 0.46-0.48; combination 0.25, 0.24-0.26), hospitalization (0.73, 0.72-0.74; 0.69, 0.68-0.69; 0.60, 0.59-0.61) and acute myocardial infarct (0.75, 0.72-0.78; 0.70, 0.68-0.73; 0.63, 0.60-0.66), respectively. All other outcomes showed a significant risk reduction in favour of the intervention cohorts. The sub-analysis showed a significant risk reduction in all-cause mortality for combination therapy versus SGLT2i (0.53, 0.50-0.55) and GLP-1RA (0.56, 0.54-0.59). Conclusions: SGLT2i, GLP-1RAs or combination therapy confers mortality and cardiovascular protection in people with type 2 diabetes over 5 years. Combination therapy was associated with the greatest risk reduction in all-cause mortality versus a propensity matched control cohort. In addition, combination therapy offers a reduction in 5-year all-cause mortality when compared directly against either monotherapy.

Growing evidence has hinted a correlation between BP and neurological diseases. However, existing observational studies contained inconsistent results, and the causality and direction of their relationship remain poorly understood. To assess the causal relationship between BP and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) adopted independent top genetic variants as instruments from the largest accessible genome-wide association studies (GWASs), with BP (n = 218 348), PD (n = 482 730), AD (n = 63 926), stroke (n = 446 696), and MS (n = 115 803). Inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted mode methods, weighted median, and simple mode were performed to explore the causal association. Multiple sensitivity analyses, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) was used to evaluate horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers. With close-to-zero effect estimates, no causal impact of BP on the risk of the four neurological diseases was discovered. However, we found that MS was positively correlated with higher odds of BP (OR = 1.220, 95% CI: 1.058-1.408, p = 0.006), while no causal associations were observed between PD (OR = 0.821, 95% CI: 0.616-1.093, p = 0.176), AD (OR = 1.066, 95% CI: 0.873-1.358, p = 0.603), stroke (OR = 0.911, 95% CI: 0.485-1.713, p = 0.773) and odds of BP. In summary, no causal impact of BP on the risk of PD, AD, MS and stroke was detected in our MR analysis. However, reverse MR analysis identified that only MS was positively correlated with higher odds of BP, but not PD, AD and stroke.

The structural transformations of TiS2 particles with different sizes are investigated at different stages of battery life. Reversible Mg2+ intercalation occurs via three structurally distinct phases of MgxTiS(2), identified by powder X-ray diffraction. Magnesium intercalates initially on octahedral sites and at higher depth of discharge on tetrahedral sites in the interlayers of TiS2, which leads to an expansion initially mainly along the c-axis and later along both the a- and c-axes. A maximum discharge capacity of 172 mAh g(-1) (Ax= 0.36 in MgxTiS2) is observed for smaller TiS2 particles. Parasitic reactions could be reduced by decreasing the cut-off voltage by a constant current constant voltage cycling procedure. The chemical diffusion coefficient of the entire cell is found from galvanostatic intermittent titration technique experiments to be in the order of 10(-15) to 10(-19) cm(2) s(-1).

In this study, DNA methylation patterns are analyzed in 8848 metagenome-assembled high-quality phages from 104 fecal samples using single-molecule real-time sequencing. The results demonstrate that 97.60% of gut phages exhibit methylation, with certain factors correlating with methylation densities. Phages with higher methylation densities appear to have potential viability advantages. Strikingly, more than one-third of the phages possess their own DNA methyltransferases (MTases). Increased MTase copies are associated with higher genome methylation densities, specific methylation motifs, and elevated prevalence of certain phage groups. Notably, the majority of these MTases share close homology with those encoded by gut bacteria, suggesting their exchange during phage-bacterium interactions. Furthermore, these MTases can be employed to accurately predict phage-host relationships. Overall, the findings indicate the widespread utilization of DNA methylation by gut DNA phages as an evasion mechanism against host defense systems, with a substantial contribution from phage-encoded MTases.

Consequently, meat rabbit breeds have become popular in almost all provinces in Vietnam, resulting in a decline in the population of Local Black rabbits over the years. To support breeding programs, there is a crucial need to develop a cryopreservation method. The objective of this study was to develop sperm cryopreservation protocols and determine the optimal cryoprotectant for Local Black rabbit spermatozoa. Rabbit spermatozoa were obtained and diluted with TCG-EggYolk freezing medium containing 5%, 8%, and 10% glycerol or DMSO in a 1:1 ratio. Glycerol and DMSO-free mediums served as the controls. Samples were put into 0.5-mL straws, cooled to 15 degrees C and 5 degrees C, then placed on nitrogen vapour for 15 min and directly immersed in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C. Samples were thawed at 37 degrees C for 60s after being frozen for 72 h Sperm quality measures, such as viability, motility, and membrane integrity, were assessed both before and after freezing. The results showed that the average viability, average motility, and average membrane integrity were 61.9%, 53.9%, and 42.9%, respectively, after thawing with 5% glycerol, which was higher than the two higher concentrations of glycerol (8% and 10%) (p < .05). Similarly, with 8% DMSO, the average viability, average motility, and membrane integrity were 59.2%, 51.0%, and 41.8%, respectively, which were higher than the two concentrations of DMSO (5% and 10%) (p < 0.05). Therefore, the cryopreservation of local black rabbit sperm with 5% glycerol or DMSO 8% resulted in high sperm quality, but considering the practical aspect of minimizing the volume of the preservative, a concentration of 5% glycerol may be the best option.

The initiative gained momentum through colossal investments in Eurasia and Africa, mainly through infrastructure projects, backed by generous funding from Chinese financial institutions. A few years later, Latin America emerged as a new target for geographically extending the BRI. The region provides sufficient motivation to entice Chinese investors; it is well endowed with natural resources, offers a market of approximately 670 million people, and has many unmet needs. In addition, recent geopolitical reasons such as the ongoing trade war between the United States and China may give Chinese enterprises indirect access to the world's largest consumer market. We present a brief overview of the relationship between China and Latin America, focusing on the mode of entry of Asian companies into these territories. We analyze the primary entry mode of Chinese enterprises and whether they do so through Greenfield Investment (GI) or Mergers and Acquisitions (M & A). For this purpose, we use data from the China Global Investment Tracker. Thus, we intend to provide a complete picture of how public and private Chinese organizations are gaining a foothold in Latin America, and present its managerial implications.

Rational Design and Expedient Synthesis of Heparan Sulfate Mimetics from Natural Aminoglycosides for Structure and Activity Relationship Studies	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article; Early Access						Aminoglycosides; Heparan Sulfate; Heparanase; Platelet Factor 4; Tobramycin	INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA; INHIBITOR	Heparan sulfate (HS) contains variably repeating disaccharide units organized into high- and low-sulfated domains. This rich structural diversity enables HS to interact with many proteins and regulate key signaling pathways. Efforts to understand structure-function relationships and harness the therapeutic potential of HS are hindered by the inability to synthesize an extensive library of well-defined HS structures. We herein report a rational and expedient approach to access a library of 27 oligosaccharides from natural aminoglycosides as HS mimetics in 7-12 steps. This strategy significantly reduces the number of steps as compared to the traditional synthesis of HS oligosaccharides from monosaccharide building blocks. Combined with computational insight, we identify a new class of four trisaccharide compounds derived from the aminoglycoside tobramycin that mimic natural HS and have a strong binding to heparanase but a low affinity for off-target platelet factor-4 protein.

However, the function of SlDQD/SDH family genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit metabolites is still unknown. In the present study, we identified a ripening-associated SlDQD/SDH member, SlDQD/SDH2, that plays a key role in shikimate and flavonoid metabolism. Overexpression of this gene resulted in an increased content of shikimate and flavonoids, while knockout of this gene by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing led to a significantly lower content of shikimate and flavonoids by downregulation of flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes. Moreover, we showed that SlDQD/SDH2 confers resistance against Botrytis cinerea attack in post-harvest tomato fruit. Dual-luciferase reporter and EMSA assays indicated that SlDQD/SDH2 is a direct target of the key ripening regulator SlTAGL1. In general, this study provided a new insight into the biosynthesis of flavonoid and B. cinerea resistance in fruit tomatoes.

To slow virus spread, practices were enacted to minimize face-to-face contact, leading to increased social disconnection. As people turned increasingly to online environments (e.g., social media) to fulfill needs for inclusion and belonging, misinformation regarding COVID-19 simultaneously ran rampant. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether impeded social inclusion may have contributed to the spread of misinformation. We recruited a sample of adult social media users in the United States (N = 431) and randomly assigned them to be either included, ostracized (i.e., ignored), or rejected (i.e., to receive explicitly negative attention). Participants subsequently rated their willingness to share COVID-19 claims via social media (in fact, all claims were false). Participants learned that sharing some claims would likely lead to high expected engagement from others on social media (e.g., "likes"), whereas some claims would likely lead to little expected engagement. While information sharing was low in our sample, participants were more willing to share claims that they believed would lead to higher levels of engagement-consistent with the idea that sharing information is motivated not only by the desire to educate others but also to elicit social connection. However, this behavioral intention was no more common among participants who had been momentarily ostracized or rejected online than among participants who had been included. Future research should continue to explore the link between social exclusion and the motivation to disseminate (mis)information beyond a pandemic-related context.

It is challenging to discriminate adenomas from nonneoplastic colorectal polyps macroscopically. This study aimed to explore the endoscopic features of different histopathological patterns of colorectal polyps in CCS.Methods: Sixty-seven lesions from 23 CCS patients were prospectively biopsied or resected during the colonoscopic examination for histopathological analysis. The Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistical analysis were conducted to reveal the predictive endoscopic features of CCS polyps with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) and adenomas.Results: There were seven (10.4%) adenomas, 20 (29.9%) CCS-LGD, and 40 (59.7%) nonneoplastic CCS polyps. Polyps were large (>20 mm) in none of the adenomas, 30.0% of CCS-LGD polyps, and 2.5% of nonneoplastic CCS polyps (P < 0.001). The color of the polyps was whitish for 71.4% of adenomas, 10.0% of CCS-LGD polyps, and 15.0% of nonneoplastic CCS polyps (P = 0.004). Pedunculated polyps were detected in 42.9% of adenomas, 45.0% of CCS-LGD polyps, and 5.0% of nonneoplastic CCS polyps (P < 0.001). The proportions of types IV and V-I in the Kudo classification were 42.9%, 95.0%, and 35.0% in adenomatous, CCS-LGD, and nonneoplastic CCS polyps, respectively (P = 0.002). The endoscopic activity was in remission for 71.4% of adenomas, 5.0% of CCS-LGD polyps, and 10.0% of nonneoplastic CCS polyps (P < 0.001).Conclusion: Endoscopic features, including the size, color, sessility, Kudo's pit pattern classification of polyps, and endoscopic activity, help identify the histopathological patterns of colorectal polyps in CCS.

However, the design of high-performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near-infrared (NIR) absorption (& lambda;(abs)>800 nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low-frequency vibrations and enhancing the push-pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1-NEt2) based on the boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA-approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; & lambda;(abs)=788 nm), BDP1-NEt2 exhibited a UV/Vis-NIR spectrum peaked at 825 nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.

Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and shows a significant correlation with the B7 family in tumorigenesis and progression. Helicobacter pylori infection is the most important risk factor promoting the progression of gastric precancerous lesions and GC, which also affects the expression of B7 family members. We aimed to systematically summarize and review current studies on the expression and function of B7 family members during H. pylori infection in precancerous gastric lesions and GC. Materials and MethodsPubMed was searched for the relationship between B7 family, H. pylori and gastric carcinogenesis until April 5, 2023. Different permutation and combination of the search terms, including "H. pylori," "Helicobacter pylori," "B7," "gastric cancer," and "gastric precancerous lesions," all the different names of specific B7 molecules, and the names of signaling pathways were used. Literature related to our research topic was selected and summarized. ResultsThe B7 family participates in gastric carcinogenesis through certain immune signaling pathways by binding to their receptors and exhibiting co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory effects. Targeting the B7 family members with mAbs may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating gastric diseases. ConclusionsA thorough understanding of the role of B7 molecules during H. pylori infection and GC progression is helpful for the treatment and prevention of GC and the prediction of H. pylori infection outcomes, providing evidence for H. pylori eradication.

The data on its epidemiology, especially in socioeconomically deprived nomadic communities, are scarce in Pakistan. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of anti-T. canis antibodies and its associated risk factors in nomadic communities located in and around Multan, Pakistan. A total of 184 sera samples were collected from nomadic communities by simple random sampling technique. The descriptive epidemiological data of participants were collected on well-designed questionnaires. Prior consent was also obtained from the participants to use the data generated from their samples without showing their identity. All the samples were analysed for the detection of anti-T. canis antibodies using commercially available Enzyme-Linked-Immunosorbent-Assay (ELISA) kits having 91% sensitivity and 96% specificity (Bordier Affinity Products, Switzerland). The overall seroprevalence of toxocariasis among nomadic communities was 27.7% (51/184). Various factors, including age, known disease history, nutritional status, contact with dogs, practice of hand washing after contact with dogs, use of unwashed vegetables, body mass index, and drug abuse, showed significant correlation (p < 0.05) with toxocariasis in nomadic communities. Conversely, other factors, including gender, marital status, educational status, awareness about zoonotic diseases, source of drinking water, occupation, location, hand washing before taking food, exposure to soil, and hygienic eating behaviour, showed non-significant correlation (p > 0.05) with seroprevalence of toxocariasis. Results also showed that >50% of seropositive cases were asymptomatic, whereas cough and abdominal pain were recorded in 19.6% and 11.76% of seropositive cases, respectively. Keeping in view, it is suggested to conduct surveys at mass level to rule out the exact disease status at national level and to include nomadic communities in local, national, and regional disease control programs through provision of better healthcare facilities and awareness about the disease.

Favorable outcomes in Hispanic recipients receiving simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation	CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION			English	Article; Early Access						graft survival; Hispanic; race; simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation; whites	RACIAL-DIFFERENCES; DIABETES-MELLITUS; HEALTH; DISPARITIES; ACCESS; NEPHROPATHY; MORTALITY; ALLOGRAFT	The objective of this study was to compare the long-term outcomes of Hispanic versus white recipients who underwent simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPKT). This single-center study, conducted from 2003 to 2022, had a median follow-up of 7.5 years. The study included 91 Hispanic and 202 white SPKT recipients. The mean age (44 vs. 46 years), percentage of males (67% vs. 58%), and body mass index (BMI) (25.6 vs. 25.3 kg/m(2)) were similar between the Hispanic and white groups. The Hispanic group had more recipients with type 2 diabetes (38%) compared to the white group (5%, p < .001). The duration of dialysis was longer in Hispanics (640 vs. 473 days, p = .02), and fewer patients received preemptive transplants (10% vs. 29%, p < .01) compared to whites. Hospital length of stay, rates of BK Viremia, and acute rejection episodes within 1 year were similar between the groups. The estimated 5-year kidney, pancreas, and patient survival rates were also similar between the groups, 94%, 81%, and 95% in Hispanics, compared to 90%, 79%, and 90% in whites. Increasing age and longer duration of dialysis were risk factors for death. Although Hispanic recipients had a longer duration on dialysis and fewer preemptive transplants, the survival rates were similar to those of white recipients. However, referring providers and many transplant centers continue to overlook pancreas transplants for appropriately selected patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly among minority populations. As a transplant community, it is crucial that we make efforts to comprehend and tackle these obstacles to transplantation.

DS is characterized by multi-systemic premature aging associated with deficit in motor coordination, balance, and postural control. Using a morphological, morphometrical, and immunocytochemical ultrastructural approach, this study investigated in vastus lateralis muscle of Ts65Dn mouse, a murine model of DS, the effect of an adapted physical training on the extracellular matrix (ECM) characteristics and whether the forecasted exercise-induced ECM remodeling impacts on sarcomere organization. Morphometry demonstrated thicker basement membrane and larger collagen bundles with larger interfibrillar spacing as well as irregularly arrayed myofibrils and lower telethonin density on Z-lines in trisomic versus euploid sedentary mice. In agreement with the multi-systemic premature aging described in DS, these ECM alterations were similar to those previously observed in skeletal muscle of aged mice. Adapted physical training induced remodeling of ECM in both trisomic and euploid mice, that is, enlargement of the collagen bundles associated with hypertrophy of collagen fibrils and reduction of the interfibrillar spacing. A re-alignment of the myofibrils and a higher telethonin density on Z-line was found in trisomic mice. Altogether, our findings suggest that physical training is an effective tool in limiting/counteracting the trisomy-associated musculoskeletal structural anomalies. The current findings constitute a solid experimental background for further study investigating the possible positive effect of physical training on skeletal muscle performance.

We prove a central limit theorem for T(H,Gn)$$ T\left(H,{G}_n\right) $$ (we denote the appropriately centered and rescaled statistic as Z(H,Gn)$$ Z\left(H,{G}_n\right) $$) with explicit error rates. The error rates arise from graph counts of collections formed by joining copies of H$$ H $$ which we call good joins. Good joins are closely related to the fourth moment of Z(H,Gn)$$ Z\left(H,{G}_n\right) $$, which allows us to show a fourth moment phenomenon for the central limit theorem. For c & GE;30$$ c\ge 30 $$, we show that Z(H,Gn)$$ Z\left(H,{G}_n\right) $$ converges in distribution to MATHEMATICAL SCRIPT CAPITAL N �(0,1) whenever its fourth moment converges to 3. We show the convergence of the fourth moment is necessary to obtain a normal limit when c & GE;2$$ c\ge 2 $$.

Regarding practical application and future commercialization, the air-water stability and photocatalytic performance of OIHPs need to be further improved. Accordingly, studying modification strategies and interfacial interaction mechanisms is crucial. In this review, the current progress in the development and photocatalytic fundamentals of OIHPs is summarized. Furthermore, the structural modification strategies of OIHPs, including dimensionality control, heterojunction design, encapsulation techniques, and so on for the enhancement of charge-carrier transfer and the enlargement of long-term stability, are elucidated. Subsequently, the interfacial mechanisms and charge-carrier dynamics of OIHPs during the photocatalytic process are systematically specified and classified via diverse photophysical and electrochemical characterization methods, such as time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, transient photocurrent densities, and so forth. Eventually, various photocatalytic applications of OIHPs, including hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, and photocatalytic conversion of organic matter.

Spatial ARFIMA models represent a widely used class of spatial models for analyzing such data. Here, we consider their generalization to conditional autoregressive fractional integrated moving average (CARFIMA) models, a larger class of long memory models which allows a wider range of correlation behavior. For this class we provide detailed descriptions of important representative models, make the necessary comparison with some other existing models, and discuss some important inferential and computational issues on estimation, simulation and long memory process approximation. Results from model fit comparison and predictive performance of CARFIMA models are also discussed through a statistical analysis of satellite land surface temperature data.

Observation of this vital intermediate was made possible in this extremely reactive environment by the use of a microreactor coupled with synchrotron radiation and photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, despite its short lifetime and low concentration. Together with ab-initio master equation-calculated rates and fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations, our measurements show that even under the low pressures and short residence times in our experiment, ethyl formation can only be explained by bimolecular reactions; the most important is the catalytic attack of ethane by H atoms, which are then regenerated by decomposition of the nascent ethyl radicals. Our results complete the observation of all hypothesized intermediates in this industrially important process and highlight the need for further studies under additional conditions using similar methods to improve existing models and optimize process chemistries.

J	Hajduk, A; Ulrich, N				Hajduk, Anna; Ulrich, Nadin			Determination of acidity constants of pyridines, imidazoles, and oximes by capillary electrophoresis	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Article; Early Access						acidity constant; imidazole; oxime; pyridine	HIGH-THROUGHPUT METHOD; ZONE-ELECTROPHORESIS; MOBILITIES; VALUES	The acidity constant in the form of pK(a) is one of the most important physicochemical quantities. There are prediction tools available for calculating the pK(a), but they only deliver precise calculated values for a relatively small set of chemicals. For complex structures with multiple functional groups in particular, the error in the predicted pK(a) is high due to the application domain of the corresponding models. Thus, we aim to enlarge the dataset of experimentally determined pK(a) values using capillary electrophoresis. We, therefore, selected various pyridines, imidazoles, and oximes to determine the pK(a) values using the internal standard approach and the classical method. Especially oximes were not investigated in the past, and predictions for them include larger errors. Thus, our experimentally determined values could contribute to an improved understanding of various functional groups impacting the pK(a) values and serve as additional datasets to develop improved pK(a) prediction tools.

However, it remains a huge challenge to integrate high elasticity, low hysteresis, and excellent stretch-ability in physical crosslinking hydrogels. This study reports the synthesis of polyacrylamide (PAM)-3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate-grafted super arborized silica nanoparticle (TSASN)-lithium chloride (LiCl) hydrogel sensors with high elasticity, low hysteresis, and excellent electrical conductivity. The introduction of TSASN enhances the mechanical strength and reversible resilience of the PAM-TSASN-LiCl hydrogels by chain entanglement and interfacial chemical bonding, and provides stress-transfer centers for external-force diffusion. These hydrogels show outstanding mechanical strength (a tensile stress of 80-120 kPa, elongation at break of 900-1400%, and dissipated energy of 0.8-9.6 kJ m(-3)), and can withstand multiple mechanical cycles. LiCl addition enables the PAM-TSASN-LiCl hydrogels to exhibit excellent electrical properties with an outstanding sensing performance (gauge factor = 4.5), with rapid response (210 ms) within a wide strain-sensing range (1-800%).

J	He, JF; Mi, CH; Liu, XT; Zhao, YQ				He, Jingfei; Mi, Chenghu; Liu, Xiaotong; Zhao, Yuanqing			Accelerated dynamic MR imaging with joint balanced low-rank tensor and sparsity constraints	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						dynamic magnetic resonance imaging; sparsity; tensor train rank; well-balanced matricization scheme	MATRIX FACTORIZATION; TRAIN RANK; RECONSTRUCTION; COMPLETION; DECOMPOSITION; SEPARATION	BackgroundDynamic magnetic resonance imaging (DMRI) is an essential medical imaging technique, but the slow data acquisition process limits its further development. PurposeBy exploiting the inherent spatio-temporal correlation of MR images, low-rank tensor based methods have been developed to accelerate imaging. However, the tensor rank used by these methods is defined by an unbalanced matricization scheme, which cannot capture the global correlation of DMR data efficiently during the reconstruction process. MethodsIn this paper, an effective reconstruction model is proposed to achieve accurate reconstruction by using the tensor train (TT) rank defined by a well-balanced matricization scheme to exploit the hidden correlation of DMR data and combining sparsity. Meanwhile, the ket augmentation (KA) technology is introduced to preprocess the DMR data into a higher-order tensor through block structure addressing, which further improves the ability of TT rank to explore the local information of the image. In order to solve the proposed model, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the optimization problem into several unconstrained subproblems. ResultsThe performance of the proposed method was validated on the 3D DMR image dataset by using different sampling trajectories and sampling rates. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the reconstruction quality of the proposed method is superior to several state-of-the-art reconstruction methods. ConclusionsThe proposed method successfully utilizes the TT rank to explore the global correlation of DMR images, enabling more detailed information of the image to be captured. Besides, with the sparse priors, the proposed method can further improve the overall reconstruction quality for highly undersampled MR images.

Our aims were to study how prescribed enteral feeding is implemented in VLBW infants and to identify factors associating with slow enteral feeding progression.MethodsOur retrospective cohort included 516 VLBW infants born before 32 weeks of gestation during 2005-2013 and admitted to Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, for at least the two first weeks of life. Nutritional data were collected from birth until the age of 14-28 days, depending on the length of stay.ResultsWe found that enteral feeding progressed slower than recommended and implementation differed from the prescriptions, especially during the parenteral nutrition phase (milk intake 10-20 mL/kg/day): 71% [40-100], median [IQR], of the prescribed enteral milk was administered. The full prescribed amount was less likely administered if a higher volume of gastric residual was aspirated or if the infant did not pass stool during the same day. Longer opiate use, patent ductus arteriosus, respiratory distress syndrome and slower passage of the first meconium associated with slower enteral feeding progression.ConclusionEnteral feeding of a VLBW infant is often not administered as prescribed, which possibly plays a significant role in the slow progression of enteral feeding.

The model was further combined with a model of desorption of antipsychotic compounds to predict kinetics at the sediment-water interface. Antipsychotic compounds were mostly detected in adult crayfish and internal concentrations were similar among targeted compounds, except for lesser concentrations of duloxetine. The model, based on the mass balance of organic chemicals, to predict uptake by organisms exhibited good agreement with measured values (R-2 = 0.53-0.88), except for venlafaxine (R-2 = 0.35). At the sediment-water interface, positive fluxes were observed for antipsychotic compounds and the results from DGT-induced fluxes in sediments (DIFS) coupled with equilibrium hydroxyl-& beta;-cyclodextrin extraction further indicated partial resupply of antipsychotic compounds from sediments to the aqueous phase, despite the labile pool being relatively limited. The results of the present study affirm that DGT techniques can be used as a predictive tool for contamination in benthic invertebrates and can simulate the ability of contaminant resupply from sediments.

CHILD & FAMILY SOCIAL WORK			English	Article; Early Access							SERIOUS MENTAL-ILLNESS; EARLY-CHILDHOOD; CHINA; SCALE; CARE; GRANDMOTHERS; PERFORMANCE; DEPRESSION; PROVISION; DISTRESS	The prevalence and intensity of grandparenting have continued to increase in the era of rapid aging. However, little is known about grandparents with different health statuses as primary caregivers and their implications for children's health. A nationally representative cohort of over 8990 Chinese children interviewed from 2010 to 2018 was used. Random effects logit models were constructed to assess the association of the primary caregiver type (grandparents vs. parents) and caregiver health with child health. Subsequently, additive interactions between the primary caregiver type and caregiver health were estimated to determine whether children cared for by grandparents with poor health were the most vulnerable children in terms of health. Deterioration of health status was found among children cared for mainly by grandparents, manifested as a higher likelihood of illness, depressive symptoms and unmet health care needs. However, children looked after by healthy grandparents tended to exhibit better health than their counterparts who were cared for by unhealthy parents. Grandparents as primary caregivers might not have a universally detrimental effect on child health. Thus, interventions to prompt child health could consider grandparents as caregivers, especially healthy grandparents.

However, in the use of mesenchymal stem cells, some drawbacks including rarely possible tumorigenicity and low engraftment rates have limited their widespread clinical use. Adipose tissue stem cell-derived exosomes (ASCEs) are emerging as effective cell-free therapeutic agents. AimsIt was evaluated the clinical efficacy of combining the application of human ASCE-containing solution (HACS) with microneedling to treat facial skin aging. MethodsA 12-week, prospective, randomized, split-face, comparative study was conducted. Twenty-eight individuals underwent three treatment sessions separated by 3-week intervals and were followed up for 6 weeks after the last session. At each treatment session, HACS and microneedling were administered to one side of the face, and normal saline solution and microneedling were administered to the other side as a control. ResultsThe Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale score was significantly higher on the HACS-treated side than on the control side at the final follow-up visit (p = 0.005). Objective measurements obtained by different devices including PRIMOS Premium, Cutometer MPA 580, Corneometer CM 825, and Mark-Vu confirmed greater clinical improvements in skin wrinkles, elasticity, hydration, and pigmentation on the HACS-treated side than on the control side. The results of the histopathological evaluation were consistent with the clinical findings. No serious adverse events were observed. ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that combined treatment using HACS and microneedling is effective and safe for treating facial skin aging.

In this study, we have designed a fluorophore with a pyridinium scaffold for selective staining of the mitochondria and to detect hypochlorite. The fluorophore exhibits strong solvatochromic emission due to intramolecular charge transfer and excellent sub-cellular localization in the mitochondria. Additionally, it shows a rapid response to HOCl with high selectivity among different reactive oxygen/nitrogen compounds with a detection limit of 2.31 & mu;M. Moreover, it is also utilized for the exogenous and endogenous detection of HOCl in live cells, which may help study the role of hypochlorite in organelles at the cellular level. DFT and TDDFT calculations have been carried out to understand the relationship between the structure and properties of the cationic probes with respect to the & alpha;-cyano substitution and extension of & pi;-conjugation. The selective detection of HOCl by C4 over other cationic probes has also been well-demonstrated, showing how the binding of HOCl affects the electronic properties of C4 through the analysis of non-bonding orbitals (NBO) population, electrostatic potential surface (ESP), and density of states (DOS) projected DOS investigations.

Disparities in prevalence and outcomes of respiratory disease in low- and middle-income countries	PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						children; developing countries; healthcare disparities; respiratory tract diseases	AIR-POLLUTION; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; GLOBAL BURDEN; PEDIATRIC ASTHMA; SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; DIESEL EXHAUST; CHILDREN; HEALTH; PREDICTORS; STRESS	ObjectivesTo provide a comprehensive overview of disparities in prevalence and outcomes of respiratory diseases and notable challenges for providing optimal treatment to pediatric patients with respiratory diseases living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as an input to help better understand the roots of respiratory health disparities. MethodsWe conducted a narrative review of relevant literature published in electronic databases from inception to February 2023 that present data on disparities in prevalence and outcomes of respiratory disease in LMICs. Additionally, we included studies that describe and discuss challenges for providing optimal treatment to pediatric patients with respiratory diseases living in LMICs. ResultsA number of early life exposures have been associated with adverse respiratory outcomes in later life. Several studies have shown marked geographical variations in the prevalence and burden of pediatric asthma, with consistently lower prevalence rates but significantly higher burdens and worse outcomes in LMICs. There is a wide range of challenges that adversely affect the efficient care of children with respiratory diseases that can be classified into three categories: patient-related factors, social/environmental factors, and factors related to healthcare providers or the healthcare system. ConclusionsRespiratory health disparities in children living in LMICs represent a global public health issue mainly explained by an unequal distribution of preventable and modifiable risk factors for respiratory diseases across different demographic groups.

This study reports the case of a 75-year-old Japanese woman who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab therapy for the postoperative recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer. She was admitted to our hospital with fever, hypotension, hepatic disorder, and thrombocytopenia. We observed slight skin rashes on her neck on admission, which spread rapidly across her body within a few days. We diagnosed CRS complicated by severe rashes. CRS symptoms were resolved with corticosteroid therapy, and did not recur thereafter. CRS is a rare, but important, immune-related adverse event associated with ICI therapy.

However, the role of circ-BNC2 (circRNA ID hsa_circ_0086414) in OSCC progression is still unclear. MethodsPlasmid transfection was used to induce overexpression of circ-BNC2. RNA expression of circ-BNC2, microRNA-142-3p (miR-142-3p) and GNAS complex locus (GNAS) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression was assessed by western blot assay or immunohistochemistry assay. Cell proliferation was investigated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry analysis. Cell migratory and invasive abilities and cell apoptosis were assessed by transwell assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Oxidative stress was evaluated by superoxide dismutase activity detection assay, lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde assay and cellular reactive oxygen species assay. The binding relationship between miR-142-3p and circ-BNC2 or GNAS was proved by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. The impacts of circ-BNC2 overexpression on tumor growth in vivo were unveiled by a xenograft mouse model assay. ResultsCirc-BNC2 expression was downregulated in OSCC tissues and cells when compared with adjacent healthy tissues and normal human oral keratinocytes. Circ-BNC2 overexpression repressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of OSCC cells but induced cell apoptosis and oxidative stress. Additionally, circ-BNC2 overexpression inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, circ-BNC2 bound to miR-142-3p, and miR-142-3p targeted GNAS. MiR-142-3p mimic attenuated circ-BNC2 overexpression-mediated effects on the proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and oxidative stress of OSCC cells. The regulation of miR-142-3p in OSCC cell tumor properties involved GNAS. Further, circ-BNC2 introduction promoted GNAS expression by inhibiting miR-142-3p. ConclusionCirc-BNC2 suppressed OSCC malignant progression by upregulating GNAS expression in a miR-142-3p-dependent manner, which suggested that circ-BNC2 might be a novel target for OSCC therapy.

JOURNAL OF COSMETIC DERMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Blindness; filler injection; hyaluronic acid filler; ophthalmic artery; supratrochlear artery	ARTERY	IntroductionInadvertent entry of filler products into the supratrochlear, supraorbital, or dorsal nasal arteries, among other branches of the ophthalmic artery, might result in an immediate and devastating loss of vision. We wanted to examine how much filler could block the ophthalmic artery. Materials and MethodsTwenty-nine fresh cadavers were examined. We exposed the arterial supply to the opthalmic artery by dissecting the orbital area. Thereafter, 17 filler injections were introduced into the supratrochlear, supraorbital, and dorsal nasal arteries each. The amount of filler injection that completely blocked the ophthalmic artery was measured. Additionally, one of the head specimens was processed using phosphotungstic acid-based contrast enhancement micro-computed tomography to analyze each arteries to obstruct its whole ophthalmic artery. ResultsThe supratrochlear, supraorbital, and dorsal nasal arteries had mean volumes in milliliter (mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation) of 0.0397 & PLUSMN; 0.010 mL, 0.0409 & PLUSMN; 0.00932 mL, and 0.0368 & PLUSMN; 0.00732 mL, respectively. However, the arteries did not differ significantly. ConclusionEven a modest amount of filler injection can completely block the ophthalmic artery, resulting in visual loss.

We extend this literature by investigating how fixture shape, an important environmental factor that has received little attention in previous studies, can influence consumer purchase intentions at retail checkout. Findings from a field study and three online experiments consistently suggest that tower-shaped fixtures, in comparison to other conventional fixtures, can increase checkout purchase intentions. Moreover, the proposed effect is driven by the increased visual attention to products when displayed on tower fixtures. We also identify consumers' information processing style (i.e., more vs. less reliant on visual processing) as a theoretically relevant moderator. Specifically, customers who rely more heavily on visual information processing are more susceptible to the influence of a tower fixture than those who rely less on visual information processing. Through this research, we contribute novel insights to the understanding of display fixtures and retail operation management. This study augments the design task from product shape to fixture shape for manufacturers, and sheds light on retailer merchandising strategy as well as retail space management at checkout.

While the effects of Orientin (Ori) on osteoporosis, particularly on RANKL-stimulated osteoclast production and activation, remain still unclear, Ori has been found to display several biological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. In this work, we investigated the possible pathways through which Ori suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast development and showed for the first time that it does so. The macrophages from the bone marrow (BMMs) were cultivated and then treated with Ori after being stimulated with RANKL. Then, TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were counted, and F-actin ring analysis was used to assess Ori's impact on mature osteoclast development. In addition, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining was used to evaluate the impact of Ori on RANKL-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we performed western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR analysis to investigate probable causes of these downregulation effects. We discovered that Ori inhibits the creation of osteoclasts, the gene and protein expressions unique to osteoclasts, and the ROS production. By activating Nrf2 and other ROS-scavenging enzymes, Ori reduces intracellular ROS levels. The expression of the main transcription factor of osteoclast development, c-Fos, was downregulated together with NFATc1, CTSK, and NFATc2, thanks to Ori's inhibition of RANKL-induced NF-?B. Consistent with its in vitro antiosteoclastogenic action, Ori therapy in the ovariectomized (OVX) rat model was also able to restore bone mass and improve microarchitecture in the distal femurs. Together, our results demonstrate that Ori is a flavonoid molecule with therapeutic promise for bone illnesses associated with osteoclasts, such as osteoporosis.

PEOPLE AND NATURE			English	Article; Early Access						anthropomorphism; beaver; engagement; naming; reintroduction; renewed coexistence	ANTHROPOMORPHISM; SUCCESS; GRIEF	Individual animals are often given names by humans. For example, names are attributed to domestic animals to acknowledge their closeness to people, some research studies use names to identify differences between individuals in a study group, or zoos often use names to tell stories that attract public or media attention.Publicly naming individual animals can provide opportunities in conservation, but there are also risks. In this perspective we exemplify such opportunities and risks in the context of wildlife reintroductions. We draw on examples and observations from our experience researching Eurasian beaver Castor fiber reintroduction in England, to encourage careful thinking before publicly attributing a name to an individual in reintroduction projects.Naming individuals in reintroduction can: be a low-cost engagement tool; help people relate to unfamiliar reintroduced species; encourage local ownership of reintroduction projects; enable an effective tool for communicating information about the species and ways to coexist; or support creative or cultural expression.Yet naming individuals in reintroduction could: risk misrepresentation of natural species characteristics; make it challenging to normalise the sense that the reintroduced species is a wild animal; unintentionally imply that humans have ownership or power over the animal; cause distraction from establishing viable populations due to focus on the individual; or result in human investment in individual animals, which may have influence on reintroduction outcomes if that animal later comes to harm or dies (naturally or otherwise).Synthesis and Applications. We argue there is more to the act of naming individuals than may first appear. If considering doing so, we call for careful thought about whether it is appropriate and how to go about it. While we intentionally refrain from concluding whether 'to name or not to name', we call for careful, informative, message framing that takes advantage of the opportunities and is prepared for future circumstances, when naming of individuals does take place.

Learning by drawing and modeling: Teaching modalities for spinal anatomy in medical students	ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						anatomy; drawing; education; modeling; spine	EDUCATION; REALITY	Ongoing research has attempted to discern the optimal way to teach surgical anatomy. This study investigated the relative effectiveness of drawing and clay modeling on learning spinal anatomy among medical students. Participants were recruited from a first-year medical school class to participate in an optional educational session in their regular course schedule. Seventy-eight students participated, and 62 completed pre- and post-session tests. Participants were randomized to one of three groups, either learning spinal anatomy by (1) drawing, (2) clay modeling, or (3) reviewing a 3D anatomy application (control). All groups referenced the anatomy application; the control group had no additional learning modality. Students had 15 min to learn major anatomical structures in the lumbar spine according to their assigned modality. Learning was evaluated in terms of score differential on pre- and post-session anatomy tests, with questions focused on anatomy applied in different contexts such as pathophysiology and radiology. Improved pre- to posttest scores were expected for the drawing and modeling groups compared to control. On average, the drawing group's scores significantly improved by 11% from pre- to posttest. Scores in the clay and control groups did not significantly improve. Drawing is thus an effective strategy for learning basic and applied spinal anatomy, and drawing and clay modeling (with adequate time) may be useful for teaching medical students to apply surgical anatomical knowledge in various contexts. These modalities are generalizable to any surgical anatomical education, and should be further explored among surgical residents given their efficacy, feasibility, and minimal use of resources.

However, conventional decellularization approaches to target the removal of all cell populations including chondrocytes lead to a loss of mechanical support. We have created a partially decellularized tracheal graft (PDTG) that preserves donor chondrocytes and the mechanical properties of the trachea. In this study, we measured PDTG chondrocyte retention with a murine microsurgical model. Study DesignMurine in vivo time-point study. SettingResearch Institute affiliated with Tertiary Pediatric Hospital. MethodsPDTG was created using a sodium dodecyl sulfate protocol. Partially decellularized and syngeneic grafts were orthotopically implanted into female C57BL/6J mice. Grafts were recovered at 1, 3, and 6 months postimplant. Pre- and postimplant grafts were processed and analyzed via quantitative immunofluorescence. Chondrocytes (SOX9+, DAPI+) present in the host and graft cartilage was evaluated using ImageJ. ResultsPartial decellularization resulted in the maintenance of gross tracheal architecture with the removal of epithelial and submucosal structures on histology. All grafts demonstrated SOX9+ chondrocytes throughout the study time points. Chondrocytes in PDTG were lower at 6 months compared to preimplant and syngeneic controls. ConclusionPDTG retained donor graft chondrocytes at all time points. However, PDTG exhibits a reduction in chondrocytes at 6 months. The impact of these histologic changes on cartilage extracellular matrix regeneration and repair remains unclear.

Methods: Six major paediatric hospitals in four Australian states supplied de-identified ED data for 2011-2017 on age, sex, attendance time/date, presenting problem, injury diagnosis, triage category and mode of separation. Three hospitals supplied data on external cause and intent of injury. A machine classifier tool was used to supplement the missing external cause coding in the remaining hospitals to enable the compilation of a standardised dataset for childhood injury causes analysis. Results: A total of 486 762 ED presentations for unintentional injury in children aged 0-14 years were analysed. The leading specified cause of ED presentations was low fall (35.0%) followed by struck/collision with an object (13.8%) with little sex difference observed. Males aged 10-14 years had higher rates of motorcycle, pedal cycle and fire/flame-related injury and lower rates of horse-related injury and drug/medicinal substance poisoning compared with females. The leading specified external cause resulting in hospitalisation was low fall (32.2%) followed by struck/collision with an object (11.1%). The injuries with the highest proportion of children being hospitalised were drownings (64.4%), pedestrian (53.4%), motorcycle (52.7%) and horse-related injuries (50.0%). Conclusions: This is the first large-scale study since the 1980s to explore external causes of unintentional childhood injury presenting to Australian paediatric EDs. It demonstrates a hybrid human-machine learning approach to create a standardised database to overcome data deficiencies. The results supplement existing knowledge of hospitalised paediatric injury to better understand the causes of childhood injury by age and sex, which require health service utilisation.

Compositional shifts of alpine plant communities across the high Andes	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; community thermal scores; latitude; mountains; species richness; thermophilization; vegetation dynamics	TROPICAL ANDES; GROWTH FORM; CLIMATE; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENT; EVOLUTION; GRADIENT; FORESTS	Aim: Climate change is transforming mountain summit plant communities worldwide, but we know little about such changes in the High Andes. Understanding large-scale patterns of vegetation changes across the Andes, and the factors driving these changes, is fundamental to predicting the effects of global warming. We assessed trends in vegetation cover, species richness (SR) and community-level thermal niches (CTN) and tested whether they are explained by summits' climatic conditions and soil temperature trends.Location: High Andes.Time period: Between 2011/2012 and 2017/2019.Major taxa studied: Vascular plants.Methods: Using permanent vegetation plots placed on 45 mountain summits and soil temperature loggers situated along a similar to 6800 km N-S gradient, we measured species and their relative percentage cover and estimated CTN in two surveys (intervals between 5 and 8 years). We then estimated the annual rate of changes for the three variables and used generalized linear models to assess their relationship with annual precipitation, the minimum air temperatures of each summit and rates of change in the locally recorded soil temperatures.Results: Over time, there was an average loss of vegetation cover (mean = -0.26%/yr), and a gain in SR across summits (mean = 0.38 species m(2)/yr), but most summits had significant increases in SR and vegetation cover. Changes in SR were positively related to minimum air temperature and soil temperature rate of change. Most plant communities experienced shifts in their composition by including greater abundances of species with broader thermal niches and higher optima. However, the measured changes in soil temperature did not explain the observed changes in CTN.Main conclusions: High Andean vegetation is changing in cover and SR and is shifting towards species with wider thermal niche breadths. The weak relationship with soil temperature trends could have resulted from the short study period that only marginally captures changes in vegetation through time.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the disease and treatment-related issues affecting such patients, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to estimate the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and cognitive problems among melanoma patients, both uveal and cutaneous, before, during and after treatment. MethodsThe review was preregistered with PROSPERO (#CRD42020189847) and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive search of the literature published up until June 2022 was undertaken using PubMed, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. Two independent reviewers screened 1418 records and quality-rated included studies. The reported prevalence rates of symptoms were pooled using a random-effects model. ResultsSixty-six studies including a total of 12,400 melanoma patients published between 1992 and 2022 were included. Pooled prevalence rates ranged from 6% to 16% for depression and 7%-30% for anxiety across diagnoses (uveal and cutaneous melanoma) and assessment time points. One third of the patients (35%) reported clinically significant fatigue, 20%-44% had cognitive complaints, while prevalence of sleep disturbance was not reported. Quality assessment indicated that 80% of the studies were of good quality. ConclusionA large body of research shows that depression and anxiety symptoms are prevalent in melanoma patients before, during and after treatment. However, research examining other symptoms known to affect quality of life, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive problems, is still needed.

Hypocitraturia and Risk of Bone Disease in Patients With Kidney Stone Disease	JBMR PLUS			English	Article; Early Access						FRACTURE PREVENTION AND GENERAL POPULATION STUDIES; FRACTURE RISK ASSESSMENT; OSTEOPOROSIS; SCREENING	MINERAL DENSITY; CITRATE; BICARBONATE; EXCRETION	Patients with kidney stone disease are at higher risk for bone disease. Hypocitraturia is common in patients with kidney stone disease and a key risk factor for stone recurrence. In this retrospective cohort study, we sought to determine whether hypocitraturia is also a risk factor for incident bone disease in patients with kidney stone disease. We used nationwide data from the Veterans Health Administration and identified 9025 patients with kidney stone disease who had a 24-hour urine citrate measurement between 2007 and 2015. We examined clinical characteristics of patients by level of 24-hour urine citrate excretion (<200, 200-400, and >400 mg/d) and the time to osteoporosis or fracture according to 24-hour urine citrate excretion level. Almost one in five veterans with kidney stone disease and a 24-hour urine citrate measurement had severe hypocitraturia, defined as <200 mg/d. Patients with severe hypocitraturia were at risk for osteoporosis or fracture (hazard ratio [HR]= 1.23; confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.48), but after adjustment for demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and laboratory abnormalities associated with hypocitraturia, the association was no longer statistically significant (HR = 1.18; CI 0.98-1.43). Our results in a predominantly male cohort suggest a modest association between hypocitraturia and osteoporosis or fracture; there are likely to be other explanations for the potent association between kidney stone disease and diminished bone health.

However, such heterointerfaces are limited in scope and synthetically challenging. Herein, we applied a wet chemistry method to tunably deposit Pd and Ni on the available surfaces of porous 2D-Pt nanodendrites (NDs). Using 2D silica nanoreactors to house the 2D-PtND, an 0.5-nm-thick epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (e-Pd or e-Ni) was exclusively formed on the flat {110} surface of 2D-Pt, while a non-epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (n-Pd or n-Ni) was typically deposited at the {111/100} edge in absence of nanoreactor. Notably, these differently located Pd/Pt and Ni/Pt heterointerfaces experienced distinct electronic effect to influence unequally in electrocatalytic synergy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For instance, an enhanced H-2 generation on the Pt{110} facet with 2D-2D interfaced e-Pd deposition and faster water dissociation on the edge-located n-Ni overpowered their facet-located counterparts in respective HER catalysis. Therefore, a feasible assembling of the valuable heterointerfaces in the optimal 2D n-Ni/e-Pd/Pt catalyst overcame the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics, with a catalytic activity 7.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.

Comparison of regmed and BayesNetty for exploring causal models with many variables	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Bayesian networks; causal inference; mediation		Here we compare a recently proposed method and software package, regmed, with our own previously developed package, BayesNetty, designed to allow exploratory analysis of complex causal relationships between biological variables. We find that regmed generally has poorer recall but much better precision than BayesNetty. This is perhaps not too surprising as regmed is specifically designed for use with high-dimensional data. BayesNetty is found to be more sensitive to the resulting multiple testing problem encountered in these circumstances. However, as regmed is not designed to handle missing data, its performance is severely affected when missing data is present, whereas the performance of BayesNetty is only slightly affected. The performance of regmed can be rescued in this situation by first using BayesNetty to impute the missing data, and then applying regmed to the resulting "filled-in" data set.

Here, an ingenious approach is proposed to assemble DAs of Ni and Fe into the interlayer of MoS2. While inheriting the exceptional merits of diatomic species, this interlayer-confined structure arms itself with confinement effect, displaying the more favorable adsorption strength on the confined metal active center and higher catalytic activity towards acidic water splitting, as verified by intensive research efforts of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Moreover, the interlayer-confined structure also renders metal DAs a protective shelter to survive in harsh acidic environment. The findings embodied the confinement effects at the atom level, and interlayer-confined assembling of multiple species highlights a general pathway to advance interlayer-confined DAs catalysts within various 2D materials.

The bioinspired structures are fabricated using a simple and well-designed process that combines the conventional micro-electromechanical system process with subsequent soft lithography. Three criteria to avoid fabrication errors during silicon mold production are suggested. The fabricated silicon master serves as a reliable and robust semi-permanent mold for polymeric replication, resulting in bioinspired surfaces with high fidelity. The successfully fabricated bioinspired fabricated structure surface has a re-entrant shape line structure and exhibits directional omniphobic properties while maintaining transparency. The fabricated surface is found to transport droplets in the direction where microlines are formed without wetting by various droplets, including water and oil. The results show that this surface can be applied to various fields. This study has implications for the development of artificial surfaces inspired by nature for various fields, including microfluidics, biotechnology, and energy-harvesting devices.

In x of 59-78%, the resistivity decreases with increasing [Si] up to 4 x 10(19) cm(-3). The temperature dependence of the electron concentration and mobility disappears in the optimum doping range, characteristic of electric degeneracy. The ionization energy of isolated Si donor (E-d0) is slightly increased in the range of 60-80 meV with increasing x (59-78%). At higher [Si] than 4 x 10(19) cm(-3), self-compensation defects such as III vacancy-Si complexes are formed, resulting in higher resistivity. When x is 89%, the resistivity is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that for lower x, and the E-d0 is drastically increased to & AP;120 meV, which is a feature of a highly compensated semiconductor. Based on the increased oxygen incorporation and the distinctive defect luminescence peak for the sample with x of 89%, the formation of acceptor-type O-related defects such as O-DX and V-III-nO(N) is indicated and can contribute to a part of the electron compensation.

AimsTo analysis the clinical features of ADFK in Chinese people from current cases. MethodsFrom December 2019 to October 2021, there were 21 patients diagnosed with ADFK, we made a retrospective analysis on the clinical features of skin lesions in them. To summarize the clinical morphology, location, and surgical follow-up of ADFK. ResultsWe concluded that ADFK is more common in females than males on the hands (7:3), while the male-to-female ratio is largely the same in feet (6:5). It occurs more frequently on the third finger (60%) and first toe (45.5%). As to clinical morphology, it is typically rod-shaped (52.4%), followed by dome-shaped (42.8%) and wart-shaped (4.8%). It is typically dome-shaped on the hands (80%) and rod-shaped on the feet (81.8%). In terms of location on the fingers (toes), such skin lesions are most common at the proximal nail fold (52.4%), which can also occur at the nail matrix (14.3%), periungual area (23.8%), and subungual area (9.5%). Nevertheless, this ratio also varies on the hands and feet. All patients got surgical excision of the skin lesion, who were followed up for 6-12 months, without recurrence. ConclusionsMost ADFKs are associated with trauma, whose clinical features are related to location and gender. ADFKs on the hands are different from those on the feet regarding clinical morphology and location on fingers (toes), and surgery is effective in treating this condition.

Total urinary hydroxyproline excretion served as marker for bone resorption (BR) but was replaced by beta-CrossLaps (CTX), a C-terminal collagen alpha-1(I) chain (COL1A1) telopeptide. We investigated the low-molecular-weight urinary proteome for peptides associated with changes in bone metabolism after kidney transplantation. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data including serum levels of CTX in 96KTR from two nephrology centers were correlated with signal intensities of urinary peptides identified by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Results: Eighty-two urinary peptides were significantly correlated with serum CTX levels. COL1A1 was the predominant peptide source. Oral bisphosphonates were administered for decreased bone density in an independent group of 11 KTR and their effect was evaluated on the aforementioned peptides. Study of the peptides cleavage sites revealed a signature of Cathepsin K and MMP9. Seventeen of these peptides were significantly associated with bisphosphonate treatment, all showing a marked reduction in their excretion levels compared to baseline. Discussion: This study provides strong evidence for the presence of collagen peptides in the urine of KTR that are associated with BR and that are sensitive to bisphosphonate treatment. Their assessmentmight become a valuable tool to monitor bone status in KTR.

We described two new complementary signs to diagnose functional weakness of the lower limb, "weak gluteus maximus (weak GM)" and "weak Iliopsoas with normal gluteus maximus (weak iliopsoas with normal GM)," and tested their validity. MethodsThe tests comprised Medical Research Council (MRC) examinations of the iliopsoas and GM in the supine position. We retrospectively enrolled patients with functional weakness (FW) or structural weakness (SW) who presented with weakness of either iliopsoas or GM, or both. Weak GM means that the MRC score of GM is 4 or less. Its complementary sign, weak ilopsoas with normal GM, means that the MRC score of ilopsoas is 4 or less, whereas that of GM is 5. ResultsThirty-one patients with FW and 72 patients with SW were enrolled. The weak GM sign was positive in all 31 patients with FW and in 11 patients with SW, that is, 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Therefore, the complementary sign, weak iliopsoas with normal GM, was 100% specific for SW. DiscussionAlthough 100% should be discounted considering limitations of this study, these signs will likely be helpful in differentiating between FW and SW in the general neurology setting. Downward pressing of the lower limb to the bed in the supine position is interpreted by the patient as an active movement exerted with an effort and might be preferentially impaired in FW.

The questionnaire covered several categories: (1) demographics and general information, (2) physical conditions, (3) psychologic status and sleep quality, (4) survivor's comments on transplantation, (5) demands and needs, (6) preferred forms and channels of information.Results: Depression and poor sleep quality were major concerns troubling allo-HSCT survivors. A notable discrepancy exists between clinically diagnosed depression (4.2%) and self- reported depression based on BDI-13 (55.2%). Young adults (18-49 years old), chronic graft-versus-host disease, the ECOG performance score of 2-4, surviving within 5 years since HSCT, no or low dose of ATG used and being single were significantly associated with self-reported depression. Based on the PSQI score, 75% of survivors experienced varying degrees of sleep quality impairment. Young adults, chronic GVHD and the ECOG score of 2-4 were significantly associated with worse sleep quality. The majority of patients reported unmet needs on physical and psychosocial aspects. Nutrition information was the most important topic, followed by disease treatments and fatigue. Differences in informational needs were found in the survivors according to age, time since HSCT and gender. WeChat public account and WeChat applet, mobile interactive platform and one-to-one conversation were the favorite channel for information.Conclusions: Clinicians should establish more appropriate survivorship care plans focusing on survivors' psychologic states, demands and needs.

Coarse-grained simulations of von Willebrand factor adsorption to collagen with consequent platelet recruitment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						platelets; thrombosis; von Willebrand factor	LATTICE BOLTZMANN; ADHESIVE DYNAMICS; FACTOR MULTIMERS; BINDING; DOMAIN; IDENTIFICATION; AGGREGATION; CHAIN	A multimeric glycoprotein of blood plasma-Von Willebrand factor (VWF)-mediates platelet adhesion to the fibrillar collagen of the subendothelial matrix if the blood vessel walls are damaged. The adsorption of VWF to collagen is thus essential for the initial stages of platelet hemostasis and thrombosis, as it plays a role of a molecular bridge between the injury and platelet adhesion receptors. Biomechanical complexity and sensitivity to the hydrodynamics are inherent in this system, therefore, modern computational methods supplement experimental studies of biophysical and molecular mechanisms that underlie platelet adhesion and aggregation in the blood flow. In the present paper, we propose a simulation framework for the VWF-mediated platelet adhesion to a plane wall with immobilized binding sites for VWF under the action of shear flow. VWF multimers and platelets are represented in the model by particles connected by elastic bonds and immersed in a viscous continuum fluid. This work complements the scientific field by taking into account the shape of a flattened platelet, but keeping a compromise between the detail of the description and the computational complexity of the model.

This is first developed by constructing a nano-object on a metal tip to form a quantized double barrier structure. However, the single-electron-emission current can only achieve a picoampere level due to the low electron tunneling rate of the heterojunction with large barrier width, which limits the practical applications. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as a single-electron emitter and a current up to 1.5 nA is demonstrated. The double barrier structure formed on the CNT tip enables a high tunneling rate (& AP;10(12) s(-1)) due to the smaller barrier width. The emitter also shows high temporal coherence (energy dispersion of & AP;10 meV) and spatial coherence (effective source radius of & AP;0.85 nm). This work represents a highly coherent electron source to simplify the electron optics system of atomic-resolution electron microscopy and sub-10 nm electron beam lithography.

J	Wang, SS				Wang, Susheng			Bundling of authority and accountability in organizations	JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY			English	Article; Early Access							VIEWS	Decision-making authority is often bundled with accountability. Decision makers are usually made accountable for failure. We propose an incomplete-contract approach to investigate four accountability systems: personal accountability, no accountability, collective accountability, and reverse accountability. We consider an organization defined by three assignments: income, authority, and accountability. These assignments are endogenously and jointly determined in equilibrium. Our main findings are: (1) authority and accountability are usually, but not always, bundled in equilibrium; (2) personal accountability and collective accountability are equally efficient, and no accountability and reverse accountability are equally efficient; (3) no accountability can be optimal if the authority is quite capable; (4) control tends to be assigned to managers whose personal benefit from and the marginal cost of control are relatively small; and (5) reverse accountability is generally inferior to personal accountability, but it can be optimal if the authority is quite capable and her marginal cost and personal benefit from control are sufficiently small.

Solid polymer electrolyte yields the promise of interfacial compatibility, yet its critical bottleneck is how to simultaneously achieve high ionic conductivity and lithium-ion transference number. Herein, single-ion conducting network polymer electrolyte (SICNP) enabling fast charging is proposed to positively realize fast lithium-ion locomotion with both high ionic conductivity of 1.1 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) and lithium-ion transference number of 0.92 at room temperature. Experimental characterization and theoretical simulations demonstrate that the construction of polymer network structure for single-ion conductor not only facilitates fast hopping of lithium ions for boosting ionic kinetics, but also enables a high dissociation level of the negative charge for lithium-ion transference number close to unity. As a result, the solid-state lithium batteries constructed by coupling SICNP with lithium anodes and various cathodes (e.g., LiFePO4, sulfur, and LiCoO2) display impressive high-rate cycling performance (e.g., 95% capacity retention at 5 C for 1000 cycles in LiFePO4|SICNP|lithium cell) and fast-charging capability (e.g., being charged within 6 min and discharged over than 180 min in LiCoO2|SICNP|lithium cell). Our study provides a prospective direction for solid-state electrolyte that meets the lithium-ion dynamics for practical fast-charging solid-state lithium batteries.

Deep learning methods based on MRI have shown promise in cancer diagnosis and prognostication. However, the value of deep learning in rectal cancer T-staging is unclear.Purpose To develop a deep learning model based on preoperative multiparametric MRI for evaluation of rectal cancer and to investigate its potential to improve T-staging accuracy.Study Type Retrospective.Population After cross-validation, 260 patients (123 with T-stage T1-2 and 134 with T-stage T3-4) with histopathologically confirmed rectal cancer were randomly divided to the training (N = 208) and test sets (N = 52).Field Strength/Sequence 3.0 T/Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), T2-weighted imaging (T2W), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).Assessment The deep learning (DL) model of multiparametric (DCE, T2W, and DWI) convolutional neural network were constructed for evaluating preoperative diagnosis. The pathological findings served as the reference standard for T-stage. For comparison, the single parameter DL-model, a logistic regression model composed of clinical features and subjective assessment of radiologists were used.Statistical Tests The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate the models, the Fleiss' kappa for the intercorrelation coefficients, and DeLong test for compare the diagnostic performance of ROCs. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results The Area Under Curve (AUC) of the multiparametric DL-model was 0.854, which was significantly higher than the radiologist's assessment (AUC = 0.678), clinical model (AUC = 0.747), and the single parameter DL-models including T2W-model (AUC = 0.735), DWI-model (AUC = 0.759), and DCE-model (AUC = 0.789).Data Conclusion In the evaluation of rectal cancer patients, the proposed multiparametric DL-model outperformed the radiologist's assessment, the clinical model as well as the single parameter models. The multiparametric DL-model has the potential to assist clinicians by providing more reliable and precise preoperative T staging diagnosis.Evidence Level 3Technical Efficacy Stage 2	[Wei, Yaru; Chen, Zhongwei; Zhu, Ying; Pan, Kehua; Wen, Caiyun; Cao, Guoquan; He, Yun; Zhou, Jiejie; Wang, Meihao] Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yaru; Wang, Meihao] Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Lab Med & Life Sci, Wenzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haojie] Wenzhou Med Univ, Cixi Biomed Res Inst, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haojie; Li, Yingfa; Lu, Beichen; Pan, Zhifang] Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Key Lab Intelligent Med Imaging Wenzhou, Wenzhou, Peoples R China	Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University; Wenzhou Medical University	Wang, MH (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Radiol, Wenzhou, Peoples R China.; Wang, MH (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Lab Med & Life Sci, Wenzhou, Peoples R China.; Pan, ZF (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Key Lab Intelligent Med Imaging Wenzhou, Wenzhou, Peoples R China.	panzhifang@wmu.edu.cn; wzwmh@wmu.edu.cn			Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Imaging of Wenzhou [2021HZSY0057]; Key Laboratory of Alzheimer's Disease of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Aging, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LHDMY22H160004]; Wenzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau [Y2020156]	Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Imaging of Wenzhou; Key Laboratory of Alzheimer's Disease of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Aging, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Wenzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau	This work was supported by the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Medical Imaging of Wenzhou (2021HZSY0057), Key Laboratory of Alzheimer's Disease of Zhejiang Province, Institute of Aging, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China, Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LHDMY22H160004), and Wenzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau (Y2020156).		40	0	0	10	10	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1053-1807	1522-2586		J MAGN RESON IMAGING	J.

Although it has been recently implemented by adiabatically encircling the exceptional points in a non-Hermitian system, these approaches are fundamentally restricted to the adiabatic condition that brings disadvantages of low transmission efficiency and large device footprint. Here, it is proposed to realize a broadband asymmetric light transport in compact non-Hermitian coupled waveguides on the lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform. The asymmetric function is fulfilled by a particular mode selection in a loss-controlled LNOI waveguide triplet, where a lossless zero mode plays a crucial role. Moreover, the shortcut to adiabaticity is applied to speed up the light evolution and shorten the device length. The approach works out a new strategy to establish an asymmetric light transport in a compact form, indicating further new on-chip light manipulations in this promising LNOI photonic platform.

Herein, amorphous NiFe hydr(oxy)oxide nanosheet arrays (A-NiFe HNSAs) are grown in situ on the surface of a self-supporting Ni metal-organic frameworks (SNMs) electrode via a combination strategy of ion exchange and hydrolytic co-deposition for efficient and stable large-current-density water oxidation. The existence of the abundant metal-oxygen bonds on the heterointerfaces can not only be of great significance to alter the electronic structure and accelerate the reaction kinetics, but also enable the redistribution of Ni/Fe charge density to effectively control the adsorption behavior of important intermediates with a close to the optimal d-band center, dramatically narrowing the energy barriers of the OER rate-limiting steps. By optimizing the electrode structure, the A-NiFe HNSAs/SNMs-NF exhibits outstanding OER performance with small overpotentials of 223 and 251 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 36.3 mV dec(-1), and excellent durability during 120 h at 10 mA cm(-2). This work significantly provides an avenue to understand and realize rationally designed heterointerface structures toward effective oxygen evolution in water-splitting applications.

Additionally, the utilization of additive manufacturing (AM) in this venture has aroused the curiosity of investigators to empirically enumerate the characteristics of such composites for numerous applications. Consequently, this investigation aims to assess the thermal behavior of polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) polymers reinforced with graphene flakes. As mentioned above, various weight ratios of the constituents are manufactured, blended, and extruded into six distinct varieties of 3D-printable filaments utilizing a twin-screw extruder. In accordance with the relevant American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, we perform the thermal characterization of the compounded PETG/graphene pellets using Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results reveal that enhancing the concentration of graphene augments the thermal properties of the composites. Furthermore, the FTIR investigation contributes to graphene's proficiency in absorbing infrared radiation and curbing micro-vibrations. Additionally, the study highlights the way in which chemical interactions between graphene and PETG impact the general effectiveness of the composites.

Here, we subject 19 fossil and 21 contemporary specimens to stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis (after first ruling out diagenesis via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). The two groups differ in their isotopic composition (PERMANOVA, p <.01), with fossils yielding more disparate delta C-13 values and recent samples more disparate delta O-18 values.

A small body of research has so far shown that GHRM is positively related to organizational sustainability, yet the results are somewhat variable. This calls into question regarding the boundary conditions of this relationship. In this study, the moderating role of top management team (TMT) support has been examined as senior managers have a key role to play in ensuring that GHRM is valued, widely recognized, and implemented as intended. Based on the existing literature, a model has been developed and then tested with partial least square structural equation modeling, with feedback from 372 human resource managers across several organizations. The results show a positive relationship between GHRM and sustainability, and the results also show that the TMT support strengthens this relationship. Importantly, the study reveals a positive and significant relationship between sustainability and organizational performance.

Despite the development of new drugs and treatments in recent years, the therapeutic outcomes of patients are not satisfactory. It is necessary to further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying MM progression. Herein, we found that high E2F2 expression was correlated with poor overall survival and advanced clinical stages in MM patients. Gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that E2F2 inhibited cell adhesion and consequently activated cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration. Further experiments revealed that E2F2 interacted with the PECAM1 promoter to suppress its transcriptional activity. The E2F2-knockdown-mediated promotion of cell adhesion was significantly reversed by the repression of PECAM1 expression. Finally, we observed that silencing E2F2 significantly inhibited viability and tumour progression in MM cell models and xenograft mouse models respectively. This study demonstrates that E2F2 plays a vital role as a tumour accelerator by inhibiting PECAM1-dependent cell adhesion and accelerating MM cell proliferation. Therefore, E2F2 may serve as a potential independent prognostic marker and therapeutic target for MM.

Rationality polarizes policy support for colour blindness versus multiculturalism	BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						analytic thinking; colour blindness; ideology; intergroup relations; multiculturalism; polarization; rationality	SOCIAL-DOMINANCE ORIENTATION; COGNITIVE REFLECTION; IDEOLOGY; AUTHORITARIANISM; DIVERSITY; JUSTIFICATION; DIMENSIONS; PREJUDICE; ATTITUDES; IMPACT	Do White Americans prefer society to be 'colour-blind' by rising above racial identities, or 'multicultural' by openly discussing and considering them? We developed an ideology-rationality model to understand support for these diversity perspectives. Specifically, since people endorse a diversity perspective in line with their ideological values, we hypothesized that conservatism is related to a relative preference for colour blindness over multiculturalism. However, since colour blindness and multiculturalism are complex and multi-layered ideologies, we further hypothesized that the relationship between conservatism and a preference for colour blindness over multiculturalism is especially pronounced under higher levels of rationality. Results confirmed the hypotheses, either when rationality was operationalized within a dual process theory (Study 1, N = 496) or experimentally induced within a tripartite model of cognition (Study 2, N = 497). Higher levels of rationality guided White Americans high in conservatism towards a stronger preference for colour-blindness, but those low in conservatism towards a stronger preference for multiculturalism. These results suggest that among White Americans the endorsement of colour blindness versus multiculturalism stems from the interplay between ideological orientation and rationality and that rational considerations about racial policies may further divide rather than unify along ideological lines.

Participants were aged =50 years (n = 171) with a body mass index =28 kg/m(2) and radiographic medial tibiofemoral OA. Participants in the intervention group received diet and exercise programs and special treatment (cognitive behavioral therapy, knee brace, and muscle strengthening exercises) according to the disease remission. Remission of pain and remission of patient global assessment of disease activity and/or functional impairment were used to define the disease remission. The control group were provided with an education pamphlet. The primary outcome was disease remission at 32 weeks, and the secondary outcomes were the changes in knee pain and physical function at 20 and 32 weeks. Baseline JSN was scored from 0 to 3, and the association between baseline JSN and outcomes was assessed using multiple regression.Results: There was no association of baseline JSN with disease remission at 32 weeks when the disease remission has been achieved. The baseline JSN grade 3 was associated with changes in knee pain at 20 weeks (p < .05). There was no association between baseline JSN and physical function.Conclusion: Baseline JSN severity predicted changes in knee pain but not the disease remission or changes in physical functions. Identification of baseline radiographic severity may be helpful in identifying differences in response to diet and exercise programs in knee OA.

What has philosophy ever done for nursing: A discursive shift from margins to mainstream	NURSING PHILOSOPHY			English	Article						critical feminist; emancipatory; health inequities; nursing philosophy	COMPASSION; NURSES; DISCOURSE; BIOPOWER	This paper is a personal dialogue of maneuvering the landscape of scholarship in the United States as a nurse faculty. The principal thesis of this paper is that a discursive shift from margins to mainstream literature has occurred within nursing discourse during the past 20 years as the result of a growing body of work by nurse philosophers. I utilize my own work in nursing philosophy as an exemplar and provide a narrative situated in a feminist-critical paradigm. This paper: (1) presents a historical background through a critical-feminist lens of the discursive shift using my own work and lived experiences as exemplars; (2) examines a contemporary mainstream 'authoritative' text as an exemplar of this discursive shift and (3) proposes both potential positive intersections and threats in the future development of nursing philosophy resulting from this discursive shift.

Various signal-processing algorithms are used for this purpose. The accuracy of these algorithms is inter alia restricted by the axial symmetry of the signals. However, in practice response signals are rather asymmetrical especially in case of measurement objects with critical surface structures such as edges or steep flanks. We present a novel signal-processing algorithm based on an exponential function with a cubic argument to handle asymmetrical and also symmetrical depth response signals. Results obtained by this algorithm are compared to those of commonly used signal processing algorithms. It turns out that the novel algorithm is more robust, more accurate and exhibits a repeatability of a similar order compared to other algorithms.

This article examines two types from each group of variations that are most commonly found in digital printing systems: blotches and streaks, where amplitude and size were varied. Three most commonly used methods for measuring the print nonuniformity were used: Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), ISO 13660 and Integration (also Improved Integration) method. The results obtained by measuring were compared with a visual assessment to find the link between objective and subjective analysis and to define and determine which method/parameter is the best for the measurement of which type of print (non)uniformity. The obtained results indicate the possibility of selecting the measurement parameter, but that the choice of the parameter depends on the type of nonuniformity. It is concluded that in the case of the GLCM method, the entropy and energy parameters are strongly related to the visual assessment for all three sets of samples. These parameters can be used regardless of the type of nonuniformity. The ISO G parameter can be used to measure both graininess and mottling, while the ISO M parameter is only suitable for measuring mottling. Integration method could be used to measure systematic error. On the basis of conclusions of the research, it is possible to propose the development of an industrially applicable solution for measuring print nonuniformity of digitally printed samples.

Herein, a novel metasurface plasmon-etch immunosensor is described, namely a nanozyme-linked immunosorbent surface plasmon resonance biosensor, for the ultrasensitive and specific detection of cancer biomarkers. Gold-silver composite nano cup array metasurface plasmon resonance chip and artificial nanozyme-labeled antibody are used in two-way sandwich analyte detection. Changes in the biosensor's absorption spectrum are measured before and after chip surface etching, which can be applied to immunoassays without requiring separation or amplification. The device achieved a limit of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) detection < 21.74 fM, three orders of magnitude lower than that of commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Additionally, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) are used for quantitative detection to verify the universality of the platform. More importantly, the accuracy of the platform is verified using 60 clinical samples; compared with the hospital results, the three biomarkers achieve high sensitivity (CEA: 95.7%; CA125: 90.9%; AFP: 86.7%) and specificity (CEA: 97.3%; CA125: 93.9%; AFP: 97.8%). Due to its rapidity, ease of use, and high throughput, the platform has the potential for high-throughput rapid detection to facilitate cancer screening or early diagnostic testing in biosensing.

However, controlling the enantioselectivity in these processes remains a challenge. Here, we report an unprecedented enantioselective XEC of & alpha;-amino acid derivatives with aryl bromides, enabled by alcohols as reducing agents via Ni/photoredox catalysis. This mechanistically distinct approach exploits the ability of photocatalytically generated & alpha;-hydroxyalkyl radicals to convert alkyl electrophiles to the corresponding alkyl radicals that are then enantioselectively coupled with aryl bromides. The readily scalable protocol allows modular access to valuable enantioenriched benzylic amines from abundant and inexpensive precursors, and is applicable to late-stage diversification with broad functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies rationalize the versatility of this alcohol-based reactivity for radical generation and subsequent asymmetric cross-coupling. We expect that this alcohol-based cross-coupling will render a general platform for the development of appealing yet challenging enantioselective XECs.

Strongyle egg reappearance periods following moxidectin treatment in horses in Southeast England	EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						horse; anthelmintic resistance; egg reappearance period; moxidectin	LACTONE RESISTANT CYATHOSTOMINS; ANTHELMINTIC RESISTANCE; IVERMECTIN; EFFICACY; INFECTIONS	Background: A reduction in the egg reappearance period (ERP) has been suggested to be an early indication of emerging anthelmintic resistance in strongyles. Objective: To measure the strongyle ERP following moxidectin treatment of horses in the southeast of England. Study design: Prospective study. Methods: Horses with a faecal egg count (FEC) of >= 400 strongyle eggs per gram (EPG) in a routine screening sample were enrolled into the study. Moxidectin (400 mu g/kg) was administered per os and FEC tests repeated every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. Results: Forty-eight horses completed the study. The mean EPG prior to treatment was 1047 (range 375-2137 EPG). In all but two horses, FEC was 0 EPG 2 weeks after moxidectin administration. In the remaining two, the FECs were each 12.5 EPG (97.8%-98.3% reductions compared to pre-treatment FEC). At 4 weeks post-treatment, 6 horses had positive FECs (96.6%-99.2% reductions). At 6 weeks, 11 horses had positive FECs (83.8% reduction in one horse; >90% reduction in 10). At 8 weeks, 21 horses exhibited positive FECs (<90% reduction in 2). At 10 weeks, 27 horses had positive FECs (<90% in 6). At 12 weeks, 31 horses had positive FECs (<90% reduction in 11). At 14 weeks, 34 horses had positive FECs (<90% reduction in 13). At 16 weeks, 38 horses had positive FECs (<90% reduction in 17). Main limitations: Weights of some horses were estimated using weigh tapes rather than a weighbridge. Dosing of the horses with moxidectin was carried out by owners. Conclusions: The results indicated acceptable efficacy of moxidectin at 14 days after treatment; however, the ERP pattern measured across the group suggests that this anthelmintic has a considerably shorter suppressive effect on strongyle egg shedding than measured when it was first introduced (12-16 weeks).

Optimization of the product quality based on orthogonal experiments on the four fermentation conditions ensure that the product still has good sensory properties when stored during its shelf life at room temperature. The optimal fermentation conditions based on the range analysis are the mass ratio of glutinous rice, corn and rice 8:1:1, L. acidophilus inoculum of 8%, fermentation temperature of 37 & DEG;C, and fermentation time of 28 h. Under this condition, rice products' hardness, viscosity, elasticity, cohesiveness, and taste significantly increase compared to the spontaneously fermented products. The pasting characteristics, water absorption index, thermodynamic properties, short-range ordered structure, and microstructure of two kinds of fermented rice flours are analyzed. L. acidophilus fermented rice flour is more prone to pasting and ageing, with a higher proportion of short-chain amylopectin in starch and lower final viscosity and water absorption, with a denser and smoother internal structure. In conclusion, fermentation improves the properties of glutinous rice flour and its products, and L. acidophilus fermentation is more effective than spontaneous fermentation.

Evaluating the performance of anal cytology and high-risk HPV genotyping for detecting anal HSIL in a clinic-based sample of people living with and without HIV in Puerto Rico	CANCER CYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						anal cancer screening; anal cytology; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions; HR-HPV genotyping; HR-HPV infection; HR-HPV test; Puerto Rico	SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESIONS; HIGH-RESOLUTION ANOSCOPY; WOMEN; RECOMMENDATIONS; AGREEMENT; HISTOLOGY; NEOPLASIA	BackgroundGiven the disproportionately elevated anal cancer risk in high-risk populations, it is important to assess the performance of commonly used anal cancer screening tools to improve the effectiveness of detection and treatment methods. This study evaluates 1) the concordance between anal cytology and histology results and 2) the performance of cytology and high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) genotyping as screening tools for detecting histologically confirmed anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). MethodsData from the Anal Neoplasia Clinic in Puerto Rico (2014-2021; n = 466) was used. The clinical performance of anal cytology and HR-HPV genotyping to detect HSIL was compared to the gold standard: high-resolution anoscopy-guided biopsy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and & kappa; coefficients were calculated. ResultsA total of 66.95% of the patients were men, 74.0% were people living with HIV, 76.2% had anal HR-HPV infection, and 40.34% had histologically confirmed anal HSIL. The weighted & kappa; statistic between the tests (cytology and histology) was 0.25 (p < .001). The sensitivity and specificity of cytology alone to detect anal HSIL were 84.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.3%-89.1%) and 36.0% (95% CI, 30.3%-42.0%), respectively. Anal HR-HPV genotyping had higher sensitivity (92.2%; 95% CI, 87.4%-95.6%) and similar specificity (34.8%; 95% CI, 29.2%-40.7%) compared to cytology. The two tests combined (positive results following cytology or HR-HPV test) improved sensitivity to detect anal HSIL (97.9%; 95% CI, 94.8%-99.4%), but specificity was compromised (19.2%; 95% CI, 14.7%-24.4%). ConclusionAlthough HR-HPV genotyping improved the detection of anal HSIL, HR-HPV testing had lower specificity than anal cytology alone.

However, understanding the lake sedimentation state to link catchment pressures and biogenic regime shifts remains challenging. To address this, research was conducted on the lake sedimentation state, including the dynamics, catchment drivers, effects on biogenic regimes, and responses to typical historical events using nine sediment cores from Dongting Lake, China, a typical global priority ecoregion. Three transitions of lake sedimentation state were distinguished over the century (1937, 1968, and 1993), whereby hydrologic dynamics and land-use changes in the watershed were the direct drivers with relative contributions of 16.30% and 14.56%, respectively. Lake sedimentation state and organic matter inputs not only preceded sediment biogenic elements at the shift time but also exhibited nonlinear trigger effects on biogenic element contents (R-2 = 0.47, p < 0.01), which promoted an increase in sediment biogenic element burial rates. Rate of change analysis indicated that intensive human activities altered the relationship between the sedimentation state and biogenic regime shift, thus revealing the response to anthropogenic events in the catchment. Pathways quantified by the partial least squares path model established the link between watershed attributes and lake biogenic properties via the lake sedimentation state. Our findings revealed a cascading linkage among catchment eco-surroundings, lake sedimentation states, and biogenic regime shifts. The research further provided insights into driver-response relationships in lake-catchment systems.

Design: An integrative literature review was conducted using Whittemore and Knalf integrative review methods. Data sources: A search of the literature from Medline (PubMed) and CINHAL platform for abstracts and/or full-text articles from 2012 to 2022. Methods: A systematic approach was used to screen and analyse the literature. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, a quality appraisal of the literature was undertaken and summarised into themes. Eighteen articles were selected, two articles were different aspects of the same studies. Coaching was found to have benefits to the individual related to performance, role effectiveness, role transitions and confidence in performing in the role. The outcomes for individuals add to the overall organisational benefits with performance, support, teamwork, communication and culture. Results: This literature review sought to understand the current use of coaching in nursing and identify any gaps in the application of coaching within the discipline. Supporting, developing staff knowledge and skills and nurturing nursing staff into the profession has occurred in several ways and evolved to include coaching. Coaching provides capabilities to enhance nursing leadership, performance improvement and to provide support to staff. The findings from this literature review found a need to conceptually define coaching in nursing and the opportunity to explore the use of coaching to support both the clinical and managerial workforce (job satisfaction, intention to stay and building resilience). The benefits of coaching in nursing extend beyond the leadership level and there is opportunity to extend the operationalisation of coaching practice and coaching training within the discipline of nursing. This integrative review explains how coaching has been utilised in nursing to be a valuable tool in developing nurse leaders and clinical staff.

The pairwise similarity between structural models is proven useful for estimating the quality of protein tertiary structural models, but it has been rarely applied to predicting the quality of quaternary structural models. Moreover, the pairwise similarity approach often fails when many structural models are of low quality and similar to each other. To address the gap, we developed a hybrid method (MULTICOM_qa) combining a pairwise similarity score (PSS) and an interface contact probability score (ICPS) based on the deep learning inter-chain contact prediction for estimating protein complex model accuracy. It blindly participated in the 15th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15) in 2022 and performed very well in estimating the global structure accuracy of assembly models. The average per-target correlation coefficient between the model quality scores predicted by MULTICOM_qa and the true quality scores of the models of CASP15 assembly targets is 0.66. The average per-target ranking loss in using the predicted quality scores to rank the models is 0.14. It was able to select good models for most targets. Moreover, several key factors (i.e., target difficulty, model sampling difficulty, skewness of model quality, and similarity between good/bad models) for EMA are identified and analyzed. The results demonstrate that combining the multi-model method (PSS) with the complementary single-model method (ICPS) is a promising approach to EMA.

Clinical signs are associated with neck stiffness and forelimb ataxia. In other species, treatment consists mainly of antibiotics coupled with non-steroidal analgesics for a period of 3-12 weeks. An inadequate response to conservative treatment requires surgical intervention, but there is limited information in the literature regarding surgical management in large animals. A 3-year-old Quarter Horse gelding presented for an approximately 4-week history of generalised stiffness and reluctance to move. Computed tomography with myelogram revealed abnormalities consistent with discospondylitis at the level of the seventh cervical and first thoracic vertebrae (C7-T1). The patient underwent cervical vertebral interbody fusion using a combination of compression of the vertebral bodies using cortical screws in lag fashion and a 4-hole locking compression plate (LCP). The patient was discharged from the hospital with marked improvement. At the time of this report, 4 months after the procedure, the horse continues to show marked improvement in mobility and range of motion.

We aimed to compare AF burden in patients with high atrial septal pacing (HASp) via delivery catheter and right atrial appendage pacing (RAAp) in patients with sick sinus syndrome (SSS). MethodsWe retrospectively identified 109 patients with a history of paroxysmal AF and SSS who had received dual-chamber pacemaker implantation between January 2017 and December 2019, of whom 39 and 70 patients had HASp and RAAp, respectively. rATP was initiated after a 1-month post-implantation run-in period. ResultsPatients with HASp had a significantly shorter P-wave duration during atrial pacing than those with RAAp (99.3 & PLUSMN; 10.4 vs. 116.0 & PLUSMN; 14.3 ms, p < .001). During the 3-year follow-up period, the incidence of an AF lasting longer than 1 or 7 days was significantly lower (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; p = .016; HR, 0.24; p = .004) than in those with RAAp. The median time of AF/AT per day in the follow-up periods was significantly shorter in the HASp group than in the RAAp group (10 vs. 18 min/day, p = .018). Atrial lead division did not occur in the HASp group during the follow-up period. ConclusionsHASp via delivery catheter is as safe as RAAp, and HASp combined with rATP is effective for reducing AF burden in patients with SSS and paroxysmal AF.

Then, it surface was modified by 3-choloropropyltrimtoxysilane, and further 1,3-bis(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)thiourea was anchored on the modified boehmite nanoparticles. In the final step, a neodymium complex was stabilized on its surface (Nd-bis(PYT)@boehmite NPs). The obtained nanoparticles were characterized by TGA, BET, ICP, EDS, WDX, SEM, and XRD techniques. In the second part, Nd-bis(PYT)@boehmite NPs were employed as an efficient, recoverable, and organic-inorganic hybrid nanocatalyst in the homo-selective synthesis of tetrazole compounds. The chemo-selectivity of Nd-bis(PYT)@boehmite NPs was studied in the [3+ 2] cycloaddition of phthalonitrile and sodium azide (NaN3).

Fish feces reveal diverse nutrient sources for coral reefs	ECOLOGY			English	Article						consumers; coral reefs; egestion; feces; nutrient cycling; reef fish	DYNAMICS; CONSUMPTION; COLLAPSE; NITROGEN; CLIMATE; PROTEIN; GROWTH; TISSUE; FOOD	Consumers mediate nutrient cycling through excretion and egestion across most ecosystems. In nutrient-poor tropical waters such as coral reefs, nutrient cycling is critical for maintaining productivity. While the cycling of fish-derived inorganic nutrients via excretion has been extensively investigated, the role of egestion for nutrient cycling has remained poorly explored. We sampled the fecal contents of 570 individual fishes across 40 species, representing six dominant trophic guilds of coral reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia. We measured fecal macro- (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids) and micro- (calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, zinc) nutrients and compared the fecal nutrient quantity and quality across trophic guilds, taxa, and body size. Macro- and micronutrient concentrations in fish feces varied markedly across species. Genera and trophic guild best predicted fecal nutrient concentrations. In addition, nutrient composition in feces was unique among species within both trophic guilds (herbivores and corallivores) and genera (Acanthurus and Chaetodon). Particularly, certain coral reef fishes (e.g., Thalassoma hardwicke, Chromis xanthura, Chaetodon pelewensis and Acanthurus pyroferus) harbored relatively high concentrations of micronutrients (e.g., Mn, Mg, Zn and Fe, respectively) that are known to contribute to ocean productivity and positively impact coral physiological performances. Given the nutrient-rich profiles across reef fish feces, conserving holistic reef fish communities ensures the availability of nutritional pools on coral reefs. We therefore suggest that better integration of consumer egestion dynamics into food web models and ecosystem-scale processes will facilitate an improved understanding of coral reef functioning.

Within the realm of programmed cell death, a recently recognized process known as necroptosis has garnered attention for its involvement in numerous inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, its correlation with periodontitis is indistinct. Our study aimed to identify necroptosis-related lncRNAs and crucial lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes in periodontitis to further understand the pathogenesis of periodontitis. Materials and MethodsGene expression profiles in gingival tissues were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Selecting hub necroptosis-related lncRNA and extracting the key lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes based on the ceRNA network by adding novel machine-learning models based on conventional analysis and combining qRT-PCR validation. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was constructed for lncRNA in regulatory axes, and the accuracy of the model was validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The clinical effect of the model was evaluated by decision curve analysis (DCA). Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was performed to explore how these lncRNAs work in periodontitis. ResultsSeven hub necroptosis-related lncRNAs and three lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes (RP11-138A9.1/hsa-miR-98-5p/ZBP1 axis, RP11-96D1.11/hsa-miR-185-5p/EZH2 axis, and RP4-773 N10.4/hsa-miR-21-5p/TLR3 axis) were predicted. WGCNA revealed that RP11-138A9.1 was significantly correlated with the "purple module". Functional enrichment analysis and ssGSEA demonstrated that the RP11-138A9.1/hsa-miR-98-5p/ZBP1 axis is closely related to the inflammation and immune processes in periodontitis. ConclusionOur study predicted a crucial necroptosis-related regulatory axis (RP11-138A9.1/hsa-miR-98-5p/ZBP1) based on the ceRNA network, which may aid in elucidating the role and mechanism of necroptosis in periodontitis.

Tdap is approved for revaccinating adult HCT recipients in the United States, whereas DTaP is not approved in this population. To our knowledge, no studies to date have compared responses to DTaP versus Tdap in adult HCT patients. We conducted a retrospective study comparing responses to DTaP versus Tdap vaccines in otherwise similar adult HCT patients in order to determine if one of these vaccines elicits superior antibody responses.Methods: We evaluated 43 allogeneic and autologous transplant recipients as a combined cohort and as separate subsets for vaccine specific antibody titers and proportion of strong vaccine responders. Subset analysis focused on the autologous transplant recipients.Results: Higher median antibody titers were found to all vaccine components among DTaP recipients (diphtheria p = .021, pertussis p = .020, tetanus p = .007). DTaP recipients also had more strong responders to diphtheria and pertussis (diphtheria p = .002, pertussis p = .006). Among the autologous HCT recipient subset, there were more strong responders to diphtheria (p = .036).Conclusions: Our data shows that post-HCT vaccination with DTaP leads to higher antibody titers and more strong responders, which suggests that DTaP is more effective than Tdap in HCT recipients.

The catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, SEM-EDS, Raman, XPS, FTIR, UV-Vis, etc. The results show that N-TiO2 photocatalyst has a larger specific surface area, stable anatase phase, and narrow forbidden band energy (3.17-3.24 eV). The N-doped TiO2 has more oxygen vacancies (OVs) than pure TiO2, as confirmed by results such as XPS and ESR. The photocatalytic evaluation results show that the decolorization of methyl orange reached 99.03 % over the 3 % N-doped TiO2, which is 40 % higher than that of pure TiO2. Meanwhile, 3 % N-doped TiO2 exhibited a faster MO mineralisation rate than TiO2. After repeatedly used for 5 times, the photocatalyst 3-N-TiO2 still showed high activity in the degradation of MO. The improvement of the visible light performance of the N-TiO2 photocatalyst could be attributed to the introduction of N in TiO2 to generate new N 2p energy levels and rich OVs.

Children can represent complex social status hierarchies: Evidence from Indonesia	CHILD DEVELOPMENT			English	Article; Early Access							RACE; ASPIRATIONS; ATTITUDES; IMPLICIT	Children's ethnicity-status associations are often studied in societies where one ethnic group possesses status across multiple dimensions, such as political influence and wealth. This study examined children's (6-12 years) and adults' representations of more complex hierarchies in Indonesia (N = 341; 38% Native Indonesian, 33% Chinese Indonesian, and 27% other ethnicities; 55% female, 36% male; 2021-2022), a society where ethnic groups hold distinct forms of status (on average, Native Indonesians have political influence; Chinese Indonesians have wealth). By 6.5 years, children associated Native Indonesians with political influence and Chinese Indonesians with wealth.

It remains poorly understood the unique properties a coherent interface between crystalline and amorphous materials may evoke, and there lacks a general strategy to fabricate such interfaces. It is demonstrated that by topotactic partial oxidation heterostructures composed of coherently registered crystalline and amorphous materials can be constructed. As a proof-of-concept study, heterostructures consisting of crystalline P3N5 and amorphous P3N5Ox can be synthesized by creating amorphous P3N5Ox from crystalline P3N5 without interrupting the covalent bonding across the coherent interface. The heterostructure is dictated by nanometer-sized short-range-ordered P3N5 domains enclosed by amorphous P3N5Ox matrix, which entails simultaneously fast charge transfer across the interface and bicomponent synergistic effect in catalysis. Such a P3N5/P3N5Ox heterostructure attains an optimal adsorption energy for *OOH intermediates and exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance toward H2O2 production by adopting a selectivity of 96.68% at 0.4 V-RHE and a production rate of 321.5 mmol h(-1) g(catalyst)(-1) at -0.3 V-RHE. The current study provides new insights into the synthetic strategy, chemical structure, and catalytic property of a sub-nanometer coherent interface formed between crystalline and amorphous materials.

The rheological properties of the anode ink for microextrusion printing are experimentally measured at various temperatures, and it is found that the viscosity of the ink and the wettability of the ink to the anode substrate decrease at lower temperatures, which is desirable for the ink to retain its shape on the substrate. The anode-supported SOFC button cells are fabricated by microextrusion printing with and without temperature control and compared in terms of their interfacial structures and electrochemical performance. The aspect ratio of the interfacial structure is increased from 0.16 to 0.28 by lowering the ink temperature, resulting in a higher interface enlargement of 25%. Owing to the enlarged interfacial area, enhanced cell performance is also achieved.

From optimizing workouts to risk management of cardiovascular diseases and monitoring prediabetes, the ability of sweat sensors to continuously and noninvasively measure biomarkers in real-time has a wide range of applications. Conventional sweat sensors utilize external stimulation of sweat glands to obtain samples, however; this stimulation influences the expression profile of the biomarkers and reduces the accuracy of the detection method. To address this limitation, our laboratory pioneered the development of the passive sweat sensor subfield, which allowed for our progress in developing a sweat chemistry panel. Passive sweat sensors utilize nanoporous structures to confine and detect biomarkers in ultra-low sweat volumes. The ability of passive sweat sensors to use smaller samples than conventional sensors enable users with sedentary lifestyles who perspire less to benefit from sweat sensor technology not previously afforded to them. Herein, the mechanisms and strategies of current sweat sensors are summarized with an emphasis on the emerging subfield of passive sweat-based diagnostics. Prospects for this technology include discovering new biomarkers expressed in sweat and expanding the list of relevant detectable biomarkers. Moreover, the accuracy of biomarker detection can be enhanced with machine learning using prediction algorithms trained on clinical data. Applying this machine learning in conjunction with multiplex biomarker detection will allow for a more holistic approach to trend predictions.This article is categorized under:Diagnostic Tools > Diagnostic NanodevicesNanotechnology Approaches to Biology > Nanoscale Systems in BiologyDiagnostic Tools > Biosensing	[Greyling, Cornelia Felicia; Ganguly, Antra; Churcher, Nathan Kodjo Mintah; Lin, Kai-Chun; Prasad, Shalini] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Bioengn, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA; [Sardesai, Abha Umesh] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Comp Engn, Richardson, TX USA; [Muthukumar, Sriram] EnLiSense LLC, Allen, TX USA	University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas	Prasad, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Bioengn, 800 W Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.	shalini.prasad@utdallas.edu		Ganguly, Antra/0000-0002-0776-0008					93	0	0	31	31	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	1939-5116	1939-0041		WIRES NANOMED NANOBI	Wiley Interdiscip.

However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this Review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self-driving material development, Z-scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier-material matching. Finally, we discuss essential future research directions in the field. Through this comprehensive Review, we aim to provide strategic guidance for the development of efficient overall PCRR systems.

Evaluating the stress of root canal treatment in patients and dentists compared to other dental treatments: A systematic review and meta-analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCES			English	Review						dental anxiety; dentistry; endodontics; occupational stress; psychological; stress	SALIVARY CORTISOL; TOOTH EXTRACTION; ORAL-HEALTH; ANXIETY; FEAR; STUDENTS; QUALITY; RETREATMENT; CONFIDENCE; RESPONSES	This systematic review aimed to investigate whether root canal treatment caused greater stress than other dental treatments for patients and dentists. All peer-reviewed literature published in English between January 1990 and January 2023 was included. This included randomized/non-randomized control trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies. An electronic search used PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Cochrane Collaboration, and Embase. Hand searching supplemented the screening pool. Studies examining physiological or psychological stress measures within patients or providers of dental treatment (dentists, dental specialists, and dental students) were eligible. The study must have reported on the stress outcome for root canal treatment and at least one other dental procedure. After screening 3639 eligible records, there were 23 studies included, varying from very-low to low certainty of evidence. This review found that root canal treatment was more psychologically stressful for patients than routine restorative or cleaning procedures. However, the stress of root canal treatment relative to other dental procedures, especially extractions, was inconclusive for both dental patients and providers. Since patients regard root canal treatment as more stress-evoking than other routine dental procedures, providers should endeavour to minimise their own bias toward root canal treatment when providing adequate information for an informed treatment choice.

However, the effect and mechanism of PLAP-1/Asporin on the mutual regulation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in periodontitis are not clear. In this study, we utilized a PLAP-1/Asporin gene knockout (KO) mouse model to research this unknown issue. We cultured mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (P.g. LPS) for osteogenic induction in vitro. The molecular mechanism of PLAP-1/Asporin in the regulation of osteoblasts was detected by immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and inhibitors of signaling pathways. The results showed that the KO of PLAP-1/Asporin promoted osteogenic differentiation through transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-& beta;1)/Smad3 in inflammatory environments. We further found the KO of PLAP-1/Asporin inhibited osteoclast differentiation and promoted osteogenic differentiation through the TGF-& beta;1/Smad signaling pathway in an inflammatory coculture system. The experimental periodontitis model was established by silk ligation and the alveolar bone formation in PLAP-1/Asporin KO mice was promoted through TGF-& beta;1/Smad3 signaling pathway. The subcutaneous osteogenesis model in nude mice also confirmed that the KO of PLAP-1/Asporin promoted bone formation by the histochemical staining. In conclusion, PLAP-1/Asporin regulated the differentiation of osteoclasts and osteoblasts through TGF-& beta;1/Smad signaling pathway. The results of this study lay a theoretical foundation for the further study of the pathological mechanism underlying alveolar bone resorption, and the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

In sericulture, only the first filial generation (F-1) hybrid eggs produced by cross-breeding Japanese and Chinese original strains are usually used for the large-scale breeding of silkworms, but this may result in uncontrolled transgene dispersal during the popularization and application of the F-1 hybrid transgenic eggs. To address this issue, we developed a safe and efficient strategy using the GAL4/Upstream activating sequence (UAS) system, the FLP/flippase recognition target (FRT) system, and the gonad-specific expression gene promoters (RSHP1p and Nanosp) for the germ cell-specific automatic excision of foreign DNA in the F-1 hybrid transgenic silkworms. We established 2 types of activator strains, R1p::GAL4-Gr and Nsp::GAL4-Gr, containing the testis-specific GAL4 gene expression cassettes driven by RSHP1p or Nanosp, respectively, and 1 type of effector strain, UAS::FLP-Rg, containing the UAS-linked FLP gene expression cassette. The FLP recombinase-mediated sperm-specific complete excision of FRT-flanked target DNA in the F-1 double-transgenic silkworms resulting from the hybridization of R1p::GAL4-Gr and UAS::FLP-Rg was 100%, whereas the complete excision efficiency resulting from the hybridization of Nsp::GAL4-Gr and UAS::FLP-Rg ranged from 13.73% to 80.3%. Additionally, we identified a gene, sw11114, that is expressed in both testis and ovary of Bombyx mori, and can be used to establish novel gonad-specific expression systems in transgenic silkworms. This strategy has the potential to fundamentally solve the safety issue in the production of F-1 transgenic silkworm eggs and provides an important reference for the safety of transgenic technology in other insect species.

Patient-derived xenograft models of ALK plus ALCL reveal preclinical promise for therapy with brigatinib	BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						ALCL; brigatinib; crizotinib; PDX; tyrosine kinase inhibitors	LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA; LUNG-CANCER; SOLID TUMORS; OPEN-LABEL; CRIZOTINIB; MUTATIONS; RESISTANCE; ALECTINIB; CHILDREN; STAT3	Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a T-cell malignancy predominantly driven by the oncogenic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), accounting for approximately 15% of all paediatric non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) relapse are particularly difficult to treat with a 3-year overall survival of 49% and a median survival of 23.5 months. The second-generation ALK inhibitor brigatinib shows superior penetration of the blood-brain barrier unlike the first-generation drug crizotinib and has shown promising results in ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer. However, the benefits of brigatinib in treating aggressive paediatric ALK+ ALCL are largely unknown. We established a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) resource from ALK+ ALCL patients at or before CNS relapse serving as models to facilitate the development of future therapies. We show in vivo that brigatinib is effective in inducing the remission of PDX models of crizotinib-resistant (ALK C1156Y, TP53 loss) ALCL and furthermore that it is superior to crizotinib as a second-line approach to the treatment of a standard chemotherapy relapsed/refractory ALCL PDX pointing to brigatinib as a future therapeutic option.

A simple microvoiding kinetic model that incorporates both mass transfer of the reaction product Si(OH)(4)(g) through the external gas phase boundary layer and pore diffusion of Si(OH)(4)(g) through the microvoided layer has been developed. Model predictions are in good agreement with measured growth rates of microvoided layers under low-flowrate steam furnace test and high-flowrate burner rig conditions. Since pore diffusion is generally the rate-limiting step for EBC microvoiding in turbine engines, furnace testing under conditions of kinetic control by gas phase mass transfer is not generally capable of predicting REDS microvoiding rates under engine conditions. The kinetic model can be extended to incorporate changes in pore size and distribution, cracking of the microvoided layer, and introduction and cracking of an additional REMS topcoat to the system. The model can be used to generate a reasonable prediction of the time required to fully microvoid a REDS EBC layer on a CMC component in the hot gas path of an aircraft engine or stationary gas turbine.

We find that macroeconomic releases reduce uncertainty in commodity markets consistent with the hypothesis of uncertainty resolution following scheduled news announcements, while macroeconomic releases from the category of survey news announcements increase it. This result can be explained by the qualitative nature of these surveys and their ability to provide information in advance of major official macroeconomic indicators. Nevertheless, we show that survey news announcements can also be useful in resolving commodity market uncertainty in periods of heightened global financial turmoil and when the manufacturing sector of the largest economies is in contraction.

The bacterium Bacillus cereus occurs ubiquitously in the environment with certain strain backgrounds causing foodborne and opportunistic infections in humans. The emetic lineage of B. cereus is capable of producing the toxin cereulide, which evokes emetic illnesses. Although food products favouring the accumulation of cereulide are known, the ecological role of cereulide and the environmental niche of emetic B. cereus remain elusive. To better understand the ecology of cereulide-producing B. cereus, we systematically assayed the toxicological spectrum of cereulide on a variety of organisms belonging to different kingdoms. As cereulide is a potassium ionophore, we further tested the effect of environmental potassium levels on the action of cereulide. We found that adverse effects of cereulide exposure are species-specific, which can be exacerbated with increased environmental potassium. Additionally, we demonstrate that cereulide is produced within an insect cadaver indicating its potential ecological function for a saprophytic lifestyle. Collectively, distinct cereulide susceptibilities of other organisms may reflect its role in enabling competitive niche specialization of emetic B. cereus.

Therefore, ferroptosis inhibition represents an attractive strategy for COPD therapy. Herein, we identified natural flavonoid scutellarein as a potent ferroptosis inhibitor for the first time, and characterized its underlying mechanisms for inhibition of ferroptosis and COPD. In vitro, the anti-ferroptotic activity of scutellarein was investigated through CCK8, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blotting, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). In vivo, COPD was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/cigarette smoke (CS) and assessed by changes in histopathological, inflammatory, and ferroptotic markers. The mechanisms were investigated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS), local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and molecular dynamics. Our results showed that scutellarein significantly inhibited Ras-selective lethal small molecule (RSL)-3-induced ferroptosis and mitochondria injury in BEAS-2B cells, and ameliorated LPS/CS-induced COPD in mice. Furthermore, scutellarein also repressed RSL-3- or LPS/CS-induced lipid peroxidation, GPX4 down-regulation, and overactivation of Nrf2/HO-1 and JNK/p38 pathways. Mechanistically, scutellarein inhibited RSL-3- or LPS/CS-induced Fe2+ elevation through directly chelating Fe2+. Moreover, scutellarein bound to the lipid peroxidizing enzyme arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15), which resulted in an unstable state of the catalysis-related Fe2+ chelating cluster. Additionally, ALOX15 overexpression partially abolished scutellarein-mediated anti-ferroptotic activity. Our findings revealed that scutellarein alleviated COPD by inhibiting ferroptosis via directly chelating Fe2+ and interacting with ALOX15, and also highlighted scutellarein as a candidate for the treatment of COPD and other ferroptosis-related diseases.

However, in previous deep learning models for epidemic forecasting, spatial and temporal variations are captured separately. A unified model is developed to cover all spatio-temporal relations. However, this measure is insufficient for modelling the complex spatio-temporal relations of infectious disease transmission. A dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph network (DASTGN) is proposed based on attention mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy. In DASTGN, complex spatio-temporal relations are depicted by adaptively fusing the mixed space-time effects and dynamic space-time dependency structure. This dual-scale model considers the time-specific, space-specific, and direct effects of the propagation process at the fine-grained level. Furthermore, the model characterises impacts from various space-time neighbour blocks under time-varying interventions at the coarse-grained level. The performance comparisons on the three COVID-19 datasets reveal that DASTGN achieves state-of-the-art results with a maximum improvement of 17.092% in the root mean-square error and 11.563% in the mean absolute error. Experimental results indicate that the mechanisms of designing DASTGN can effectively detect some spreading characteristics of COVID-19. The spatio-temporal weight matrices learned in each proposed module reveal diffusion patterns in various scenarios. In conclusion, DASTGN has successfully captured the dynamic spatio-temporal variations of COVID-19, and considering multiple dynamic space-time relationships is essential in epidemic forecasting.

The existence of a Conformal Killing Vectors (CKV) and Bardeen's model to find the boundary conditions as an exterior space-time geometry to achieve the metric potentials for current study is used. Moreover, matching conditions have been employed to obtain a set of free parameters for the physical analysis. Furthermore, some physically valid attributes like the behavior of energy density, pressure, equilibrium conditions, the adiabatic index, mass-radius relation, surface red-shifts, and compactness factor for the realistic stars such as PSR J1614 - 2230, PSR J1903 + 327, SMC X - 1, Cen X - 3, LMC X - 4 and EXO 1785 - 248 are investigated. It is observed that for the current investigation, the derived compact star solutions are physically acceptable and authentic in the presence of charge with conformal motion.

However, only a few ICD inducers are currently available and many of them take effect based on traditional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress rather than mitochondrial stress. Besides, mitochondrion is closely related to ER and drug delivery via mitochondrial targeting usually shows a higher efficiency and cytotoxicity than that via ER targeting, which inspires to explore the ICD effect of cancer cells through mitochondrial stress. Herein, a mito-missile that can realize not only mitochondria-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT)/mild-temperature photothermal therapy (MTPTT) but also ICD-induced cancer immunotherapy is constructed. The mito-missile (termed DIH) is prepared by coating dc-IR825 (a mitochondrion-targeting cyanine dye)-loaded polyamidoamine dendrimer with hyaluronic acid. dc-IR825 can precisely target mitochondria and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mild heat upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, inducing mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial stress-caused enhanced ICD. By combining PDT, MTPTT, and ICD-induced immunotherapy, the DIH mito-missile can efficiently inhibit tumor growth and even eradicate tumors. This study develops a dendrimer-based nanoplatform for realizing mitochondrion-acting PDT/MTPTT as well as mitochondrial stress-induced potentiated ICD, which may provide a guideline for designing effective ICD inducers in the future.

J	Ahn, SS; Park, YB; Lee, SW				Ahn, Sung Soo; Park, Yong-Beom; Lee, Sang-Won			Association between computed tomography-assessed sarcopenia and mortality in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article						antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; computed tomography; prognosis; sarcopenia; vasculitis	SKELETAL-MUSCLE; CONSENSUS	Aim: Sarcopenia is frequently observed in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases; however, its relationship with patient outcomes has not been well understood. This study evaluated the influence of sarcopenia, especially muscle quality, on outcomes of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). Methods: Records of patients with AAV at the Severance Hospital with computed tomography (CT) images taken at initial disease diagnosis were retrospectively reviewed. For measures of sarcopenia, normal attenuation muscle area (NAMA), low attenuation muscle area (LAMA), intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and total abdominal muscle area (TAMA) in the axial muscles of the middle third lumbar vertebra level were calculated. Correlations between NAMA, LAMA, IMAT, and baseline patient characteristics, as well as the association between the NAMA/TAMA ratio and clinical outcomes were assessed. Results: A total of 136 patients with CT images at AAV diagnosis were identified. Correlation analyses revealed that age, female sex, total cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase were significantly associated with NAMA. LAMA was associated with age, body mass index (BMI), five-factor score (FFS), and C-reactive protein, and a relationship between IMAT and age and BMI was observed. During the follow up of 31.2 months, 23 (16.9%) patients died, and Cox-proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that a NAMA/TAMA <= 0.46 (odds ratio [OR] 10.247, p <.001), female sex (OR 0.206, p =.006), dyslipidemia (OR 3.143, p =.027), creatinine (OR 1.342, p =.012), and FFS (OR 1.775, p =.046), were independently associated with patient mortality. Conclusion: A higher rate of mortality was observed in patients with AAV with NAMA/TAMA <= 0.46, indicating that careful monitoring is required in these patients.

Study DesignCross-sectional diagnostic study SettingTertiary care voice clinic MethodsDigital stroboscopic videos, demographic and clinical data were collected from patients evaluated for a structural laryngeal lesion. Laryngoscopic images were extracted from videos and manually labeled with bounding boxes encompassing the lesion. Four detection models were employed to simultaneously localize and classify structural laryngeal lesions in laryngoscopic images. Classification accuracy, intersection over union (IoU) and mean average precision (mAP) were evaluated as measures of classification, localization, and overall performance, respectively. ResultsIn total, 8,172 images from 147 patients were included in the laryngeal image dataset. Classification accuracy was 88.5 for individual laryngeal images and increased to 92.0 when all images belonging to the same sequence (video) were considered. Mean average precision across all four detection models was 50.1 using an IoU threshold of 0.5 to determine successful localization. ConclusionResults of this study showed that deep neural network-based detection models trained using a labeled dataset of digital laryngeal images have the potential to classify structural laryngeal lesions as benign or suspicious for malignancy and to localize them within an image. This approach provides valuable insight into which part of the image was used by the model to determine a diagnosis, allowing clinicians to independently evaluate models' predictions.

Nonlinearity of healing: Healing narratives of Filipino therapists-in-training who self-identify as wounded healers	COUNSELLING & PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						counsellor education and development; counsellors-in-training; healing narratives; narrative identity; therapist-in-training; wounded healers	EXPERIENCES	Due to the stigma therapists-in-training face within the field owing to their woundedness, and the dearth of psychological literature on the healing of wounded healers (WHs), this study examined the healing journeys of nine Filipino therapists-in-training who self-identify as WHs. Narrative Identity framework was utilized to analyse the healing narratives gathered from nine semi-structured interviews with therapists-in-training. Results focussed on the healing narratives and how these shaped the identity and development of these future practitioners. The healing narratives of therapists-in-training were generally composed of four chapters: (a) identifying the wounded-client identity and its wounds, (b) entering the counselling field brings the emergence of the healer-therapist identity, (c) nonlinearity of healing transforms into a fluid WH, and (d) continuing the healing journey. These never-ending and nonlinear journeys shaped how therapists-in-training perceived and constructed or deconstructed their identification, with their dual identities influencing their practice. Additionally, their healing journeys contributed to their development as therapists who continue to heal from their woundedness. This study contributes to the literature regarding therapists-in-training who self-identify as WHs through the emphasised healing process. Moreover, this study may both lessen the stigma surrounding therapists-in-training's woundedness and help colleagues, educators, mentors and supervisors within the counselling field to better help trainees through the creation of open spaces, classes and training programmes that may help in enhancing their well-being and utilising their woundedness to increase, rather than impair, their therapeutic ability.

The formation of new ecotypes, some of which capable of coexisting for long periods of time, is highly likely in our guts. Horizontal gene transfer driven by temperate phages that can perform lysogeny is also widespread in mammalian intestines. Yet, the roles of mutation and especially lysogeny as key drivers of gut bacterial adaptation remain poorly understood. The mammalian gut contains hundreds of bacterial species, each with many strains and ecotypes, whose abundance varies along the lifetime of a host. A continuous high input of mutations and horizontal gene transfer events mediated by temperate phages drives that diversity. Future experiments to study the interaction between mutations that cause adaptation in microbiomes and lysogenic events with different costs and benefits will be key to understand the dynamic microbiomes of mammals.

J	Guenthner, C; Stimm, J; Kozerke, S				Guenthner, Christian; Stimm, Johanna; Kozerke, Sebastian			Analysis of temporal encoding efficiency of MR fingerprinting sequences	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						artifacts; encoding efficiency; MR fingerprinting; relaxometry	ALGORITHM; DESIGN	Purpose: MR Fingerprinting (MRF) relies on highly-undersampled images to simultaneously estimate multiple tissue parameters of interest. While a good understanding of the encoding principle behind MRF exists, we want to shed light on the question of when parameters are encoded during an MRF acquisition. Theory and Methods: We analyze the importance of each time point by leaving it out during matching (leave-one-out, LOO) assuming linear reconstruction is applied and study its influence on the reconstructed parameter map. To accelerate the analysis, we treat LOO as a small perturbation (LOOP) to the full matching problem and derive an analytical formula by leveraging Stolk and Sbrizzi's analysis on the interplay of k-space sampling and transient state dynamics. To study the influence of geometry and parameter distribution, we deploy LOOP on randomly sliced 3D brain geometries with randomized T1/T2 values to identify primary encoding regions independent of geometry. Results: LOOP can be evaluated orders of magnitude faster than conventional matching and visualizes temporal encoding efficiency. We use the findings to accelerate an MRF sequence by truncation as well as to remove undersampling artifacts through an iterative omission scheme in an ill-working MRF sequence in both in-silico and in-vivo experiments. Conclusion: LOOP is an analytical approach to quantify and visualize parameter encoding in MRF.

The investigations show a significant change in the forming behavior of the hcp materials as a result of superimposed electric current impulses. This behavior could be attributed to two effects. On the one hand, additional dislocation types are activated; on the other hand, new characteristic twin bands are formed. This is shown for all three hcp materials under investigation: Ti, Mg, and Zn. Furthermore, the hypothesis of the existence of a critical value of the current density at which a significant change in the plastic behavior occurs is verified by the experiments. The magnitude of this critical value for the analyzed hcp materials corresponds approximately to the theoretical values reported to be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 kA mm(-2). In addition to the current density, the duration of the pulses also has an influence on the EPE. Understanding the correlation between the individual activated deformation mechanisms during electric pulse treatment can be crucial for controlling the electroplastic forming processes in a systematic and targeted manner.

Treatment of a naphthalene complex with N-2 gave an end-on bridging dinitrogen complex featuring a [Ti2K2N2] core. The dinitrogen complex underwent insertion of CO2 into each Ti-NN bond to afford an N,N & PRIME;-dicarboxylated hydrazido complex. Stepwise nitrogen-carbon bond formation at coordinated N-2 proceeded to afford an unsymmetric hydrazido complex upon sequentially treating the dinitrogen complex with CS2 and CO2. Addition of Me3SiCl to the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex resulted in partial silylation of the carboxylate groups but did not lead to removal of the functionalized N-2 unit from the metal centers. However, reduction of the dicarboxylated hydrazido complex with potassium naphthalenide afforded an oxo-bridged dinuclear complex along with release of free potassium cyanate.

A meaningful fraction of these transformations proceeds through transiently generated enolate intermediates, which display quite versatile reactivity against a variety of electrophiles. Some years ago, our group became interested in developing BB-catalyzed asymmetric reactions of enolizable carbonyl substrates that involve & pi;-extended enolates in which, besides control of reaction diastereo and enantioselectivity, the site-selectivity control is an additional issue in most cases. In the examples covered in this account the opportunities deployed, and the challenges posed, by these methods are illustrated, with a focus on the generation of quaternary carbon stereocenters. In the way, new bifunctional BB catalysts as well as achiral templates were developed that may find further applications.

J	Tong, Q; Ling, YJ				Tong, Qin; Ling, Yingjie			A prognostic model based on regulatory T-cell-related genes in gastric cancer: Systematic construction and validation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						gastric cancer; GSEA; LASSO-Cox regression; prognosis; Treg	EXPRESSION; PROTEIN	Human gastrointestinal tumours have been shown to contain massive numbers of tumour infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs), the presence of which are closely related to tumour immunity. This study was designed to develop new Treg-related prognostic biomarkers to monitor the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer (GC). Treg-related prognostic genes were screened from Treg-related differentially expressed genes in GC patients by using Cox regression analysis, based on which a prognostic model was constructed. Then, combined with RiskScore, survival curve, survival status assessment and ROC analysis, these genes were used to verify the accuracy of the model, whose independent prognostic ability was also evaluated. Six Treg-related prognostic genes (CHRDL1, APOC3, NPTX1, TREML4, MCEMP1, GH2) in GC were identified, and a 6-gene Treg-related prognostic model was constructed. Survival analysis revealed that patients had a higher survival rate in the low-risk group. Combining clinicopathological features, we performed univariate and multivariate regression analyses, with results establishing that the RiskScore was an independent prognostic factor. Predicted 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of GC patients had a good fit with the actual survival rates according to nomogram results. In addition patients in the low-risk group had higher tumour mutational burden (TMB) values. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that genes in the high-risk group were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune inflammation, tumour proliferation and migration. In general, we constructed a 6-gene Treg-associated GC prognostic model with good prediction accuracy, where RiskScore could act as an independent prognostic factor. This model is expected to provide a reference for clinicians to estimate the prognosis of GC patients.

However, the defect states in the CBD-resulted SnO2 ETLs limit the electron extraction/transport from the perovskite to the ETL and lead to poor PSC performance. Herein, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dipotassium (EDTA-2K) is used as an additive in the CBD precursor of the SnO2 ETL, which results in the chelation of Sn2+ and EDTA during the hydrolysis process. This strategy decreases the concentration of free Sn2+ in the precursor for hydrolysis and slows down the CBD process, thus attributes to the decreased surface defect states as well as the enhanced conductivity of the ETL. As a result, the EDTA-2K additive makes the CBD SnO2 ETL with efficient electron extraction and transporting capability. The champion device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.87%, which is significantly higher than that of the pristine CBD SnO2-based device (20.25%). In addition, the device with an active area of 1.21 cm(2) achieves a high PCE of 19.23%. This strategy makes the CBD SnO2 an excellent ETL candidate for the development of low-cost and large-scale PSCs.

As it is accessible and economical, the exploitation of electrolyte additives is one of the most promising strategies to stabilize the Zn electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, the penta-potassium triphosphate (KTPP) as a novel trifunctional electrolyte additive is introduced to tune the electrode/electrolyte interface. First, the KTPP additive can induce an ion-conducting and mechanically robust solid electrolyte interphase film to stabilize the Zn anode. Second, the KTPP can complex with Zn2+ ions to reconstitute the dissolution sheath structure of the Zn2+ ion. Finally, the K+ cations in KTPP adsorb on the tips of the Zn anode surface as a shielding film to regulate Zn2+ ion flux. As a result, Zn//Zn symmetric cells can achieve significantly prolonged cycling stability (e.g., from 1077 to 3800 h at 1 mA cm(-2)/1 mAh cm(-2), from 256 to 2500 h at 2 mA cm(-2)/2 mAh cm(-2)), and ultrahigh cumulative capacity of 6400/7200 mAh cm(-2) at high current density (40/20 mA cm(-2)). A four-layer Zn-MnO2 pouch full cell with a high capacity of 9 mAh can be constructed, showing impressive practical application potential.

J	Almazroea, A				Almazroea, Abdulhadi			Homozygous LOXL2 variant in individuals affected by non-syndromic occipital encephalocele	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH			English	Article						exome sequencing; gene; LOXL2; occipital encephalocele; variants	OXIDASE-LIKE 3; LYSYL	Background: Occipital encephaloceles is a rare congenital defect in which meninges and the brain protrude out as a sac-like structure through opening in the skull. The condition can result in neurologic complications as well as structural abnormalities of the skull. To the best of our knowledge, no genetic variant has been identified as an underlying cause of non-syndromic occipital encephaloceles. Methods: In this study, I report a family with 2 individuals having large occipital encephalocele. Clinical and radiological examination did not reveal any other neurological or skeletal manifestations in both affected individuals. Results: Exome sequencing detected the previously unreported homozygous single nucleotide duplication (NM_002318.3:c.64dupC) in LOXL2 gene. This is a nonsense variant (NP_002309.1:p.Leu22Profs*7) leading to a premature truncation and loss-of-function of the lysyl oxidase-like 2 protein. The variant is segregating in an autosomal recessive manner in a family. Both parents are heterozygous carriers for the variant while unaffected sibs have wild type sequence. Conclusion: We hypothesize that LOXL2 is a potential candidate gene for occipital encephalocele due to the established role of LOXL3, a close paralog of LOXL2, in craniofacial development. This case illustrates the power of exome sequencing to establish genetic diagnosis and expands the spectrum of genetic defects in occipital encephalocele and related disorders.

Invoking cousin fixed effects models that adjust for unobserved legacies of disadvantage that cascade across generations, we find that families where both mothers and their children are exposed to childhood neighborhood disadvantage yield reduced earnings, net of observed and unobserved confounders, for all groups except for Blacks. We theorize that discrimination and racism salient for Blacks in the labor market may dim the ability of neighborhood attainment to act as a main pathway to social and economic mobility. These results push scholars to conceptualize neighborhoods as much more durable features of inequality and refine our understanding of the uneven economic returns to neighborhood attainment across race and ethnicity.

These nanogels are proposed as an alternative to the less stable paramagnetic nanogels obtained by electrostatic interactions between the polymeric matrix and paramagnetic Gd(III) chelates. The present novel nanogels show: i) relaxivity values seven times higher than that of typical monohydrated Mn(II) chelates at the clinical fields, thanks to the combination of a restricted mobility of the complex with a fast exchange of the metal-bound water molecule; ii) high stability of the formulation over time at pH 5 and under physiological conditions, thus excluding metal leaking or particles aggregation; iii) good extravasation and accumulation, with a maximum contrast achieved at 24 h post-injection in mice bearing subcutaneous breast cancer tumor; iv) high T-1 contrast (1 T) in the tumor 24 h post-injection. These improved properties pave the way for the use of these paramagnetic nanogels as promising magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes for in vitro and in vivo preclinical applications.

It has no specific symptoms and is difficult to be diagnosed early in the emergency department. Ultrasound is commonly used to detect PLA lesions of PLA, but its sensitivity can be affected by lesion size, location, and clinician experience. Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt treatment (especially abscess drainage) are crucial for better patient outcomes and should be prioritized by clinical physicians. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study to compare the effect of early and late (i.e., receiving CT scanning within 48 h and >48 h after admission) adoption of nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning regarding the hospitalization days and interval between admission and drainage of patients with PLA. ResultsThis study included 76 hospitalized patients with PLA in the Department of Digestive Disease of Xiamen Chang Gung Hospital in China who underwent CT examinations from 2014 to 2021. We conducted CT scans on 56 patients within 48 h of admission and on 20 patients more than 48 h after admission. The early CT group had a significantly shorter hospitalization length compared with the late CT group (15.0 days vs. 20.5 days; P = 0.035). Besides, the median time to initiate drainage after admission was also significantly shorter in the early CT group than in the late CT group (1.0 days vs. 4.5 days; P < 0.001). ConclusionEarly CT scanning within 48 h of admission may aid in early PLA diagnosis and benefit disease recovery, as revealed by our findings.

A viable alternative is the use of coatings that are compatible with the surface of food and safe for consumption, which restricts the exchange of water vapor between the material and the environment. Coatings from waxy starch cryogels are an alternative little studied and with great potential for use in crackers. The coating prevents the cookies from absorbing approximately 50% less water from the environment when stored under controlled conditions, directly reflecting on their mechanical properties. Likewise, it is verified through the micrographs obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy that the surface of the crackers is modified with the addition of cryogel. Regarding the analysis by Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflection spectroscopy and thermal by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry, it is observed that the coating modified interactions at the molecular level in terms of the vibrations of the main functional groups and their thermal behavior in terms of heat flow, heat capacity, and evaporation enthalpies. It is found that the coating works as an excellent barrier to water vapor after 21 days of storage.

Improving chitosan properties through ionic and chemical cross-linking and their impact on emulsified systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Antimicrobials; emulsion; genipin; lipid oxidation; TPP	IONOTROPIC GELATION; NANOPARTICLES; EMULSIONS	Chitosan (CS) nanoparticles were formed by two different methodologies: ionic (with sodium tripolyphosphate -TPP) and chemical (with genipin -GN) cross-linking. CS-TPP and CS-GN nanoparticles showed positive zeta potential (+46.24 and +62.86 mV, respectively) and sizes ranging from 83.70 to 835.91 nm, respectively. Ionic cross-linking (with TPP) resulted in particles smaller than those formed by chemical cross-linking (with GN). The in vitro antibacterial activity revealed an efficient inhibitory effect, especially regarding CS-TPP. In situ, antibacterial and antioxidant studies were carried out on O/W emulsions. The mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts, peroxide value and quantification of conjugated dienes and trienes during time revealed that nanoparticles tend to improve the microbiological and oxidative stability of emulsions. These findings underline the direct relationship between the reduction of particle size and the increase in biopolymer functional properties and expand the possibilities of CS application as a natural preservative of emulsified systems.

However, a decrease in the number of operating thermal generators, the main source of balancing power in the Japanese balancing market, is causing concerns regarding a shortage of balancing power in the future. PV can therefore provide balancing power in addition to energy; thus, the PV power economic value in electricity markets will become diversified. A solution examination and rationality analysis of technical issues for PV-based balancing power creation are needed. Here, by applying the proposed headroom control method based on the PV output curtailment beforehand, PV generator optimizes benefit by bidding into the balancing market when the spot market price is very low. Optimizing the bidding strategy on the spot market and balancing market is conducted, and battery integration is also considered. The optimization simulation results validate the possibility of creating balancing power by a PV power producer, and the total revenue valuation verifies a more beneficial effect.

Exploring the luminescence of tin-incorporated nickel-sensitized lithium gallate short-wave-infrared phosphors	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article						gallates; nanocrystals; nickel(II); persistent luminescence; tin(IV)	PERSISTENT LUMINESCENCE; LIGA5O8; NI2+; CR3+	A series of Ni2+-sensitized LiGa5O8 nanocrystals doped with varying amounts of Sn4+ were synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state method. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were employed to investigate the microstructure of the LiGa5O8 host, and optical spectroscopy was used to examine the effects of Sn4+ addition on the emission spectra and persistent luminescence (PersL) properties, which indicated a homogeneous distribution of the constituent elements in the phosphor. The Sn4+ incorporation led to an approximately sixfold enhancement of photoluminescence intensity at room temperature and decrease in the energy transition of Ni2+(T-3(2)(F-3)& RARR;(3)A(2)(F-3)), which resulted in & SIM;65 nm bathochromic shift in the photoluminescence emission maxima. However, the addition of Sn4+ dopant led to a decrease in the quantum yield of luminescence compared to that of the original phosphor. Temperature-dependent thermoluminescence measurements revealed that doping of LiGa5O8 with Sn4+ interfered with the Ni2+ trap centers. Moreover, Ni2+-sensitized Sn4+-doped LiGa5O8 nanocrystals exhibited an afterglow effect that persisted for up to 300 s.

Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and safety.Results: Patients with ICI-chemo (median PFS [mPFS], 6.3 months; HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.88; p = 0.008; median OS [mOS], 10.7 months; HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.94; p = 0.026), ICI-target (7.2 months; HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36-0.80; p = 0.002; 15.8 months; HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.84; p = 0.006) or ICI-target-chemo (6.9 months; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.90; p = 0.009; 14.4 months; HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31-0.70; p < 0.001) achieved better clinical outcomes than those with Chemo (3.8 months; 9.3 months). ICI-target was not inferior to ICI-chemo in survival outcomes (HR for PFS: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.55-1.42; p = 0.614; HR for OS: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.51-1.55; p = 0.680). ICI-target-chemo yielded similar prognoses as ICI-chemo (HR for PFS: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.70-1.62; p = 0.764; HR for OS: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.45-1.31; p = 0.328) and ICI-target (HR for PFS: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.77-1.88; p = 0.413; HR for OS: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.51-1.47; p = 0.583) but resulted in more adverse events (p < 0.001; p = 0.010). Multivariable and propensity score analyses supported these findings.Conclusions: Among patients with uICC, ICI-chemo or ICI-target provided more survival benefits than Chemo while achieving comparable prognoses and fewer adverse events than ICI-target-chemo.

Firstly, backstepping technique is used to design controller due to the mismatched disturbances. Secondly, the periodic component of the lumped disturbances is estimated by ILC method, while the aperiodic component is attenuated by switching term with adaptive gain. In addition, a time-varying boundary layer approach is employed to overcome the identical initial condition limitation of the ILC. Through a proper composite energy function, the convergence of the closed-loop system is analyzed. Finally, simulation and experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The diatomite-PW/PP composites were prepared using the melt extrusion method, replacing different proportions of PW with diatomite, and subsequently evaluated for their properties. The results indicate that adding diatomite enhances the density while reducing the brightness and water absorption of the composites. Scanning electron microscopy, analysis reveals a uniform distribution of diatomite in the range of 5-10 wt%, which effectively serves as a filler and reinforcing agent, consequently improving the toughness of the composite system. Specifically, the impact strength, tensile strength, and elongation at break are enhanced by 25.9%, 9.5%, and 35.7%, respectively. Furthermore, creep rheological analysis demonstrates improved processability and creep resistance in the composite system.

Portal vein tumour thrombus (PVTT) is considered one of most fearful complications of HCC and is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying the formation and development of PVTT is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies for HCC patients. Several studies have been made to uncover that tumour microenvironment, stem cells, abnormal gene expression and non-coding RNAs deregulation are associated with PVTT in patients with HCC in the last decade. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of PVTT in patients with HCC are still largely unknown. In the present review, we briefly summarized the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and development of PVTT in HCC.

In this article, we used the 16S rRNA V3-V4 hypervariable areas of bacteria to assess the microbial community and metabolic function of Scomber japonicus during storage at 4 & DEG;C for 9 days. The physicochemical and microbiological indices including total viable counts (TVC), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and biogenic amines (BAs) were determined. Observations revealed that TVC, TVB-N and BAs content dramatically increased over the storage, TVB-N, histamine, cadaverine and tyramine content reached 54.18 mg/100 g, 621.26, 190.93 and 57.48 mg kg(-1), respectively, at the end of storage. The decrease of alpha diversity indicated the decrease of microbial community plenty and diversity. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Moraxellaceae unclassified occupied the dominant position during storage. The accumulation of histamine and cadaverine correlated positively with Pseudomonas and Brochothrix while negatively with Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter and Flavobacterium. Putrescine production and Photobacterium showed a strong favourable association. Amino acid metabolism and glucose metabolism were the two primary metabolic routes during the storage of S. japonicus, according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Overall, this study explored the interrelationships among the microbial community, functional metabolisms and spoilage characteristics during the storage of S. japonicus, which aimed to identify the specific spoilage organisms and help to deepen the understanding of roles that this microbiota played during spoilage.

Adult patients with clinically severe obesity attending a hospital-based obesity service in Greater Western Sydney were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey that collected data on dental utilization and visiting patterns, dental anxiety, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). General health data were obtained from participants' medical records. Of the 82 individuals who consented to participate, 81 (98.8%) completed the study questionnaire, and 74 (91.3%) answered additional screening questions related to their general wellbeing and mental health. Of the participants, 50 (61.7%) reported that their last dental visit was more than 1 year ago, 43 (53.1%) visited only as needed and 22 (27.2%) participants reported favourable dental visiting patterns. Twenty-four (29.6%) participants reported high levels of dental anxiety, and low levels of OHRQoL compared with national data. Screening questions suggested low general wellbeing and poor mental health in this patient cohort. Within this group, BMI was not significantly correlated with any of the variables of dental service utilization, dental anxiety, OHRQoL, wellbeing, or mental health (p > .05). There was a negative correlation between dental anxiety and dental utilization (p < .05). Patients with clinically severe obesity reported poor dental utilization, low OHRQoL, and high levels of dental anxiety. This study highlighted the frequency of medical complications, lack of wellbeing, and poor mental health, which were evident in this cohort and may complicate dental management.

These products are usually designed to have physicochemical properties, sensory attributes, and functional behaviors that match those of the animal-sourced products they are designed to replace. However, there has been concern about the potential negative impacts of these foods on human nutrition and health. In particular, many of these products have been criticized for being ultraprocessed foods that contain numerous ingredients and are manufactured using harsh processing operations. In this article, the concept of ultraprocessed foods is introduced and its relevance to describe the properties of next-generation plant-based foods is discussed. Most commercial plant-based meat, seafood, egg, and dairy analogs currently available do fall into this category, and so can be classified as ultraprocessed plant-based (UPB) foods. The nutrient content, digestibility, bioavailability, and gut microbiome effects of UPB foods are compared to those of animal-based foods, and the potential consequences of any differences on human health are discussed. Some commercial UPB foods would not be considered healthy based on their nutrient profiles, especially those plant-based cheeses that contain low levels of protein and high levels of fat, starch, and salt. However, it is argued that UPB foods can be designed to have good nutritional profiles and beneficial health effects. Finally, areas where further research are still needed to create a more healthy and sustainable food supply are discussed.

High performance biopolymer blend nanocomposites derived from cashew gum/polyvinyl alcohol/boehmite for flexible electronic devices	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						biopolymers and renewable polymers; blends; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); mechanical properties; thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)	POLYMER; BOEHMITE	This work reports on a bio-based polymer blend comprised of polyvinyl alcohol/cashew gum (PVA/CG) embedded with boehmite nanoparticles to tailor the structural, thermal, mechanical properties, and electrical response. The chemical bonding between boehmite and the PVA/CG blend was confirmed by FTIR. The XRD data showed that the nanocomposite films had distinct peaks of boehmite. The SEM images revealed uniformly dispersed morphology at 5 wt% boehmite. The elemental composition of blend nanocomposites was revealed by the EDX analysis. The thermal stability of the blend increases with increasing boehmite, whereas the glass transition temperature decreases. The highest AC conductivity was achieved for PVA/CG/7 wt% boehmite, which was 4.6 times greater than the pure blend. The frequency and temperature-dependent dielectric constant, modulus and impedance of all films were examined in conjunction with different nanoparticle loadings. Tensile strength and hardness have improved with the addition of boehmite into the PVA/CG blend whereas the elongation at break slightly decreases. The PVA/CG blend had a tensile strength of 31.17 MPa, which increased to 44.66 MPa when 7 wt% boehmite was added. Therefore, eco-friendly PVA/CG/boehmite films with good thermal stability, mechanical strength, dielectric constant, and conductivity could be a practical green substitute for flexible electronic, charge storage, and electrochemical devices.

The feasibility of a 6-month dietary intervention aiming to increase protein intake among community-dwelling older adults with low habitual protein intake: A secondary analysis of the PROMISS randomised controlled trial	JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS			English	Article; Early Access						community-dwelling; dietary intervention; feasibility; older adults; protein intake	RECOMMENDATIONS	BackgroundThe PROMISS randomised controlled trial showed that personalised dietary advice increased protein intake and improved 400-m walk time and leg strength among community-dwelling older adults with a low habitual protein intake. This secondary analysis describes and further evaluates the methods and feasibility of the model used to carry out dietary intervention in the PROMISS randomised controlled trial. MethodsIn total, 185 participants (& GE;65 years, 54% women) with a habitual low protein intake (<1.0 g/kg adjusted body weight/day) in Finland and the Netherlands received personalised dietary advice and complimentary protein-enriched food products for 6 months with two main objectives: (1) to increase protein intake to & GE;1.2 g/kg adjusted body weight/day (energy-neutral) and (2) to include each day a 'high-protein meal' containing & GE; 30-35 g of protein. The feasibility of the model was evaluated by the adoption of the advice, feedback from the participants, and practical experiences by the nutritionists. ResultsIn all, 174 participants (93.5%) completed the intervention. At the 6-month follow-up, 41.8% reached both main objectives of the advice. The participants' general rating for the dietary advice was 8.6 (SD 1.0) (on a scale of 1-10; 10 indicating very good). Sticking to the advice was (very) easy for 79.2% of the participants. The nutritionists perceived the model feasible for the participants except for those with low food intake. ConclusionsThe methods used in this model are mainly feasible, well-received and effective in increasing protein intake among community-dwelling older adults with low habitual protein intake.

Association between glomerular filtration rate and plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration in dogs	JOURNAL OF SMALL ANIMAL PRACTICE			English	Article							PROHORMONE; CLEARANCE; CIRCULATION; BIOMARKERS; FRAGMENT; INCREASE; IOHEXOL	Objectives: To investigate the association between plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and glomerular filtration rate in dogs.Materials and Methods: Dogs were classified into four categories by bodyweight. Dogs were divided into four groups (Groups 1 to 4) based on glomerular filtration rate estimates using plasma iohexol clearance per bodyweight category. Generalised linear models were built to explore the relationship between plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and glomerular filtration rate and the effect of confounders on plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration.Results: Fifty-three dogs were included (Group 1, 25; Group 2, seven; Group 3, five; and Group 4, 16). The medians (interquartile range) N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations for Groups 1 to 4 were 7224 pg/mL (4766 to 10,254 mg/dL), 8958 pg/mL (4935 to 11,271 mg/dL), 9280 pg/mL (9195 to 10,384 mg/dL) and 12,683 pg/mL (9133 to 19,217 mg/dL), respectively. Group 4, estimated to have the highest reduction in glomerular filtration rate, had a higher plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration than Groups 1 to 3. Based on the final generalised linear model, influencing factors for plasma N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration were plasma iohexol clearance (-0.136; 95% confidence interval, -0.227 to -0.046) and bodyweight (-0.058; 95% confidence interval, -0.098 to -0.018).Clinical Significance: N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide concentration is associated with the glomerular filtration rate.

Similarly, elevated Ge and Zn levels in Gale crater sedimentary bedrock indicate a magmatic source for these elements. To constrain the relative effects of Cl and S on the outgassing of these trace metals and chemical characteristics of primary magmatic vapor deposits incorporated to Martian surface, we conducted a set of degassing and fumarolic alteration experiments. Ge is found to be more volatile than Zn in all experiments. In S-bearing runs, the loss of Ge and Zn was less than any other experiments. In Cl-only runs, degassing of Zn was more than twice that of Ge within the first 10 min and percent loss increased for both elements with increasing time. In Cl + S runs, S-induced reduction of GeO2 and ZnO to metallic Ge and Zn switches the preference of chloride formation from Zn to Ge. Up to 90% of Ge and Zn loss in the 1-h no volatile-added (NVA) experiments might be due to the small amounts of Cl contamination in NVA mixes via other oxides used for synthesis. Alteration experiments show different phases between 1-h and 24-/72-h runs. In 1-h runs, anhydrite and langbeinite dominate while in 24-/72-h runs halite and sylvite dominate the condensate assemblages. S-bearing phases form as the intermediate products of fumarolic deposition, while chlorides are common when the system is allowed to cool gradually. One-hour exposure was sufficient to form alteration phases and vapor deposits such as NaCl, KCl, CaSO4, and langbeinites on the Martian analog minerals. These salts were identified in Martian meteorites and in situ measurements. Our results provide evidence that volcanic degassing along with fumarolic alteration could be a potential source for the enrichment and varying abundances of Cl, S, Fe, Zn, Ge in Martian surface, as well as a cause for Ge depletion in shergottites.

In this study, a magnetic carbon-based adsorbent, named magnetic nitrogen-doped carbon (M-NC), was developed for the selective removal of lead(II) (Pb(II)) from yellow rice wine. RESULTSThe results showed that the uniformly structured M-NC could be easily separated from the solution, exhibiting a high Pb(II) adsorption capacity of 121.86 mg g(-1). The proposed adsorption treatment showed significant Pb(II) removal efficiencies (91.42-98.90%) for yellow rice wines in 15 min without affecting their taste, odor, and physicochemical characteristics of the wines. The adsorption mechanism studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analyses indicated that the selective removal of Pb(II) could be attributed to the electrostatic interaction and covalent interaction between the empty orbital of Pb(II) and the & pi; electrons of the N species on M-NC. Additionally, the M-NC showed no significant cytotoxicity on the Caco-2 cell lines. CONCLUSIONSelective removal of Pb(II) from yellow rice wine was achieved using magnetic carbon-based adsorbent. This facile and recyclable adsorption operation could potentially address the challenge of toxic metal pollution in liquid foods. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Nivolumab and ipilimumab are immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, respectively. Owing to their complementary anticancer effects, nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy (N + I) has been studied and approved for treating malignant melanoma in various countries including Japan. Real-world postmarketing surveillance was implemented to record treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in patients treated with N + I following its approval in Japan. Patients were eligible for registration if they had unresectable malignant melanoma and started N + I between September 2018 and August 2019. The observation period was 13 weeks from starting N + I. Only safety information was collected and evaluated. The final case report form lock was March 2021. Overall, 173 patients (median age, 66.0 years; performance status 0-1, 88.4%; skin: 53.2%; mucosal: 32.4%) were eligible for the analyses. Overall, 34.1% of patients completed 4 doses of N + I. N + I was discontinued by 63.0% (due to adverse events in 67.9% and disease progression/death in 22.9%). Any grade and grade & GE;3 TRAEs were reported in 73.41% and 52.02%, respectively. TRAEs in & GE;10 patients were hepatic function abnormal (any grade/grade & GE;3: 23.12%/13.29%), pyrexia (10.40%/0.58%), diarrhea (9.25%/2.89%), rash (8.67%/0.58%), hypophysitis (5.78%/5.20%), interstitial lung disease (5.78%/2.89%), and liver disorder (5.78%/4.62%). TRAEs were classified as recovered (36.99% of patients), recovering (44.51%), unrecovered (13.29%), recovered with sequelae (2.31%), and death (1.73%). Overall, 24 of 34 patients (70.59%) with gastrointestinal-related and 53 of 65 (81.54%) liver-related TRAEs received treatment, such as a steroid with/without an immunosuppressant; most patients recovered within 1 to 2 months. In conclusion, this postmarketing surveillance of N + I in patients with unresectable malignant melanoma revealed no new safety concerns compared with results of prior studies. Immune-related TRAEs were generally manageable by appropriate treatment including a steroid.

However, their practical applications are severely impeded by large volume expansion, unstable solid-electrolyte interfaces (SEI), and sluggish reaction kinetics during cycling. Herein, a surface engineering of tin nanorods via N-doped carbon layers (Sn@NC) and an interface engineering strategy to improve the electrochemical performance in SIBs are reported. In particular, the authors demonstrate that uniform surface modification can effectively facilitate electron and sodium transport kinetics, confine alloy pulverization, and simultaneously synergize interactions with the ether-based electrolyte to form a robust organic-inorganic SEI. Moreover, it is discovered that the diethylene glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte with strong stability and an optimized Na+ solvation structure can co-embed the carbon layer to achieve fast reaction kinetics. Consequently, Sn@NC anodes deliver extra-long cycling stability of more than 10 000 cycles. The full cell of Na3V2(PO4)(3)Sn@NC exhibits high energy density (215 Wh kg(-1)), excellent high-rate capability (reaches 80% capacity in 2 min), and long cycle life over a wide temperature range of -20 to 50 & DEG;C.

This study aimed to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for screw loosening after iliosacral screw fixation for posterior pelvic ring injury. MethodsA total of 135 patients with posterior pelvic ring injuries who were treated with iliosacral screw fixation in our department between July 2015 and April 2021 were selected for this retrospective analysis. The possible risk factors for screw loosening were investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of patient demographics and trauma-related and iatrogenic variables, including age, sex, body mass index, Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA) index, mechanism of injury, Young-Burgess classification, site of injury, type of injury, type of screw, mode of fixation, numbers of guidewire adjustments, accuracy of screw position, and quality of fracture reduction. ResultsThe incidence of screw loosening was 15.6% (n = 21). The mean duration for screw loosening was 3.2 & PLUSMN; 1.5 months after operation. Univariate analysis results showed that the Young-Burgess classification, type of injury, site of injury, type of screw, mode of fixation, and OSTA index might be related to screw loosening (p < 0.05). According to the multivariate logistic regression, vertical shear injuries (Odds ratios [OR] 9.80, 95% Confidence intervals [CI] [1.96-73.28], p = 0.008), type of injury (OR 0.25, 95% CI [0.13-0.79], p = 0.027), common screws (OR 6.94, 95% CI [1.53-31.40], p = 0.012), screws insertion only at the level of the first sacral segment (S1) (OR 8.79, 95% CI [1.18-65.46], p = 0.034), injury site located in the medial sacral foramina (OR 6.28, 95% CI [1.16-34.06], p = 0.033), and lower OSTA index [OR 0.41, 95% CI [0.24-0.71], p = 0.001] were significantly related to screw loosening. ConclusionsVertical shear injuries, sacral fractures, injury site located in the medial sacral foramina, and lower OSTA index are significantly associated with the postoperative occurrence of screw loosening. Transiliac-transsacral screw fixation and screws insertion both at the level of the S1 and second sacral segment can prevent screw loosening.

Data were collected between July 2021 and December 2021. Delirium was assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). The Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (KATZ ADL) scale was used to measure ADL. ADL was assessed preoperatively and daily during the first five postoperative days. The STROBE checklist was used to report this study.Results: Results showed that 44 (16.2%) patients developed new episode of delirium. Postoperative delirium was independently associated with decline in ADL (RR = 2.83, 95% CI = 2.71-2.97; p < 0.001).Conclusions: Postoperative delirium was associated with a decline in ADL among older people during the first five postoperative days. Screening for delirium in the PACU is essential to identify delirium during the early stages of postoperative period and implement a timely comprehensive plan.Relevance to clinical practice: Delirium assessment of older patients in the PACU, and for at least the first five postoperative days, is strongly recommended. We also recommend engagement of patients in a focused physical and cognitive daily activity plan, particularly for older patients undergoing major surgery.Patient or public contribution: Patients and nurses helped in data collection at a tertiary care hospital.

The visible product of redox transformation of Fe is the sediment colour. Distinct red and black sediment layers have been studied in eight shallow (<4.2 m depth) sections in the floodplain of Morava River, Czechia. The aim was to investigate the composition, origin, rates of formation and stratigraphic significance of the red strata using bulk-rock analytical methods, radiocarbon dating, optical and scanning electron microscopy coupled with in situ (energy-dispersive X-ray scanning electron microscopy and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) geochemistry. The coloured layers, in places well-cemented, developed in permeable sands and gravels above the water table, close to the boundary with overlying less permeable floodplain sandy silts. Their colour is due to Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides (goethite, haematite, todorokite and birnessite) coatings of framework grains. Black, Mn-rich layers occur stratigraphically higher than the red, Fe-rich ones. The coatings are a few-hundred microns thick at maximum, often botryoidal, composed of alternating Fe-rich and Mn-rich laminae enriched in As, Mo, Sb, P, Cu and U. The coatings formed under suboxic conditions due to Fe and Mn oxyhydroxide cycling, driven partly by microbial activity, at the groundwater-related redox boundary which resulted in the distinct vertical arrangement of the black and red layers. Being markedly enriched in As bound to Fe-oxyhydroxides and exposed to fluctuating redox conditions, the coloured strata can potentially release As to groundwater and represent serious environmental hazards. Radiocarbon ages suggest that the groundwater-type red beds can occur extremely quickly, over a few hundred years. It is assumed that, under suitable circumstances, this reddening can be preserved in the rock record, and represent a specific model for the development of continental red beds.

Here, 2550EO containing varying amounts of amide salts (LiF(SO2CF3)(2) (LiTFSI)) was used as the main matrix. PVdF-HFP was used in concentrations of up to 30 % to increase the film-forming ability of 2550EO/LiTFSI, and a series of solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membranes were prepared. After incorporating the blended SPE with a minute amount of organic carbonates (only 15 wt%), the electrochemical features, such as Li+ conductivity and transference number (t(Li)(+)), significantly increased. For example, a t(Li)(+) of 0.42 and ionic conductivities of 0.64 and 0.3 S cm(-1) at 60 & DEG;C and 25 & DEG;C, respectively, were achieved. In addition, the electrochemical stability exceeded 5 and 4.8 V at 25 & DEG;C and 60 & DEG;C, respectively. Thus, a high Li/LiFePO4 battery performance with high coulombic efficiencies exceeding 96 % and 98 % at 60 & DEG;C and 25 & DEG;C were achieved at 0.1 C, respectively. This was due to the superiority of the polysiloxane structure over its organic counterpart, attributed to its highly flexible backbone, high segmental mobility, and outstanding thermal and chemical stability.

We aimed to explore alternative criteria using different numbers of measured LMs and thresholds of size and density variation. We retrospectively studied patients with advanced pancreatic or small intestine NETs with LMs, treated with systemic treatment in the first-and/or second-line, without early progression, in 14 European expert centers. We compared time to treatment failure (TTF) between responders and non-responders according to various criteria defined by 0%, 10%, 20% or 30% decrease in the sum of LM size, and/or by 10%, 15% or 20% decrease in LM density, measured on two, three or five LMs, on baseline (=1 month before treatment initiation) and first revaluation (=6 months) contrast-enhanced CT scans. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were performed to adjust the association between response criteria and TTF on prognostic factors. We included 129 systemic treatments (long-acting somatostatin analogs 41.9%, chemotherapy 26.4%, targeted therapies 31.8%), administered as first-line (53.5%) or second-line therapies (46.5%) in 91 patients. A decrease =10% in the size of three LMs was the response criterion that best predicted prolonged TTF, with significance at multivariable analysis (HR 1.90; 95% CI: 1.06-3.40; p = .03). Conversely, response defined by RECIST 1.1 did not predict prolonged TTF (p = .91), and neither did criteria based on changes in LM density. A =10% decrease in size of three LMs could be a more clinically relevant criterion than the current 30% threshold utilized by RECIST 1.1 for the evaluation of treatment efficacy in patients with advanced NETs. Its implementation in clinical trials is mandatory for prospective validation. Criteria based on changes in LM density were not predictive of treatment efficacy.Clinical Trial Registration: Registered at CNIL-CERB, Assistance publique hopitaux de Paris as "E-NETNET-L-E-CT" July 2018.

Currently, there is no data available on the canal shaping abilities of BlueShaper and DC Taper instruments. MethodologySixty-four single-rooted mandibular premolars were matched based on similar root canal morphologic features as determined by (micro-CT) and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental groups (n = 16) according to the instrument system used: BlueShaper, TruNatomy, DC Taper and HyFlex EDM One File. Changes in the root canal surface and volume, remaining dentine thickness, and number of prepared areas were assessed. ResultsNo significant differences were found amongst the four instrument systems for the parameters evaluated (p > .05). There was a significant reduction in the number of unprepared areas and the remaining dentine thickness after each increase in size of the instruments tested (p < .05). ConclusionsThe four instrument systems perform similarly in long oval root canals. Although none could prepare all canal walls, larger preparations incorporated significantly more surfaces in the final shape.

Using climate-related Google Trends and news, we construct five dimensions of the public climate attention index and media climate attention index. After feature selection, we incorporate the optimized combination with lagged order into the machine learning model to predict EU Emission Allowance futures returns. Our empirical results show that the forecasting models with climate attention outperform the corresponding benchmark models, indicating that climate attention does provide predictive information for carbon futures returns. In addition, we carry out trading simulations to investigate the economic performance of the forecast results. It turns out that the market strategies based on the prediction models with climate attention can deliver more benefits than the counterpart market strategies. More specifically, the cumulative returns reach 140% during the out-of-sample period, much higher than 79% of the cumulative returns of the buy-and-hold strategy.

J	Hou, YL				Hou, Yulin			Deep trade agreements and trade costs	WORLD ECONOMY			English	Article; Early Access						deep trade agreement; trade costs	INTERNATIONAL-TRADE	Deep trade agreements (DTAs) have boomed in recent years and extended their reach well beyond tariff liberalisation. This paper investigates the impact of deep trade agreements on trade costs from a global perspective. The results show that trade costs between partners that sign an agreement with the highest depth decrease by 10.3%. The results are shown to be robust to the consideration of interval data, different measures of the trade agreement depth, different datasets, and alternative estimation strategy. Furthermore, we provide supportive evidence of the spillover effect of DTAs. We find that non-discriminatory provisions in DTAs significantly lower non-tariff costs for non-member countries, especially for agricultural goods.

Refine control methodology and implementation of capacitor voltage control for improved switched inductor Z-source inverter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUIT THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Z-source inverter; switched inductor; boost factor; PI controller		Nowadays, Z-source inverter (ZSI) has received several attentions compared to other power converters owing to their simplicity and reliability. In this paper, a refine control methodology of capacitor voltage control is presented based on third-order small signal analysis. The proposed control is applied to the improved switched inductor ZSI (ISL-ZSI). Proportional, integral, and derivative controller (PID) is adopted due to their capability to operate with large operation levels, reliable operation, and cheaper implementation. In addition, the function of this control can be achieved even with incomplete system data or parameters variations. ISL-ZSI has been presented because of its advantages such as the high gain of direct current voltage, low voltage stress for both the Z-network and the inverter bridge switches, and ensuring good soft starting. In addition, the inrush current has been removed based on its configuration. The proposed control is validated by both experimental and simulation results under input voltage change, load change, and steady-state operations using DSP F28335 and MATLAB SIMULINK Real-Time Workspace.

Analysing How Swedish Judges' Motives for Action Vary in the Preliminary Ruling Procedure	JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES			English	Article; Early Access						CJEU; logic of appropriateness; logic of consequentialism; national judges; preliminary ruling procedure	EUROPEAN COURT; JUSTICE; EU; LOGICS; LAW	This article explores how national judges' reasoning in the preliminary ruling procedure varies depending on the prescriptive clarity of European Union (EU) legal frameworks. Drawing on the logic of appropriateness and the logic of expected consequences, this article formulates hypotheses regarding judges' motivational patterns. Interviews with Swedish judges generate findings that partly corroborate these hypotheses. The findings show that when EU legal frameworks are clear, judges express a mix of considerations, including references to EU rules, expected politico-strategic outcomes and professional norms. When the clarity of the frameworks is low, judges mainly motivate their decisions by invoking professional norms. In light of these findings, the article proposes a revision of the compliance pull explanation that takes into account how not only formal EU rules but also informal norms of appropriate professional conduct may influence the actions of national judges.

Under conditions of oxidative stress, the accumulation of cellular iron overload and lipid peroxidation can lead to ferroptosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), serving as mediators in the cell-to-cell communication, play an important role in regulating the outcome of cell ferroptosis. Growing evidence has proven that EV biogenesis and secretion are tightly associated with cellular iron export. Furthermore, different sources of EVs deliver diverse cargoes to bring about phenotypic changes in the recipient cells, either activating or inhibiting ferroptosis. Thus, delivering therapies targeting ferroptosis through EVs may hold significant potential for treating musculoskeletal diseases. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the role of EVs in iron homeostasis and ferroptosis, as well as their therapeutic applications in musculoskeletal diseases, and thereby provide valuable insights for both research and clinical practice.

Data were collected via face-to-face semi-structured interviews, based on open questions regarding acquisition behaviours for nutrition-related information and flexible question formulation, and the data were analysed using an inductive-deductive method. A health promotion model was used as a conceptual framework to regulate the refinement of themes.Results: Three themes were identified in this study. The first theme discussed the individual characteristics and experiences of older adults that contributed to their acquisition behaviours for nutrition-related information. The second theme described behaviour-specific cognitions of and the effects on the participants regarding the influencing factors involving various internal individual elements and external physical environment. The third theme explored the positive behavioural outcomes of the participants resulting from these acquisition behaviours.Conclusion: Acquisition behaviours for nutrition-related information of older adults in long-term care facilities were affected by both individual characteristics and external physical environment factors. Access to nutritional information can help older adults cultivate a healthy diet. Although they exhibited a significant interest in nutrition, the participants still encountered several difficulties. Based on the actual care needs of the older people, appropriate nutritional information interventions should be provided by healthcare providers working in long-term care facilities so as to improve the ability of the older people to acquire information independently.Patient or public contribution: All 16 participants actively participated in the interview process and the preliminary preparation of the article.

In this study, the structure vacancy defect modified diatomic-layered g-C3N4 nanosheet (VCN) is synthesized by thermal treatment of bulk g-C3N4 in a quartz tube with vacuum atmosphere that will generate a pressure-thermal dual driving force to boost the exfoliation and formation of structure vacancy for g-C3N4. The as-prepared VCN possesses a large specific surface area with a rich pore structure to provide more active centers for catalytic reactions. Furthermore, the as-formed special defect level in VCN sample can generate a higher exciton density at photoexcitation stage. Meanwhile, the photogenerated charges will rapidly transfer to VCN surface due to the greatly shortened transfer path resulting from the ultrathin structure (& AP;1.5 nm), which corresponds to two graphite carbon nitride atomic layers. In addition, the defect level alleviates the drawback of enlarged bandgap caused by the quantum size effect of nano-scaled g-C3N4, resulting in a well visible-light utilization. As a result, the VCN sample exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance both in hydrogen production and photodegradation of typical antibiotics.

Nitrogen transfer between plant species with different temporal N-demand	ECOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						gypsum outcrop; nutrient exchange; phenology; plant community ecology; plant-plant interactions; semi-arid scrubland	LEGUME TREE; PHOSPHORUS TRANSFER; CARBON TRANSFER; MYCORRHIZAL; NETWORKS; PULSES; GRASS; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; PHENOLOGY; ABUNDANCE	Phenological segregation among species in a community is assumed to promote coexistence, as using resources at different times reduces competition. However, other unexplored nonalternative mechanisms can also result in a similar outcome. This study first tests whether plants can redistribute nitrogen (N) among them based on their nutritional temporal demand (i.e. phenology). Field N-15 labelling experiments showed that N-15 is transferred between neighbour plants, mainly from low N-demand (late flowering species, not reproducing yet) to high N-demand plants (early flowering species, currently flowering-fruiting). This can reduce species' dependence on pulses of water availability, and avoid soil N loss through leaching, having relevant implications in the structuring of plant communities and ecosystem functioning. Considering that species phenological segregation is a pervasive pattern in plant communities, this can be a so far unnoticed, but widely spread, ecological process that can predict N fluxes among species in natural communities, and therefore impact our current understanding of community ecology and ecosystem functioning.

Renally Clearable Ultraminiature Chain-Like Gold Nanoparticle Clusters for Multimodal Molecular Imaging of Choroidal Neovascularization	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						age-related macular degeneration; contrast agents; multimodality molecular ocular imaging; optical coherence tomography; photoacoustic microscopy; renally clearable ultraminiature chain-like gold nanoparticles; retinal diseases	OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; PHOTOACOUSTIC MICROSCOPY; SIZE; AGENTS	Currently, available gold nanoparticles (GNPs) typically accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to concerns for their long-term biosafety. To address this long-standing problem, ultraminiature chain-like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed. Via self-assembly of 7-8 nm GNP monomers, GNCs provide redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrast in the near-infrared window. After disassembly, GNCs turn back to GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing their excretion via urine. A one-month longitudinal study in a rabbit eye model demonstrates that GNCs facilitate multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in vivo, non-invasively, with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. GNCs targeting & alpha;(v)& beta;(3) integrins enhance photoacoustic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals from CNV by 25.3-fold and 150%, respectively. With excellent biosafety and biocompatibility demonstrated, GNCs render a first-of-its-kind nanoplatform for biomedical imaging.

Liquid metal (LM) has emerged as a promising material for soft electronics due to its high electrical conductivity (3.4 x 10(6) S m(-1)) and fluidity at room temperature. However, the dispersion of LM nanoparticles and the performance of LM composites in soft electronics applications have not been extensively explored. In this study, a novel approach for the direct dispersion of LM nanoparticles in biocompatible hyaluronic acid (HA) to create multifunctional LM/HA hydrogels is presented. The LM/HA hydrogel displays remarkable electromechanical properties, including high stretchability (2,700%) and conductivity (116 S m(-1)), as well as excellent sensitivity (GF = 4.8) as a sensing material. Specifically, a facial expression monitoring system is developed utilizing the LM/HA hydrogel as the sensing material, along with a microcontroller, signal-processing circuits, and a Bluetooth transceiver. The LM/HA hydrogel adheres closely to the skin surface to ensure the accuracy of facial expression monitoring. In summary, this study not only advances the understanding of the properties of LM but also expands the potential application scenarios of multifunctional LM hydrogels in soft robotics and implantable sensors.

Putting down roots: Afforestation and bank cohesion of Icelandic Rivers	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						added cohesion; birch; grazing exclusion; riparian vegetation; willow	RIPARIAN VEGETATION; JOKULHLAUPS; CORRIDORS; DYNAMICS; STRENGTH; HOLOCENE; EROSION; CLIMATE; FLOW	Riparian vegetation is widely recognized as a critical component of functioning fluvial systems. Human pressures on woody vegetation including riparian areas have had lasting effects, especially at high latitude. In Iceland, prior to human settlement, native downy birch woodlands covered approximately 15%-40% of the land area compared to 1%-2% today. Afforestation efforts include planting seedlings, protecting native forest remnants, and acquiring land areas as national forests. The planted and protected nature of vegetation along rivers within forests provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the various taxa within riparian zones and the channel stabilizing characteristics of the vegetation used in afforestation. We investigated bank properties, sediment textures, and root characteristics within riparian zones along four rivers in forests in Iceland. Bank sediment textures are dominantly sandy loam overlying coarser textures. Undercut banks are common because of erosion of the less cohesive subsurface layer. Quantitative root data indicate that the woody taxa have greater root densities, rooting depths, and more complex root structures than forbs or graminoids. The native downy birch has the highest root densities, with <1 mm roots most abundant. Modeling of added bank cohesion indicates that willow provides up to six times and birch up to four times more added cohesion to the coarse sediment textures comprising stream banks compared to no vegetation. We conclude that planting and protecting the native birch and willow helps to reduce bank erosion, especially where long-term grazing exclusion can be maintained.

This functionality is similar to that of human brains that are composed of numerous neurons, synapses, and their complex connections. To mimic the functionality of the human brain with an electronic device, the resistive switching device and crossbar array has attracted considerable attention for artificial synaptic devices and integrated systems, respectively. For this purpose, the self-rectifying resistive switching cell based on the Si:ZrOx thin film is developed and its reliability characteristics are tested. Four achievements are highlighted in this study. 1) The retention characteristic is improved by the adoption of TaOx thin film as an oxygen reservoir layer. 2) The asymmetric electrodes can make the self-rectifying resistive cell (SRC) have sufficient rectifying characteristic. 3) The linearity of conductance update has a dominant effect on the inference performance compared to that of the conductance range variation. 4) The device of the interface-type resistive switching shows a high enough device yield in the crossbar array device and exhibits reliable multiply-and-accumulate operations in the crossbar array to mimic the human brain-inspired computing system.

Phenotypic and genetic aspects of hereditary ataxia in dogs	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Review						(spino)cerebellar; canine; gene; genetic variant; multiple system degeneration; neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis	CEREBELLAR CORTICAL DEGENERATION; NEURONAL CEROID-LIPOFUSCINOSIS; JACK RUSSELL TERRIERS; KERRY BLUE TERRIER; NEUROAXONAL DYSTROPHY; GRANULOPRIVAL DEGENERATION; SPONGY DEGENERATION; SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA; GM1 GANGLIOSIDOSIS; AUSTRALIAN KELPIE	Hereditary ataxias are a large group of neurodegenerative diseases that have cerebellar or spinocerebellar dysfunction as core feature, occurring as an isolated sign or as part of a syndrome. Based on neuropathology, this group of diseases has so far been classified into cerebellar cortical degenerations, spinocerebellar degenerations, cerebellar ataxias without substantial neurodegeneration, canine multiple system degeneration, and episodic ataxia. Several new hereditary ataxia syndromes are described, but most of these diseases have similar clinical signs and unspecific diagnostic findings, wherefore achieving a definitive diagnosis in these dogs is challenging. Eighteen new genetic variants associated with these diseases have been discovered in the last decade, allowing clinicians to reach a definitive diagnosis for most of these conditions, and allowing breeding schemes to adapt to prevent breeding of affected puppies. This review summarizes the current knowledge about hereditary ataxias in dogs, and proposes to add a "multifocal degenerations with predominant (spino)cerebellar component" category regrouping canine multiple system degeneration, new hereditary ataxia syndromes that do not fit in 1 of the previous categories, as well as specific neuroaxonal dystrophies and lysosomal storage diseases that cause major (spino)cerebellar dysfunction.

Currently, demineralization is generally ascribed to etching by corrosive acids. Herein, the "supervariate" strategy for the demineralization of calcite (the most abundant biomineral on Earth, and a major component of Earth's crust) is disclosed, in which nontoxic solutions of multiple ionic species are used to convert calcite into a multi-ionic amorphous gel that exhibits moderate flowability, which means it can be conveniently collected, stored, transferred, and moulded. This transformation is enabled by the facile formation of highly stable "supervariate" gels featuring high entropy (as a result of their disordered structure, containing various ionic and hydration species) and high resistance to crystallization. Overall, a novel, safe, generic method for etching, gelatinating, and processing solid ceramics is described.

Social vulnerability predictors of drug poisoning mortality: A machine learning analysis in the United States	AMERICAN JOURNAL ON ADDICTIONS			English	Article; Early Access							OPIOID OVERDOSE DEATHS; GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS; TRENDS; INCOME; RATES; US	Background and ObjectivesDrug poisoning is a leading cause of unintentional deaths in the United States. Despite the growing literature, there are a few recent analyses of a wide range of community-level social vulnerability features contributing to drug poisoning mortality. Current studies on this topic face three limitations: often studying a limited subset of vulnerability features, focusing on small sample sizes, or solely including local data. To address this gap, we conducted a national-level analysis to study the impacts of several social vulnerability features in predicting drug mortality rates in the United States. MethodsWe used machine learning to investigate the role of 16 social vulnerability features in predicting drug mortality rates for US counties in 2014, 2016, and 2018-the most recent available data. We estimated each vulnerability feature's gain relative contribution in predicting drug poisoning mortality. ResultsAmong all social vulnerability features, the percentage of noninstitutionalized persons with a disability is the most influential predictor, with a gain relative contribution of 18.6%, followed by population density and the percentage of minority residents (13.3% and 13%, respectively). Percentages of households with no available vehicles, mobile homes, and persons without a high school diploma are the following features with gain relative contributions of 6.3%, 5.8%, and 5.1%, respectively. Conclusion and Scientific SignificanceWe identified social vulnerability features that are most predictive of drug poisoning mortality. Public health interventions and policies targeting vulnerable communities may increase the resilience of these communities and mitigate the overdose death and drug misuse crisis.

BackgroundDuring orthodontic tooth movement, differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) at the tension side of the periodontal ligament mediates new bone formation. WNT5A promotes osteogenesis and its regulator Yes-associated protein (YAP) is responsive to mechanical stimulation in hPDLCs. However, the mechanisms of YAP and WNT5A in alveolar bone remodeling remain unclear. MethodsCyclic stretch was applied to hPDLCs to mimic the orthodontic stretching force. Osteogenic differentiation was determined by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin Red staining, qRT-PCR and western blotting. To detect activation of YAP and expression of WNT5A and its receptor Frizzled-4 (FZD4), western blotting, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and ELISA were performed. Verteporfin, Lats-IN-1, small interfering RNAs and recombinant protein were used to explore the relationship of YAP, WNT5A and FZD4, and the effect of their relationship on stretch-induced osteogenesis of hPDLCs. ResultsWNT5A, FZD4 and nuclear localization of YAP were upregulated by cyclic stretch. YAP positively regulated WNT5A and FZD4 expression and osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs under cyclic stretch by YAP inhibition or activation assay. Knockdown of WNT5A and FZD4 attenuated YAP-induced and stretch-induced osteogenic differentiation. Recombinant WNT5A rescued the suppressed osteogenic differentiation by YAP inhibitor in hPDLCs, whereas knockdown of FZD4 weakened the effect of WNT5A and amplified the suppression. ConclusionsWNT5A/FZD4 could be positively regulated by YAP and the YAP/WNT5A/FZD4 axis mediated osteogenic differentiation of hPDLCs under cyclic stretch. This study provided further insight into the biological mechanism of orthodontic tooth movement.

For this aim, we divided YBCO bulks into three slices horizontally to utilize the YBCO-permanent magnetic guideway (PMG) interaction surface as much as possible. We used whole YBCO above PMGs with different magnetic pole directions (PMG-A and PMG-B) in two lying positions of transversal and longitudinal and investigated levitation and guidance force performances. It is determined that levitation and guidance forces by using YBCO in transversal lying mode are bigger compared to the longitudinal mode. For sliced YBCO, the maximum levitation force increased by 69% and 78%, while the guidance force enhancements are determined as 212% and 91%, compared to the whole YBCO above PMG-A and PMG-B, respectively. The levitation and guidance force density with respect to the total mass of unit a set of slices YBCO increased by 92% and 106%, respectively, compared to the whole YBCO above PMG-B in transversal mode. Since the higher levitation force and the lower total weight of the onboard unit are important parameters in point of the energy efficiency in Maglev and other levitation applications, the result of this study supplies useful data for the engineers and industrial partners.

It particularly occurs under concurrent flow requests and so-called mice flows (MFs): elephant flows (EFs) ratio. Concentrating on a binary vision over flow size classification (EF or MF) results in subsequent unpredicted load imbalance due to neglecting EF's distinctions including a wide range of sizes. As a result, some EFs might utilize a path owing qualities beyond the given EF's demands, while another EF with higher requirements is attending to use an over-utilized path. This article proposes FMap, a fuzzy map for scheduling EFs through our proposed variant of traveling salesperson problem (TSP) toward DCNs. FMap represents a novel EF scheduling scheme that integrates flow prioritization and routing decisions under the event pf parallel incoming flows besides the cooperation of the controller and OpenFlow switches in software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. FMap adopts fuzzy inference process to overcome the vagueness over EF's resource allocation. Mainly, FMap proposes a new variant of TSP (optimized by genetic algorithm) which enables EF's group forwarding with a minimum cost. FMap reduces the total hop count of EFs through considering a single optimal path for delivering groups of EFs that contain a same tag (priority). The outstanding results represent a major improvement as compared with equal cost multiple path, Hedera, Sonoum, and Size-KP-PSO. Particularly, the results illustrate an outperforming by 3.76x, 0.21x, 0.15x, 0.03x, and 0.03x in terms of total hop count, EFs FCT, packet loss, goodput, and received packets as compared with Size-KP-PSO, respectively.

CV-158, PI 691607), a Provisia (BASF) long-grain rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar, was developed by the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center at the H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station near Crowley, LA, and approved for release in 2019. PVL02 is the second rice cultivar released as part of the Provisia Rice System with resistance to Provisia herbicide, containing the active ingredient quizalofop-p-ethyl, an AACase (Group 1) herbicide. PVL02 was derived from the cross 'Cheniere'/BASF1-5 and advanced as an F-2:3 row based on agronomic characteristics. Testing in the Provisia preliminary yield trial in 2014 and the Provisia multi-location test in 2015 indicated good yield potential and favorable agronomic characteristics. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, PVL02 was evaluated in 26 replicated trials across seven locations in Louisiana. Four high-yielding commercial cultivars were included as checks: 'Jupiter', 'CL153', 'Cheniere', and 'PVL01'. The grain yield of PVL02 was 8.2 t ha(-1) compared with 9.2 t ha(-1) for Jupiter, 8.6 t ha(-1) for CL153, 8.5 t ha(-1) for Cheniere, and 7.6 t ha(-1) for PVL01. PVL02 was taller than the checks. The milled grain length was shorter than typical long grains, with a length-to-width ratio of 2.81. It has a typical US long-grain rice cooking quality with intermediate amylose and gel temperature. PVL02 is moderately susceptible to sheath blight, Cercospora spp., and leaf blast and susceptible to bacterial panicle blight.

Persistence of the association between mental health and resource access: A longitudinal reciprocal model in a diverse refugee sample	JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS			English	Article; Early Access							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; MIGRATION LIVING DIFFICULTIES; SYMPTOM CHECKLIST; TRAUMA EXPOSURE; PREVALENCE; IMMIGRANTS; REGRESSION; CONFLICT	Stress associated with resource deprivation is an active social determinant of mental health. However, mixed findings around the strength of this association and its persistence over time obscure optimal interventions to improve mental health in forcibly displaced populations. A reciprocal model was analyzed between resource access and measures of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms at three different assessments conducted 6 months apart (Time [T] 1, T2, and T3). Participants included resettled refugees (N = 290) from three geocultural regions (i.e., Afghanistan, the Great Lakes Region of Africa, and Iraq/Syria). The results showed that although limited resource access at T1 was related to depressive and anxiety symptoms, B = 0.26, SE = 0.16, p = .023, r(2) = 0.55; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, B = 0.20, SE = 0.10, p < .001, r(2) = .56; and culturally specific depression and anxiety at T2, B = 0.22, SE = 0.16, p < .001, r(2) = 0.65, these were not reciprocally related to resource access at T3. The results help clarify the strength and direction of effects between resource deprivation and depression, anxiety , and PTSD sympotms over time. Although resource deprivation is predictive of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms among recently resettled refugees, the effect may not persist in the long term. These findings have critical implications, including the urgency of ensuring initial access to resources for resettled refugees to stave off the development of depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms, as delaying immediate resource access may result in the development of chronic, hard-to-treat mental health disorders.

Thus, we investigate the effect of cilostazol added to a DAPT on the clinical outcomes after EVT in patients with diabetes using a nationwide, multicenter, real-world registry. Methods and ResultsA total of 990 patients with diabetes who underwent EVT were enrolled from the retrospective cohorts of a Korean multicenter EVT registry and were divided according to the antiplatelet regimen (TAPT [n=350; 35.4%] versus DAPT [n=640; 64.6%]). After propensity score matching based on clinical characteristics, a total of 350 pairs were compared for clinical outcomes. The primary end points were major adverse limb events, a composite of major amputation, minor amputation, and reintervention. For the matched study groups, the lesion length was 125.4 & PLUSMN;102.0 mm, and severe calcification was observed in 47.4%. The technical success rate (96.9% versus 94.0%; P=0.102) and the complication rate (6.9% versus 6.6%; P>0.999) were similar between the TAPT and DAPT groups. At 2-year follow-up, the incidence of major adverse limb events (16.6% versus 19.4%; P=0.260) did not differ between the 2 groups. However, the TAPT group showed less minor amputation than the DAPT group (2.0% versus 6.3%; P=0.004). In multivariate analysis, TAPT was an independent predictor of minor amputation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.354 [95% CI, 0.158-0.794]; P=0.012). ConclusionsIn patients with diabetes undergoing EVT for peripheral artery disease, TAPT did not decrease the incidence of major adverse limb events but may be associated with a decreased risk of minor amputation.

The calculations show that complexation of Fe(II) with NTA significantly facilitates the H2O2 activation. The ferric-hydroperoxo intermediate NTA Fe(III) OOH predominantly decays via the disproportionation into NTA Fe(II) OH2 and NTA-Fe(IV)-O involving the formation of a mu-1,2-hydroperoxo-bridged biferric intermediate. In this mechanism, the bridged hydroperoxo is reduced by hydroperoxo ligand rather than by Fe(III). On the one hand, the NTA Fe(III) OOH is sluggish to undergo hydrogen abstraction; on the other hand, it is a good nucleophile that may perform aldehyde deformylation. The present calculations suggest that both (OH)-O-center dot and Fe(IV)=O are generated in the NTA-assisted Fenton system. However, the polycarboxylate ligand provides a favorable environment for H2O2 to accumulate around iron ion through hydrogen bonding. This promotes the quenching of Fe(IV) O by H2O2, rationalizing why the Fe(IV) O species is hardly detected in the NTA-assisted Fenton system.

Bradley			The importance of cryptic diversity in the conservation of wide-ranging species: The red-footed tortoise Chelonoidis <i>carbonarius </i>in Colombia	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						conservation genomics; environmental niche modelling; genotype-environment association analysis; local adaptation; population structure; Testudinidae	EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; R-PACKAGE; N-E; SOFTWARE; DIVERGENCE; RESOURCE; CLUSTERS; PROGRAM; TURTLES; NUMBER	Wide-ranging species are seldom considered conservation priorities, yet they have the potential to harbour genetically deeply differentiated units across environments or ecological barriers, including some that warrant taxonomic recognition. Documenting such cryptic genetic diversity is especially important for wide-ranging species that are in decline, as they may comprise a set of even more endangered lineages or species with small distributions. However, studies of wide-ranging species, particularly when they cross political borders, are extremely challenging. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to conduct detailed local analyses in combination with less detailed, range-wide studies. We used this approach with the red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonarius), a threatened species likely to contain cryptic diversity given its vast range and the distinctive ecoregions that it inhabits. Previous single-gene molecular studies indicated the presence of at least five lineages, two of which occur in different ecoregions separated by the Andes within Colombia. We used a comprehensive genomic analysis to test the hypothesis of cryptic diversity within the single jurisdiction of Colombia. We used a combination of restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing and environmental niche modelling to provide three independent lines of evidence that support the presence of important cryptic diversity that may deserve taxonomic recognition: allopatric reproductive isolation, local adaptation and ecological divergence. We also provide a fine-scale genetic map with the distribution of conservation units in Colombia. As we complete ongoing range-wide analyses and make taxonomic adjustments, we recommend that the two lineages in Colombia be treated as separate units for conservation purposes.

To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverages cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin are embedded into a DNA-based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle-hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen-specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well-protected. This work highlights the benefits of combining nanoparticulate antigen delivery systems with immunostimulatory hydrogels into a single platform, and the approach can be readily generalized to a wide range of infectious diseases.

We aimed to demonstrate plasma miR-140-3p, miR-130a-3p, and miR-320b as diagnostic biomarkers in AIS.GSE110993 and GSE86291 datasets were analyzed to obtain plasma differentially expressed miRNAs between AIS and healthy control subjects (HCs). We further applied RT-qPCR for the validation in 85 AIS patients and 85 HCs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were conducted to evaluate their diagnostic utility in AIS. Correlation was analyzed between DEmiRNAs and clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as inflammatory markers. The plasma levels of miR-140-3p, miR-130a-3p, and miR-320b were found to be consistently altered in both GSE110993 and GSE86291 datasets. In comparison to HCs, AIS patients at admission exhibited lower levels of miR-140-3p and miR-320b and higher level of miR-130a-3p in their plasma. The ROC analysis revealed that plasma miR-140-3p, miR-130a-3p, and miR-320b had area under the curve values of 0.790, 0.831, and 0.907, respectively. When combined, these miRNAs showed superior discriminatory power with a sensitivity of 91.76% and specificity of 95.29%. Plasma miR-140-3p and miR-320b negatively correlated glucose levels and inflammatory markers (IL-6, MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF) in AIS patients. Conversely, plasma miR-130a-3p levels were positively associated with glucose levels and these markers. Plasma miR-140-3p, miR-130a-3p, and miR-320b levels varied significantly among AIS patients with different NIHSS scores. Plasma miR-140-3p, miR-130a-3p, and miR-320b had high diagnostic value in AIS patients, which were correlated with inflammation and severity in stroke.

The rod shaped nanostructures having the highest negative surface potential and lowest BET surface area compared to other morphologies, were found to show the highest radical scavenging ability which was corroborated with the maximum decrease of the DPPH absorption peak in UV-vis spectra, largest attenuation of the DPPH free radical signal in EPR intensity and the maximum quenching of the fluorescent intensity of the NSCDs probe.

Based on their attributes, we predominantly evaluated the treatment and support provided to women with substance use disorder. The rates of childhood (before the age of 18) traumatic experiences (physical, psychological, and sexual abuse and neglect) and lifetime intimate partner violence were significantly higher in women than in men. The history of treatment for substance use disorder was also significantly higher in women than in men, at 15.8% for men and 42.4% for women [?(2)(1) = 41.223, p < 0.001]. Logistic regression analysis was performed using the treatment history of substance use disorder as the dependent variable. The results showed that treatment history was significantly associated with the total drug abuse screening test-20 score and suicidal ideation in men and with survivors of child abuse and eating disorders in women. A comprehensive assessment is required for several issues, such as child abuse, domestic violence, trauma symptoms, eating disorders, and drug problems. Moreover, an integrated treatment for substance use disorder, trauma, and eating disorders is required for female stimulant offenders.

To resolve this issue, the fiber paper- and cotton cloth-based Al-air batteries were proposed, which exploited the capillary force from the paper (FP) and cotton cloth (CC) to deliver the solutions and eliminated the external pump. The physical features of the FP and CC were gained including the surface morphologies, surface elementary analysis, liquid absorption and flow rates. CC owned larger liquid absorption and faster flow rate due to its hierarchically woven-spun fiber structure, compared to the randomly oriented fibers of the FP, although the surface of the CC demonstrated lower O/C ratio than that of the FP. So, the performance of the CC-based Al-air battery was largely higher than that of the FP-based battery. The performance of the CC-based Al-air battery was optimal at 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte and the anode-to-cathode surface area ratio of 1 : 4, with the peak power density of 14.95 +/- 0.28 mW cm(-2), and the maximum current density of 36.61 +/- 0.54 mA cm(-2). To apply the CC-based Al-air battery, the two-battery pack connected in series was assembled to drive a timer and light 9 LEDs.

Biosynthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using ethanolic extract of Musa sapientum unripe fruit were performed. The nanoparticles demonstrated an absorption peak at 554 nm with particle sizes ranging from 5.45 to 104.44 nm. High negative zeta potential value of -33.97 mV confirmed the high stability of AuNPs. The presence of bioconstituents responsible for capping and stabilization was indicated by intensity changes of several peaks from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the biosynthesized AuNPs against important pathogens ranged from 10 to 40 mu g mL(-1). Synthesized nanoparticles at 0.062 to 0.5 x MIC significantly inhibited biofilm formation in all the tested microorganisms (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy and confocal scanning laser microscopy images clearly illustrated in disruption and architectural changes of microbial biofilms at sub-MIC of biosynthesized AuNPs. Excellent antioxidant and antityrosinase activities of AuNPs were observed. The biosynthesized AuNPs at 20 mu g mL(-1) significantly inhibited nitric oxide production by 93% in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, compared with control (p < 0.05). The biosynthesized AuNPs at 0.6 to 40 mu g mL(-1) demonstrated no toxic effects on L929 fibroblast cells.

Healthy Lifestyle Index and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Among Postmenopausal Women With Normal Body Mass Index	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						body mass index; cardiovascular disease; healthy lifestyle index; postmenopausal women; prospective study	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; INFLAMMATORY MARKERS; RELIABILITY; CONSUMPTION; OBESITY; IMPACT; CANCER	BackgroundA lifestyle comprising a healthy diet, light alcohol consumption, no smoking, and moderate or intense physical activity has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We examined the association of a healthy lifestyle index (HLI), derived from scores for each of these components plus waist circumference, with the risk of incident CVD and CVD subtypes in postmenopausal women with normal body mass index (18.5-<25.0 kg/m(2)). Methods and ResultsWe studied 40 118 participants in the Women's Health Initiative, aged 50 to 79 years at enrollment, with a normal body mass index and no history of CVD. The HLI score was categorized into quintiles. We estimated multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for the association of HLI with risk of CVD and CVD subtypes using Cox regression models. A total of 3821 cases of incident CVD were ascertained during a median follow-up of 20.1 years. Compared with the lowest quintile (unhealthiest lifestyle), higher HLI quintiles showed inverse associations with the risk of CVD (HRquintile-2=0.74 [95% CI, 0.67-0.81]; HRquintile-3=0.66 [95% CI, 0.60-0.72]; HRquintile-4=0.57 [95% CI, 0.51-0.63]; and HRquintile-5=0.48 [95% CI, 0.43-0.54], P-trend=<0.001). HLI was also inversely associated with risks of stroke, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina, and coronary revascularization. Subgroup analyses, stratified by age (& LE;63 years vs >63 years), body mass index (</& GE; 22.0 kg/m(2)), and general health status (absence/presence of hypertension, diabetes, or lipid-lowering drug use) also showed inverse associations between HLI and risk of CVD. ConclusionsAmong postmenopausal women with a normal body mass index, adherence to a healthy lifestyle is associated with a reduced risk of clinical CVD and CVD subtypes, underscoring the cardiovascular benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, even for women with a healthy weight.

The title compound tris(benzophenoneimino)phosphane (P(bpi)(3)) 1 was prepared with a convenient one-pot approach: benzophenone imine was deprotonated using MeMgCl and reacted with PBr3 in diglyme. The method could be considered as a method of choice for preparing other (amino)phosphanes in case lithio-intermediates and/or protonated phosphane is out of consideration. Phosphane 1 is further used to prepare a range of related phosphonium cations and phosphazenes. Phosphonium cations were deprotonated to assess the stability of the resulting phosphonium ylides. In some cases, the bulky substances were capable of forming P-N heterocycles. Experimental (MeCN) and computational (MeCN, THF, gas-phase) basicities of benzophenone imine, phosphane 1, phosphonium ylides, and phosphazenes, as well as some representative XRD structures, are presented and discussed.

Goldenrod herbariomics: Hybrid-sequence capture reveals the phylogeny of <i>Solidago</i>	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Anchored Hybrid Enrichment; Asteraceae; Chrysoma; herbarium specimens; North America; Oligoneuron; polyploidy	NEMORALIS COMPOSITAE; ASTERACEAE; ORIGIN; CYTOGEOGRAPHY; COMPLEX; TAXA	PremiseThe phylogenetic relationships among the ca. 138 species of goldenrods (Solidago; Asteraceae) have been difficult to infer due to species richness, and shallow interspecific genetic divergences. This study aims to overcome these obstacles by combining extensive sampling of goldenrod herbarium specimens with the use of a custom Solidago hybrid-sequence capture probe set. MethodsA set of tissues from herbarium samples comprising ca. 90% of Solidago species was assembled and DNA was extracted. A custom hybrid-sequence capture probe set was designed, and data from 854 nuclear regions were obtained and analyzed from 209 specimens. Maximum likelihood and coalescent approaches were used to estimate the genus phylogeny for 157 diploid samples. ResultsAlthough DNAs from older specimens were both more fragmented and produced fewer sequencing reads, there was no relationship between specimen age and our ability to obtain sufficient data at the target loci. The Solidago phylogeny was generally well-supported, with 88/155 (57%) nodes receiving & GE;95% bootstrap support. Solidago was supported as monophyletic, with Chrysoma pauciflosculosa identified as sister. A clade comprising Solidago ericameriodes, Solidago odora, and Solidago chapmanii was identified as the earliest diverging Solidago lineage. The previously segregated genera Brintonia and Oligoneuron were identified as placed well within Solidago. These and other phylogenetic results were used to establish four subgenera and fifteen sections within the genus. ConclusionsThe combination of expansive herbarium sampling and hybrid-sequence capture data allowed us to quickly and rigorously establish the evolutionary relationships within this difficult, species-rich group.

J	Shi, HW; Liu, ZQ				Shi, Hongwei; Liu, Ziqiang			Study on mixing characteristics of multichamber static mixer	ENGINEERING REPORTS			English	Article; Early Access						dynamic simulation; natural gas; static mixer; turbulent flow	NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; HEAT-TRANSFER; FLOW-FIELD; ENHANCEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; MICROMIXERS; MICROCHANNEL; CATALYST	This study presents a specialized mixer design for gas burners aimed at improving the efficiency of phase mixing while minimizing system resistance and energy consumption. The proposed design utilizes a multi-cavity mixer employing both radial and axial mixing techniques, eliminating the need for additional power supply. Full premixed combustion of small gas-fired industrial boiler has the function of "inhibiting" NOx emission from the source, and good mixing of fuel and combustion supporting air in the early stage is the primary prerequisite for realizing full premixed combustion denitration. In this article, a radial multichamber static mixer is designed following the characteristics of full premixed mixing in gas-fired industrial boilers. The results demonstrate that the maximum pressure drop of the static mixer is 806 Pa; for gas and air branch pipes, the resistance coefficient f decreases rapidly with the increase in Reynolds number; when Re = 1.2 x 10(3), the resistance coefficient in the air branch pipe decreases slowly; when Re = 4.5 x 10(3), the resistance coefficient of gas branch pipe decreases slowly. Additionally, the maximum calculation error of symmetrical gas branch pipe is 9.1%. The static mixer's inlet exhibits a converted velocity of 24 m/s, and the outlet demonstrates an airflow velocity of 23.2 m/s. As a result, a kinetic energy loss of 6.5% is observed. The static mixing chamber makes the airflow rotate and causes different gases to shear and mix. The mixing channel has the function of correcting the airflow deviation, especially for the sudden expansion section. Generally, the two gases can be mixed evenly at the outlet of the mixer. The standard k-e model and realizable k-e model are employed to simulate the sudden expansion channel, and indicate that the standard k-e has a wider range of influence. Further investigation is recommended to better comprehend and optimize this particular area of influence.

Trajectories of ADHD medication use before, during, and after pregnancy: A population-based study from Norway and Sweden	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						ADHD; drug utilization; pharmacoepidemiology; pregnancy	METHYLPHENIDATE; EXPOSURE	Purpose: To describe ADHD medication use trajectories around pregnancy in Norway and Sweden.Methods: We identified pregnancies resulting in births using linked data from birth and prescribed drug registers of Norway (2006-2019, N = 813 107) and Sweden (2007-2018, N = 1 269 146). We restricted to women who filled prescriptions for ADHD medication during pregnancy or in the year before or after. We described exposure as use versus no use, and total amount of drug dispensed in defined daily doses (DDDs). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct medication use trajectories.Results: In total, 13 286 women (0.64%) filled a prescription for ADHD medication. We identified four trajectory groups: continuers (5.7%), interrupters (23.8%), discontinuers (49.5%), and late initiators (21.0%). Discontinuers were younger, continuers were older on average. More women continued medication in recent years (2014-2019). Most discontinuers (60.7%) were nulliparous; more initiators and continuers had one or multiple previous births, respectively. Continuers were least likely to live with a partner (65.8%). Discontinuers were least likely (24.7%) and continuers most likely (37.6%) to smoke at the beginning of pregnancy. More continuers used amphetamine derivatives and were most likely to use other psychotropics. On modeling continuers, we identified three dose-trajectory groups which suggested that most women reduced medication dose during pregnancy.Conclusions: Most pregnant women discontinued or interrupted their ADHD medication during pregnancy, but more continued in recent years. Continuers were more likely to have had previous births, less likely to have lived with a partner, and may have had additional comorbidities warranting the use of other psychotropics.

The aim of this study was to investigate abnormal alterations in resting-state effective connectivity within the Papez circuit and their association with cognitive decline in presbycusis patients. The spectral dynamic causal modelling (spDCM) approach was used for resting-state effective connectivity analysis in 61 presbycusis patients and 52 healthy controls (HCs) within the Papez circuit. The hippocampus (HPC), mamillary body (MB), anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum (Sub) and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) were selected as the regions of interest (ROIs). The fully connected model difference in effective connectivity between the two groups was assessed, and the correlation between effective connectivity alteration and cognitive scale was analysed. We found that presbycusis patients demonstrated decreased effective connectivity from MB, PCC, and Sub to ACC relative to HCs, whereas higher effective connectivity strength was shown from HPC to MB, from ATN to PHG and from PHG to Sub. The effective connectivity from PHG to Sub was significantly negatively correlated with the complex figure test (CFT)-delay score (rho = -0.259, p = 0.044). The results support and reinforce the role of abnormal effective connectivity within the Papez circuit in the pathophysiology of presbycusis-related cognitive impairment and reveal its potential as a novel imaging marker.

Recent studies suggest that the radiological infiltrative feature (r-IF) of renal tumors is strongly correlated with poor oncologic outcomes in locally advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study investigated the prognostic impact of r-IF of primary renal tumors in metastatic RCC (mRCC) in comparison with International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk model.Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 91 patients with previously untreated mRCC. Dynamic computed tomography of the primary renal tumor was reviewed to assess r-IF, defined as a focally/extensively ill-defined tumor interface with normal renal parenchyma.Results. The median age was 67 years, and 69 patients (76%) were men. Prior nephrectomy was performed in 47 patients (52%). The median size of the primary renal tumor was 6.7 cm, and 50 patients (55%) presented with cT3-4 stage. Overall, 25 (28%)/52 (57%)/14 (15%) patients were classified into IMDC favorable/intermediate/poor-risk groups, respectively. An image review identified r-IFs in the primary renal tumor in 40 patients (44%). The incidences of r-IFs were 28%/46%/64% in IMDC favorable/intermediate/poor-risk groups, respectively. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, 31 patients (34%) died of RCC. On multivariable analysis, r-IF and IMDC intermediate-poor risks were independently associated with poor cancer-specific survival (CSS). Two-year CSS were 64%/87% in patients with/without r-IF, respectively. C-index was improved from 0.73 to 0.81 by adding r-IF to the IMDC risk factors.Conclusions. R-IF of the primary renal tumor was an independent risk factor for poor CSS in patients with mRCC, which may improve the prognostic accuracy when combined with the IMDC risk model.

The proposed voltage-mode FWR comprises a single active building block, four diodes, and three grounded resistors without needing any passive element matching problems. It does not suffer from any bias voltages and/or currents; therefore, it does not need extra circuitry. It can simultaneously provide positive and negative rectifications; thus, it is flexible. The proposed FWR has high input impedance; accordingly, it can be easily cascadable. Several simulations via the SPICE program and some experiments by using the AD844s are achieved. 0.18-mu m TSMC CMOS technology parameters are used in the simulations.

Some nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) indirectly detect pathogen effectors by monitoring their host targets. In Arabidopsis thaliana, RIN4 is targeted by multiple sequence-unrelated effectors and activates immune responses mediated by RPM1 and RPS2. These effectors trigger cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, but the corresponding NLRs have yet not been identified. To identify N. benthamiana NLRs (NbNLRs) that recognize Arabidopsis RIN4-targeting effectors, we conducted a rapid reverse genetic screen using an NbNLR VIGS library. . We identified that the N. benthamiana homolog of Ptr1 (Pseudomonas tomato race 1) recognizes the Pseudomonas effectors AvrRpt2, AvrRpm1, and AvrB. . We demonstrated that recognition of the Xanthomonas effector AvrBsT and the Pseudomonas effector HopZ5 is conferred independently by the N. benthamiana homolog of Ptr1 and ZAR1. Interestingly, the recognition of HopZ5 and AvrBsT is contributed unequally by Ptr1 and ZAR1 in N. benthamiana and Capsicum annuum. In addition, we showed that the RLCK XII family protein JIM2 is required for the NbZAR1-dependent recognition of AvrBsT and HopZ5. . The recognition of sequence-unrelated effectors by NbPtr1 and NbZAR1 provides an additional example of convergently evolved effector recognition. Identification of key components involved in Ptr1 and ZAR1-mediated immunity could reveal unique mechanisms of expanded effector recognition.

In this work, PTES systems based on a transcritical CO2 charging process are investigated. A two-zone water storage tank with a storage temperature of 115 degrees C is used as thermal energy storage. For discharge, an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and, alternatively, a transcritical CO2 heat engine are investigated. The considered concepts are modelled and simulated as stationary processes using the EBSILON Professional software. The scaling is based on an electrical input power of 5 MW. Using an ORC with the working fluid R1234yf for the discharging process results in the highest round-trip efficiency of 36.8%. The component costs of the different configurations are estimated using cost functions. On the basis of this, the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) is calculated. The configuration with the ORC as the discharging process has the lowest LCOS of 59.2 eurocents (kWh)(-)(1). In addition, the technological maturity is determined using the technology readiness level scale. There are no prototypes of the investigated PTES systems yet. Therefore, further investigations must be carried out to implement the technology in the future.

Stable isotope values (d(13)C and d(15)N) of white muscle from dolphinfish (n = 220) captured at different locations across the ETP (i.e., Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru and oceanic areas) were normalized to copepod baseline stable isotope values to estimate dolphinfish trophic position, movements and population dispersal. Movement or residence patterns were inferred from the difference in d(15)N values (& UDelta;N-15(dolphinfish-copepod)& PTSTHOUSND;) between copepods and dolphinfish muscle. Baseline corrected isotope values (d(13)C(dolphinfish-copepod) and d(15)N(dolphinfish-copepod)) of dolphinfish muscle were used to estimate isotopic niche metrics and infer population dispersal across isoscapes. Values of d(13)C and d(15)N differed between juvenile and adult dolphinfish and across the ETP. Trophic position estimates ranged from 3.1 to 6.0 with a mean of 4.6. Adults and juveniles had similar trophic position estimates, whereas isotopic niche areas (SEA & PTSTHOUSND;(2)) of adults were greater relative to juveniles in every location. Adult dolphinfish showed "moderate movement by some individuals" in all locations based on & UDelta;N-15(dolphinfish-copepod) values, except for Costa Rica where adults were classified with "high degree of movement by some individuals" whereas juveniles showed "limited movement" in all areas except Mexico. Population dispersal based on & UDelta;N-15(dolphinfish-copepod) values showed "moderate" and "high" dispersal for adults and "no dispersal" for most juveniles, except for Mexico. This study provides insight into potential dolphinfish spatial mobility across an area of interest for multiple nations, which can help to improve stock assessments and management of the species.

The current study evaluated the relationship between preoperative smoking status in patients suffering from osteoarthritic pain and POD after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). MethodsA total of 254 patients who had undergone unilateral TKA were enrolled between November 2021 and December 2022, with no gender limitation. Preoperatively, patients' visual analog scale (VAS) scores at rest and during movement, hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) scores, pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) scores and smoking status were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of POD, which was evaluated by the confusion assessment method (CAM). ResultsA total of 188 patients had complete datasets for final analysis. POD was diagnosed in 41 of 188 patients (21.8%) who had complete data for analysis. The incidence of smoking was significantly higher in Group POD than in Group Non-POD (22 of 41 patients [54%] vs. 47 of 147 patients [32%], p < 0.05). The postoperative hospital stays were also longer than those of Group Non-POD (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative smoking (OR: 4.018, 95% CI: 1.158-13.947, p = 0.028) was a risk factor for the occurrence of POD in patients with TKA. The length of hospital stay was correlated with the occurrence of POD. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that patients who smoked preoperatively were at increased risk of developing POD following TKA.

However, previous calibration patterns and the robustness of the adjoint processing methods are limited due to the fisheye distortion and various lighting. This problem leads to additional manual intervention in the data collection. Moreover, it is arduous to accurately detect the board target under fisheye's distortion. To increase the robustness in this task, we present a novel encoded board "Meta-Board" and a learning-based target detection method. Additionally, an automatic image orthorectification is integrated to alleviate the distortion effect on the target iteratively until convergence. A low-cost control field with the proposed boards is built for the experiment. Results on both virtual and real camera lenses and multi-camera rigs show that our method can be robustly used in calibrating the fisheye camera and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy.

Here we were trying to clarify the role of PMN-MDSCs in the pathogenesis of RA and its specific mechanisms. We detected the frequencies and counts of PMN-MDSCs, TNF-a(+) B cells and Ki67(+) B cells in spleen and inflamed joints of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice using flow cytometry. The pathological role of PMN-MDSCs was examined by anti-Ly6G neutralizing antibodies against PMN-MDSCs or adoptive transfer of PMN-MDSCs. And the modulation of PMN-MDSCs on B cells was conducted by coculture assays, RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR, and so on. The mechanism of BAFF regulating B cells was verified through western blot and flow cytometry. PMN-MDSCs accumulated in the spleen and joints of CIA mice. PMN-MDSCs depletion could alleviate the arthritis severity, which was accompanied by decreased TNF-a secretion and proliferation of B cells. And its adoptive transfer also facilitated disease progress. Furthermore, PMN-MDSCs from CIA mice had higher expression level of BAFF, which regulated TNF-a expression, proliferation and apoptosis of B cells in vitro. What's more, BAFF promoted phosphorylation of BTK/NF-?B signalling pathway. And Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) could reverse the effect of BAFF on TNF-a expression of B cells. Our study suggested that PMN-MDSCs enhanced disease severity of CIA and manipulated TNF-a expression, proliferation and apoptosis of B cells via BAFF, furthermore, BAFF promoted TNF-a expression through BTK/NF-?B signalling pathway, which demonstrated a novel pathogenesis of PMN-MDSCs in CIA.

Hypophosphataemia definitions, incidence and associated outcomes in paediatric intensive care: A retrospective cohort study in post-cardiac surgical patients &lt;2 years of age	JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH			English	Article; Early Access						hypophosphataemia; nutritional support; paediatric intensive care	CRITICALLY-ILL CHILDREN; REFEEDING SYNDROME; RISK-FACTORS	Aim: Hypophosphataemia has been linked to higher morbidity and mortality in intensive care but there is inconsistency in the definition of hypophosphataemia for infants and children. We aimed to determine the incidence of hypophosphataemia in a group of at-risk children in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and associations with patient characteristics and clinical outcomes using three different hypophosphataemia thresholds. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 205 post-cardiac surgical patients <2 years of age admitted to Starship Child Health PICU, Auckland, New Zealand. Patient demographics and routine daily biochemistry for 14 days after PICU admission were collected. Rates of sepsis, mortality and length of mechanical ventilation were compared between groups with different serum phosphate concentrations. Results: Out of 205 children, 6 (3%), 50 (24%) and 159 ( 78%) had hypophosphataemia at thresholds of <0.7, <1.0 and <1.4 mmol/L, respectively. There were no differences in gestational age at birth, sex, ethnicity or mortality in those with and without hypophosphataemia at any threshold. Children with a serum phosphate <1.4 mmol/L had more mean (SD) total hours of mechanical ventilation (85.2 (79.6) vs. 54.9 (36.2) h, P = 0.02) and those with mean serum phosphate <1.0 mmol/L had more mean hours of mechanical ventilation (119.4 (102.8) vs. 65.2 ( 54.8) h, P < 0.0001), episodes of sepsis (14% vs. 5%, P = 0.03) and longer length of stay (6.4 (4.8-20.7) vs. 4.9 (3.9-6.8) days, P = 0.02). Conclusions: Hypophosphataemia is common in this PICU cohort and serum phosphate <1.0 mmol/L is associated with increased morbidity and length of stay.

Although the tumorigenesis of FISSs is still uncertain, there is a consensus that FISS is associated with chronic inflammation caused by irritation of injection-related trauma and foreign chemical substances. Chronic inflammation can provide a proper microenvironment for tumour development, which has been known as one of the risk factors of tumorigenesis in many tumours. To investigate the tumorigenesis of FISS and screen for its potential therapeutic targets, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inflammation-enhancing enzyme, was selected as a target for this study. In vitro experiments using FISS- and normal tissue-derived primary cells and robenacoxib, a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, were performed. The results demonstrated that expression of COX-2 could be detected in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded FISS tissues and FISS-derived primary cells. Cell viability, migration and colony formation of FISS-derived primary cells were inhibited, and cell apoptosis was enhanced by robenacoxib in a dose-dependent manner. However, susceptibility to robenacoxib varied in different lines of FISS primary cells and was not completely correlated with COX-2 expression. Our results suggest that COX-2 inhibitors could be potential adjuvant therapeutics against FISSs.

This novel 3D structure presented an interesting single-crystal to single-crystal transformation when the coordinated DMSO molecules were replaced by H2O, forming a well-known Cd Prussian Blue analogue (Cd-PBA). This occurrence is a rare phenomenon in transition metal hexacyanometallates and may provide a new strategy for obtaining new structures and overcoming the difficulty of growing single crystals of Prussian Blue analogues. Subsequent gas sorption and separation investigations based on the obtained Cd-PBA were also carried out to evaluate its C2H2/CO2 separation capability.

The objective of this study was to examine the role of patient race in QoL at least 2 years after pediatric HSCT. ProcedureWe conducted a retrospective chart review of patients under 21 years of age at diagnosis who received an allogeneic transplant at our institution between January 2007 and December 2017. Patient QoL was assessed using the Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory Generic Score Scales (PedsQL TM 4.0) at least 2 years post transplant. Patient demographic, treatment, and transplant outcome data were obtained for subsequent analysis, where patient race was categorized as either Black, White, Hispanic, or Native American. ResultsData were collected on 86 pediatric patients who underwent HSCT. Forty patients (46.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 29 (33.7%) Hispanic, 10 (11.6%) Black, and seven (8.1%) Native American. Where preliminary analyses indicated a difference in QoL by patient race, there were no significant differences in physical, emotional, social, and school functioning by patient race after adjusting for transplant characteristics (age at transplant, sex, diagnosis, donor type, and conditioning regimen) and determinants of socioeconomic status (insurance type, estimated household income). ConclusionsPediatric patients had comparable QoL, regardless of race, at a median of 3 years after HSCT in our study cohort.

Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a potential method to address these shortcomings. The objectives of this study were to apply SWE to the ELMs, compare SWE measures to standard clinical metrics, and determine group differences in pMTD and typical voice users before and after vocal load. Methods: SWE measurements of the ELMs from ultrasound examinations of the anterior neck, supraglottic compression severities from laryngoscopic images, cepstral peak prominences (CPP) from voice recordings, and self-perceptual ratings of vocal effort and discomfort were obtained in voice users with (N = 30) and without (N = 35) pMTD, before and after a vocal load challenge. Results: ELM tension significantly increased from rest-to-voiced conditions in both groups. However, the groups were similar in their ELM stiffness levels at SWE at baseline, during vocalization, and post-vocal load. Levels of vocal effort and discomfort and supraglottic compression were significantly higher and CPP was significantly lower in the pMTD group. Vocal load had a significant effect on vocal effort and discomfort but not on laryngeal or acoustic patterns. Conclusion: SWE can be used to quantify ELM tension with voicing. Although the pMTD group reported significantly higher levels of vocal effort and vocal tract discomfort and, on average, exhibited significantly more severe supraglottic compression and lower CPP values, there were no group differences in levels of ELM tension using SWE.

The study sample (n = 513) was deeply phenotyped, consisting of 452 patients from tertiary care with mood disorders, anxiety disorders (ANX), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, and/or substance use disorders (SUD) and 61 unaffected comparison individuals. We computed subject-specific polygenic risk score (PRS) profiles and assessed their associations with psychiatric diagnoses, comorbidity status, as well as cross-disorder behavioral dimensions derived from a rich battery of psychopathology assessments. High PRSs for depression were unselectively associated with the diagnosis of SUD, ADHD, ANX, and mood disorders (p < 1e-4). In the dimensional approach, four distinct functional domains were uncovered, namely the negative valence, social, cognitive, and regulatory systems, closely matching the major functional domains proposed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. Critically, the genetic predisposition for depression was selectively reflected in the functional aspect of negative valence systems (R-2 = 0.041, p = 5e-4) but not others. This study adds evidence to the ongoing discussion about the misalignment between current psychiatric nosology and the underlying psychiatric genetic etiology and underscores the effectiveness of the dimensional approach in both the functional characterization of psychiatric patients and the delineation of the genetic liability for psychiatric disorders.

As a taxon that is notoriously difficult to classify morphologically, the taxonomic significance of pollen morphology has been discussed in previous studies. However, there was only limited study on the evolution of palynological and macroscopic character in this genus before. In this paper, we observed pollen of 143 species of Impatiens, including all representatives of infrageneric groups and discussed their taxonomic value. Meanwhile, based on the reconstructed phylogenetic framework, we selected five pollen traits, and nine macroscopic traits including both vegetative and reproductive organs for evolutionary analysis. The character reconstruction showed that the morphology and number of aperture, granules in lumina, seed number of per capsule, number of sepals, lateral united petals connate, spur length, and phyllotaxy could be identified as unambiguous, while other characters were ambiguous in the last common ancestor of Impatiens. The results of comprehensively macroscopic characters and palynological evidence suggest that these traits experienced a complicated evolution, exhibit high levels of instability and variability and occur character multiple reversals in the evolutionary processes of Impatiens due to different selection pressures. In addition, we found that there is an evident mosaic evolution in this genus. Pollen and macroscopic character are conserved with a slower evolutionary rate in the I. subgen. Clavicarpa, however, these characters showed higher diversity with a rapid rate of evolution in the I. subgen. Impatiens. Furthermore, the relationship between floral morphology and pollinators was discussed.

The acid-catalyzed deuteration is facilitated by deuterated trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, [D]triflic acid, CF3SO3D, TfOD, which acts as both the reaction solvent and the source of the deuterium label. The mild conditions enable room temperature hydrogen/deuterium exchange for most of the para-substituted aromatic amine derivatives studied. In addition, short reaction times and a high degree of aromatic deuteration are achieved and isolation of the product is simple. The optical activity of the chiral aralkyl amines studied was preserved.

While research shows that Black African immigrants experience the largest wage disadvantage, studies rarely discuss whether country-context-formed by immigration policy and migration history-matters for their wages and whether race matters differently across place. We use Israeli and US data to determine whether Ethiopian immigrants are most disadvantaged across country contexts. Our results indicate that Ethiopian immigrants' credentials are higher in the United States, but that does not lead to higher relative wages than in Israel. Because we find that Ethiopian immigrants who are most similar to the native-born earn nearly identical wages to the most marginalized groups in both countries, it is clear that country context plays only a small role in wage disparities. Instead, discrimination and unobserved differences between groups are most important.

Their incidence seems to be higher in patients with oncogene-driven tumours, especially those with EGFR-mutated or ALK-rearranged tumours. Although targeted treatments demonstrate significant efficacy regarding BM, they only apply to a minority of NSCLC patients. On the other hand, systemic therapies for nononcogenic-driven NSCLC with BM have shown limited clinical benefit. In recent years, immunotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy has been adopted as a new standard of care in first-line therapy. This approach seems to be beneficial to patients with BM in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Combined immune checkpoint inhibition as well as the combination of immunotherapy and radiation therapy show promising results with significant, but overall acceptable toxicity. A pragmatic approach of allowing enrolment of patients with untreated or symptomatic BM in randomised trials evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors strategies, possibly coupled with central nervous system-related endpoints may be needed to generate data to refine treatment for this patient population.

Despite the long-standing (about 100 years) evidence supporting the safety of food irradiation, consumers' acceptance of irradiated foods remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the development of food irradiation in China and identify the barriers that keep consumers away from irradiated foods. This was accomplished by exploring the relevant policies of food irradiation, the size and distribution of irradiation facilities in China, and analyzing their relationships between consumer characteristics and the acceptance of irradiated food. To achieve these objectives, we conducted an online survey of participants from Hubei, China (N = 264). The results reveal that irradiation facilities are mainly distributed in large coastal cities such as the Bohai Bay, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Greater Bay Area. Furthermore, the study identified that consumer' acceptance of irradiated food is directly related to their level of understanding. Approximately 22% of the sampled consumers reported that they would not accept that they have consumed irradiated food and most of them (41%) stated that they would not purchase irradiated food if they were aware of buying irradiated food. Specifically, consumers expressed discomfort with consuming irradiated food under unknown circumstances. This trend is more prevalent among female, low-educated, and older consumers, with 40% of the sampled population indicating that they would not buy irradiated food. Given the strong correlation between knowledge and acceptance of irradiated foods, the study suggests that policy reform should prioritize enhancing the understanding of irradiated food, particularly among female, low-educated, and older consumers.

As of January 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires hospitals to disclose payer-negotiated prices for services, offering new insight into prices for privately insured patients. Study DesignCross-sectional analysis. SettingTurquoise database. MethodsPayer-negotiated facility fees for 41 reconstructive surgeries were grouped by procedure type: primary closure, skin grafts, tissue rearrangement, locoregional flaps, or free flaps. Prices were normalized to account for local labor costs, then calculated as percent markup in excess of Medicare reimbursement. The mean percent markup between procedure groups was compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Subset analyses were performed to compare mean percent markup using a Student's t test. We also assessed price variation by calculating the ratio of 90th/10th percentile mean prices both across and within hospitals. ResultsIn total, 1324 hospitals (85% urban, 81% nonprofit, 49% teaching) were included. Median payer-negotiated fees showed an increasing trend with more complex procedures, ranging from $379.54 (interquartile range [IQR], $230.87-$656.96) for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 12001 ("simple repair of superficial wounds <= 2.5 cm") to $5422.60 ($3983.55-$8169.41) for CPT code 20969 ("free osteocutaneous flap with microvascular anastomosis"). Median percent markup was highest for primary closure procedures (576.17% [IQR, 326.28%-1089.34%]) and lowest for free flaps (99.56% [37.86%-194.02%]). Higher mean percent markups were observed for rural, for-profit, non-Northeast, nonteaching, and smaller hospitals. ConclusionWide variation in private payer-negotiated facility fees exists for head/neck reconstruction surgeries. Further research is necessary to better understand how pricing variation may correlate with out-of-pocket costs and quality of care.

BackgroundCathepsin S (CatS) is a cysteine protease and exerts important roles in the immune response. Elevated CatS has been found in the gingival tissues of periodontitis patients and is involved in alveolar bone destruction. However, the underlying mechanism of CatS-driven IL-6 production in periodontitis remains unclear. MethodsWestern blot was applied to measure mature cathepsin S(mCatS) and IL-6 expression in gingival tissues from periodontitis patients and RAW264.7 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g. LPS). Immunofluorescence was applied to confirm the localization of PU.1, and CatS in the gingival tissues of periodontitis patients. ELISA was performed to determine IL-6 production by the P.g. LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells. Knockdown by shRNA was used to determine the effects of PU.1 on p38/ nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B activation, mCatS expression and IL-6 production in RAW264.7 cells. ResultsThe expressions mCatS and IL-6 were significantly upregulated in gingival macrophages. In cultured RAW264.7 cells, increased mCatS and IL-6 protein paralleled the activation of p38 and NF-kappa B after exposure to P.g. LPS. CatS knockdown by shRNA significantly decreased P.g. LPS-induced IL-6 expression and p38/NF-kappa B activation. PU.1 was significantly increased in P.g. LPS-exposed RAW264.7 cells, and PU.1 knockdown dramatically abolished the P.g. LPS-induced upregulation of mCatS and IL-6 and the activation of p38 and NF-kappa B. Furthermore, PU.1 and CatS colocalized in macrophages within the gingival tissues of periodontitis patients. ConclusionPU.1-dependent CatS drives IL-6 production in macrophages by activating p38 and NF-kappa B in periodontitis.

Antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) might regulate the inflammatory responses mediated by nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. Beas-2B cells were used to clarify the role of ANRIL in the secretion of Muc5ac induced by PM2.5. The siRNA was used to silence ANRIL expression. Normal and gene silenced Beas-2B cells were respectively exposed to different doses of PM2.5 for 6, 12, and 24 h. The survival rate of Beas-2B cells was detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 ss (IL-1 ss) and Muc5ac levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of NF-kappa B family genes and ANRIL were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The levels of NF-kappa B family proteins and NF-kappa B family phosphorylated proteins were determined using Western blot. Immunofluorescence experiments were performed to observe the nuclear transposition of RelA. PM2.5 exposure increased the levels of Muc5ac, IL-1 ss and TNF-a, and ANRIL gene expression (p <.05). With the dose and time of PM2.5 exposure increasing, the protein levels of inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor kappa-B alpha (I.Ba), RelA, and NF-kappa B1 decreased, the protein levels of phosphorylated RelA (p-RelA) and phosphorylated NF-kappa B1 (p-NF-kappa B1) increased, and RelA nuclear translocation increased, which indicated that the NF-kappa B signaling pathway was activated (p <.05). Silencing ANRIL could decrease the levels of Muc5ac, IL-1 ss, TNF-a, decrease NF-.B family genes expression, inhibit the degradation of I.B-a and the activation of NF-.B pathway (p <.05). ANRIL played a regulatory role in the secretion of Muc5ac and the inflammation induced by atmospheric PM2.5 via NF-kappa B pathway in Beas-2B cells. ANRIL could be a target for prevention and treatment of the respiratory diseases caused by PM2.5.

In addition, gaze control is becoming a new option as an input device for the general population as well because of the increasing availability of eye-tracking technology. Yet, little is known about additional cognitive demands involved in gaze control and how to handle potentially high demands when using the eyes not only for perception but also for action. The present study shows that cognitive offloading improves performance when using gaze control. Memory for to-be-studied items benefitted significantly from saving another set of items just studied before for later restudy. Employing cognitive offloading in a targeted manner may be a useful means to assist in mastering eye-gaze control.

Since CNN is excellent in extracting texture features of images and transformer can learn the correlation among keypoints well, many CTPNets (CNN+transformer type human pose estimation networks) have emerged. However, these networks are unconcerned with the processing of the features extracted from the CNN and naturally expand only from the channel dimension, ignoring the spatial features in the visual information that are essential for complex detection tasks like pose estimation. So the channel spatial integrated transformer for human pose estimation, termed CSIT, is proposed. The visual information are summarized as texture and spatial information, and a parallel network is used to expand the feature maps in the channel and spatial dimensions to learn texture features and spatial features respectively. In addition, anatomically constrained information is learned by keypoint embeddings. At the end of the network, the 1D vector representation method with more advanced performance and more compatible with transformer's characteristics is used to predict keypoints. Experiments show that CSIT outperforms the mainstream CTPNets on the COCO test-dev dataset, and also show satisfactory results on the MPII dataset.

Optimization of acquisition parameters for cortical inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) imaging using a rapid gradient echo readout	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						cerebral cortex; dipolar order; ihMT; magnetization transfer; myelin	BROADENED LINES; RELAXATION; WATER; SYSTEMS	PurposeImaging biomarkers with increased myelin specificity are needed to better understand the complex progression of neurological disorders. Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) imaging is an emergent technique that has a high degree of specificity for myelin content but suffers from low signal to-noise ratio (SNR). This study used simulations to determine optimal sequence parameters for ihMT imaging for use in high-resolution cortical mapping.MethodsMT-weighted cortical image intensity and ihMT SNR were simulated using modified Bloch equations for a range of sequence parameters. The acquisition time was limited to 4.5 min/volume. A custom MT-weighted RAGE sequence with center-out k-space encoding was used to enhance SNR at 3 T. Pulsed MT imaging was studied over a range of saturation parameters, and the impact of the turbo factor on the effective ihMT resolution was investigated. 1 mm isotropic ihMT(sat) maps were generated in 25 healthy adults.ResultsGreater SNR was observed for larger number of bursts consisting of 6-8 saturation pulses each, combined with a high readout turbo factor. However, that protocol suffered from a point spread function that was more than twice the nominal resolution. For high-resolution cortical imaging, we selected a protocol with a higher effective resolution at the cost of a lower SNR. We present the first group-average ihMT(sat) whole-brain map at 1 mm isotropic resolution.ConclusionThis study presents the impact of saturation and excitation parameters on ihMT(sat) SNR and resolution. We demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution cortical myelin imaging using ihMT(sat) in less than 20 min.	[Rowley, Christopher D. D.; Campbell, Jennifer S. W.; Leppert, Ilana R.

Morphologic impact of four surgical techniques to correct excessive tibial plateau angle in dogs: A theoretical radiographic analysis	VETERINARY SURGERY			English	Article; Early Access							CRUCIATE LIGAMENT DISEASE; CLOSING WEDGE OSTEOTOMY; LEVELING OSTEOTOMY; DEFICIENT STIFLES; TUBEROSITY FRACTURE; POSITION; SUBLUXATION; OSTECTOMY; INJURY	ObjectiveTo determine morphologic differences between four tibial osteotomy techniques used to correct excessive tibial plateau angle (eTPA). Study designRetrospective radiographic analysis. Sample populationSixteen dogs (27 tibias) with eTPA. MethodsVirtual corrections of eTPA were performed on sagittal plane radiographs of canine tibia using four tibial osteotomy techniques and categorized into respective groups. Group A represented the center of rotation of angulation (CORA)-based leveling osteotomy (CBLO) and coplanar cranial closing wedge ostectomy (CCWO), Group B the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) and CCWO, Group C the modified CCWO (mCCWO), and Group D the proximal tibial neutral wedge osteotomy (PTNWO). Pre- and post-correction TPA, tibial length and mechanical cranial distal tibial angle (mCrDTA) were measured and compared. ResultsMean TPA prior to correction was 42.67 +/- 6.1 degrees. Post-correction mean TPAs were 10.47 +/- 2.1 degrees, 6.77 +/- 1.6 degrees, 4.76 +/- 1.5 degrees, and 7.09 +/- 1.3 degrees for Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. TPA correction accuracy in Groups A and D varied least from target TPAs. Tibial shortening was documented in Group B in contrast to other groups. The greatest mechanical axis shift was identified in Group A. ConclusionEach technique achieved TPA < 14 degrees despite having different effects on tibial morphology including alteration of tibial length, mechanical axis shift and variation in correctional accuracy. Clinical significanceDespite all methods being able to correct eTPA, the choice of technique will affect morphology in unique ways and should be considered prior to surgery to consider the implications in a given patient.

A facile methodology is introduced to tune the triplet state dynamics of a phosphorescent molecule by changing the host-matrix parameters. An organic phosphor, Br2PmDI (2-Bromo pyromellitic diimide), dispersed at dilute levels (1.5 wt.%) in a semicrystalline high-kappa relaxer ferroelectric host matrix emit room-temperature phosphorescence accompanied by a delayed fluorescence component. The host relaxer ferroelectric polymer film can be engineered to form a photonic matrix with a regular micropore structure of refractive index contrast approximate to 0.6 that can increase the density of optical states and introduce photonic coupling. The phosphorescence quantum yield of Br2PmDI in this photonic matrix increases by approximate to 2.3 fold, and the lifetime reduces by a factor of three. The coupled quantum states are investigated by time-resolved spectroscopy at different temperatures and pump intensities.	[Behera, Sinay Simanta; Ghorai, Anaranya; Narayan, K.

J	de Vargas, VH; Marczak, LDF; Flores, SH; Mercali, GD				de Vargas, Victoria Hermes; Marczak, Ligia Damasceno Ferreira; Flores, Simone Hickmann; Mercali, Giovana Domeneghini			Morphology and functional properties of gelatin-based films modified by UV radiation and bacterial cellulose nanofibers	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING			English	Article						biodegradable films; emerging technology; gelatin; nanomaterials; packaging	ACTIVE BIODEGRADABLE FILMS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; COMPOSITE FILMS; SKIN GELATIN; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; WATER SOLUBILITY; PROTEIN FILMS; STARCH FILMS; IRRADIATION	In the present study, the properties of biodegradable gelatin-based films were modified by UV treatment and the incorporation of 1% (w/w) of bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers. UVC light was applied at different exposure times (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h) into the film-forming solutions. In order to evaluate the synergistic effects of these two treatments, the optimal UV condition was also applied to BC-reinforced solutions. Films were characterized by their physicochemical, mechanical, barrier, optical, thermal, and morphological properties. Results showed that the UV treatment applied for 2 h significantly reduced the water solubility (WS) but did not affect the water vapor permeability (WVP). On the other hand, the incorporation of BC reduced WS and WVP values by 15% and 43%, respectively. Regarding mechanical properties, both treatments significantly reduced film elongation at break. However, the tensile strength (TS) and Young's modulus (YM) were only affected by UV treatment. For the film exposed to the longest treatment time, TS increased from 1.56 MPa (control) to 2.85 MPa, and YM increased from 4.36 MPa (control) to 9.23 MPa. Overall, SEM results showed that all samples had a uniform surface and a cohesive matrix. However, BC-reinforced films showed some additional clusters, which significantly increased opacity values. Regardless of their composition, all gelatin-based films lost their integrity after a 12-day soil burial experiment. Film thickness, moisture content, and color parameters were not affected by any treatment. Furthermore, no synergistic effects were detected.Practical applicationsBiopolymer films and coatings are promising systems to ensure shelf life, quality, and food safety, representing a sustainable alternative to replace traditional petroleum-based materials. Although these films have advantages, mainly due to their biodegradability, their properties are not competitive at an industrial level and need to be improved. Therefore, several studies have investigated the application of physical treatments and new process methodologies to overcome these limitations. The present study evaluated the potential use of UV radiation and bacterial cellulose nanofibers in the development of gelatin-based films. Overall, the results showed that these methods are capable of modifying the properties and structure of films, thus offering an alternative to conventional methods of film production. Mastering the use of advanced technologies for film development could be the key to tailoring biopolymer films and coatings for specific industrial applications.

Recently, a local pharmaceutical company produced esomeprazole magnesium enteric-coated capsules, a major drug to help to eradicate Helicobacter pylori, but the bioequivalence is not well known. The present study aimed to evaluate the bioequivalence of the 2 esomeprazole magnesium enteric-coated capsules and their pharmacokinetics and safety in 3 biological equivalence trials: fasting, feeding, and mixing. The fasting and mixing trials used single-centered randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period, and 2-sequence crossover design, while the fed trials used single-centered, randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-treatment, 3-period, 3-sequence partial crossover design. For the fasting and mixing trials, each of the 32 subjects was fasted overnight prior to taking the test preparations or reference preparations. In the fed trial, 54 subjects were given a high-fat meal 1 hour before the drugs were administered. Blood specimens from all subjects were collected against the light within 14 hours, with the plasma drug concentration being detected by the validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis method. Geometric mean ratio of maximum concentration, the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration, and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity with 90% confidence interval were calculated. The data from fasting, mixing, and fed trials met the bioequivalence criteria. No serious adverse reactions were found, suggesting that the test and reference preparations of esomeprazole magnesium enteric capsules have similar safety profile.

The study of Wigner negativity and its evolution under different quantum channels can provide insight into the stability and robustness of quantum states under their interaction with the environment, which is essential for developing practical quantum computing systems. The variation of DWF negativity of qubit, qutrit, and two-qubit systems under the action of (non)-Markovian random telegraph noise (RTN) and amplitude damping (AD) quantum channels is investigated. Different negative quantum states that can be used as a resource for quantum computation and quantum teleportation are constructed. The success of quantum computation and teleportation is estimated for these states under (non)-Markovian evolutions.	[Lalita, Jai; Paulson, K.

A Photo-Thermoelectric Twist to Wireless Energy Transfer: Radial Flexible Thermoelectric Device Powered by a High-Power Laser Beam	ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Early Access						high-power lasers; screen printing; space exploration; thermoelectric devices; wireless energy transfers	FLUORIDE COMPOSITE; FILM; GENERATOR; PERFORMANCE; POLYIMIDE; SENSOR	Systems for wireless energy transmission (WET) are gaining prominence nowadays. This work presents a WET system based on the photo-thermoelectric effect. With an incident laser beam at lambda = 1450 nm, a temperature gradient is generated in the radial flexible thermoelectric (TE) device, with a carbon-based light collector in its center to enhance the photoheating. The three-part prototype presents a unique approach by using a radial TE device with one simple manufacturing process - screen-printing. A TE ink with a polymeric matrix of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate and doped-Poly(vinyl alcohol) with Sb-Bi-Te microparticles is developed (S similar to 33 mu VK-1 and s similar to 10.31 Sm-1), presenting mechanical and electrical stability. Regarding the device, a full electrical analysis is performed, and the influence of the light collector is investigated using thermal tests, spectrophotometry, and numerical simulations. A maximum output voltage (Vout) of similar to 16 mV and maximum power density of similar to 25 mu Wm(-2) are achieved with Plaser = 2 W. Moreover, the device's viability under extreme conditions is explored. At T similar to 180 K, a 25% increase in Vout compared to room-temperature conditions is achieved, and at low pressures (similar to 10(-6) Torr), an increase of 230% is obtained. Overall, this prototype allows the supply of energy at long distances and remote places, especially for space exploration.	[Maia, Margarida; Pires, Ana L.

MethodsThe longitudinal version of the K-means algorithm was applied to the outcome measures data of 74 patients treated in four public mental health centers. The patients were measured five times at 6-month intervals for three outcome measures. ResultsFor the OQ45 and Symptom Checklist-90, one trajectory was marked by a lower initial distress level. In this trajectory, the improvement occurred in the first half of the measurements, with a plateau thereafter. A second trajectory was characterized by higher initial severity and an improvement, mainly in the second part of the measurements. For the Beck Depression Inventory, one trajectory was marked by lower initial distress. In this group, the improvement occurred throughout the entire period. The remaining patients were characterized by higher initial distress and a decreased level of distress in the last part of treatment. They began to improve only during the third year of therapy. ConclusionThe response to treatment is not uniform in long-term treatment for highly challenging patients. A significant number of patients require a longer period of therapy to ignite improvement.

However, the subsequent 90-day storage softened the initial effect of HPP on microorganisms and allowed a significant effect of HPP to develop on color and oxidation. In addition, the coliform counts were higher after storage at 20?than at 4?, suggesting that refrigeration may be needed during long-term storage to ensure loin safety.

Its clinical potential has been demonstrated in several applications, but lack of evidence on optimal parameters limits clinical utility of the technique. This study aimed to identify optimal parameters for rt-fMRI-NF-aided craving regulation training in alcohol use disorder (AUD). Adults with AUD (n = 30) participated in a single-session study of four runs of rt-fMRI-NF where they downregulated "craving-related" brain activity. They received one of three types of neurofeedback: multi-region of interest (ROI), support vector machine with continuous feedback (cSVM), and support vector machine with intermittent feedback (iSVM). Performance was assessed on the success rate, change in neural downregulation, and change in self-reported craving for alcohol. Participants had more successful trials in run 4 versus 1, as well as improved downregulation of the insula, anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Greater downregulation of the latter two regions predicted greater reduction in craving. iSVM performed significantly worse than the other two methods. Downregulation of the striatum and dlPFC, enabled by ROI but not cSVM neurofeedback, was correlated with a greater reduction in craving. rt-fMRI-NF training for downregulation of alcohol craving in individuals with AUD shows potential for clinical use, though this pilot study should be followed with a larger randomized-control trial before clinical meaningfulness can be established. Preliminary results suggest an advantage of multi-ROI over SVM and intermittent feedback approaches.

After the vacuum heat treatment process, a diffusion layer is formed at the interface between the Cu coating and the Ti-6Al-4V substrate. The formed intermetallic compounds at the interface between the Ti-6Al-4V substrate and Cu coating are CuTi2, CuTi, Cu4Ti3, and beta-Cu4Ti. The activation energy of intermetallic compound growth in the diffusion zone of Cu-coated Ti-6Al-4V is 126.0 kJ mol(-1), and the pre-exponential factor is 0.1 m(2) s(-1). The tribological properties of the Cu-coated Ti-6Al-4V alloy are best when subjected to diffusion treatment at 700 degrees C for 300 min, with weight loss reduced by 58.2% compared to the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The wear resistance of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy can be enhanced by Cu coating and vacuum diffusion heat treatment, and the formation of the Cu-Ti intermetallic compound contributes to this improvement. These findings offer new insights for further advancements in the tribological properties of titanium alloys.

Despite the large number of studies on the properties of perovskite single-crystals (SCs) photodetectors (PDs), the underlying mechanism that governs the spectral line shape of transient photocurrent is not fully understood. Here, methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr(3))SC based PDs are used to study the effect of different electrode spacing and bias on the transient photocurrent response under blue and green light irradiation. The observed differences in the spectral line shape of the transient photocurrent are explained using three-step carrier transport model, which reveals the occurrence of carrier trapping and a recombination process in MAPbBr(3) SC. The findings are further corroborated by intensity-dependent photocurrent and impedance spectroscopy analysis of the resulting PDs. This work provides a basic insight into the origin of the different behavior of transient photocurrent response under variable electrode distance, bias, and irradiance light, which is expected to help to further understand and optimize the performance of perovskite based PDs.

Using a new historical database, I track changes in maternity leave provisions in 160 countries between 1883 and 2018 in the light of the International Labour Conference's adoption of the Maternity Protection Conventions. The empirical findings confirm that both non-ratifying and ratifying States expanded the terms and conditions of their paid maternity leave policies shortly thereafter.

About 10% of cases are classified as hereditary melanoma (HM). CDKN2A and CDK4 are the major high-risk genes. Families are also more prone to develop pancreatic cancer, and different forms of oncological surveillance are recommended. Objectives Describe the prevalence of CDKN2A/CDK4 germline mutations in melanomaprone patients and their phenotypic and histopathological features. Methods A total of 69 patients meeting the clinical criteria for HM were included in this cross-sectional descriptive study. Amplification by PCR and genomic sequencing were used. The variants were classified according to American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria. Results The mean age at first diagnosis of melanoma was 44.8 years (SD +/- 17.83). Most patients had phototype II (44.9%), more than 50 melanocytic nevi (76.8%), atypical nevus syndrome (72.5%), history of sunburn (76.8%), and multiple primary melanomas without a family history of this tumor (74.3%). Two hundred melanomas were observed. Most tumors had a Breslow index <= 1.0 mm (84.5%), location in the trunk (60.5%), and superficial spreading histological subtype (22.5%). Four variants were found in CDKN2A exons in seven patients (c.305C>A, c.26T>A, c.361G>A e c.442G>A), two variants in the 50 UTR region in five patients (c.-25C>T and c.-33G>C), and two variants in the 30 UTR region in 21 patients (c.*29C>G and c.*69C>T). One likely pathogenic variant (c.305C>A) was identified in one patient (1.4%). No variant was found in CDK4. Conclusion The prevalence of CDKN2A mutations was 1.4% in Brazilian patients meeting clinical criteria for HM.	[Arnaut, Joyce R. M.

Restless sleep disorder in children with epileptic and non-epileptic nocturnal attacks	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						cyclic alternating pattern; epileptic nocturnal attacks; large muscle movements; NREM parasomnias; restless sleep disorder	DISTURBANCE	Restless sleep disorder (RSD) is an important sleep disorder characterised by the presence of frequent large muscle movements (LMM) during sleep, which may be comorbid to other conditions/diseases. In this study, we investigated the frequency and the characteristics of RSD among children who were evaluated by polysomnography (PSG) due to epileptic and non-epileptic nocturnal attacks. We analysed consecutively children younger than 18 years who were referred for PSG recording due to abnormal motor activities during sleep. The diagnosis of nocturnal events as sleep-related epilepsy was made based on the current consensus. Patients who were referred with suspicion of sleep-related epilepsy, but who were diagnosed to have non-epileptic nocturnal events and children with a definitive diagnosis of NREM sleep parasomnias were also enrolled. Sixty-two children were analysed in this study (17 children with sleep-related epilepsy, 20 children with NREM parasomnia, and 25 children with nocturnal events not otherwise classified [neNOS]). The mean number of LMM, LMM index, LMM-associated with arousal and its index were all significantly higher in children with sleep-related epilepsy. Restless sleep disorder was present in 47.1% of patients with epilepsy, 25% of patients with parasomnia, and in 20% of patients with neNOS. The mean A3 duration and the A3 index were higher in children with sleep-related epilepsy and RSD compared with those with parasomnia and restless sleep disorder. Patients with RSD had lower ferritin levels than those without RSD in all subgroups. Our study demonstrates a high prevalence of restless sleep disorder in children with sleep-related epilepsy, associated with an increased cyclic alternating pattern.

Coral-associated bacteria affect holobiont health via nutrient cycling, metabolic exchanges and pathogen exclusion, yet it is not fully understood how bacterial community shifts affect holobiont health and physiology. In this study, a combination of antibiotics (ampicillin, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin) was used to disrupt the bacterial communities of 14 colonies of the reef framework-building corals Pocillopora meandrina and P. verrucosa, originally collected from Panama and hosting diverse algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae). Symbiodiniaceae photochemical efficiencies and holobiont oxygen consumption (as proxies for coral health) were measured throughout a 5-day exposure. Antibiotics altered bacterial community composition and reduced alpha and beta diversity, however, several bacteria persisted, leading to the hypothesis that these bacteria are either antibiotics resistant or occupy internal niches that are shielded from antibiotics. While antibiotics did not affect Symbiodiniaceae photochemical efficiency, antibiotics-treated corals had lower oxygen consumption rates. RNAseq revealed that antibiotics increased expression of Pocillopora immunity and stress response genes at the expense of cellular maintenance and metabolism functions. Together, these results reveal that antibiotic disruption of corals' native bacteria negatively impacts holobiont health by decreasing oxygen consumption and activating host immunity without directly impairing Symbiodiniaceae photosynthesis, underscoring the critical role of coral-associated bacteria in holobiont health. They also provide a baseline for future experiments that manipulate Pocillopora corals' symbioses by first reducing the diversity and complexity of coral-associated bacteria.
