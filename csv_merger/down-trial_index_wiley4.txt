In this study, some nanocomposite nanofilter membranes, as a promising solution for this goal, were fabricated by incorporation of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets into polyethersulfone (PES) membrane matrix and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) via the method of non-solvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) to dedicate them higher separation performance and a higher antifouling tendency. The produced GO nanosheets and the prepared membranes' structure were evaluated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Then, the separation performance and antifouling characteristics of the prepared pristine and nanocomposite membranes were evaluated at 3 bar, 27 degrees C, and Congo red (CR) dye concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 ppm. The observations revealed that the incorporation of GO nanosheets into the polymer matrix of PES-PVP increases the permeation flux, rejection of CR, and flux recovery ratio (FRR) to the maximum values of 276.4 L/m(2).h, 99.5%, and 92.4%, respectively, at 0.4 wt.% loading of GO nanosheets as an optimum filler loading. Practitioner Points Graphene oxide nanosheets were prepared and uniformly incorporated in the polyethersulfone porous membrane.The nanocomposite membranes revealed higher separation performance, that is, permeation flux and dye rejection as 282.5 L/m(2).h and 99.5% at 0.4 wt.% loading of GO nanosheets.Flux recovery ratio of the nanocomposite membrane, as their antifouling character, also increased as 92.4%, as the GO nanosheets were incorporated by 0.4 wt.%.

Less, however, is understood about the potential benefits and efficacy of day-to-day routine access to outdoor green and blue spaces for mental health service users. Methods: Using a mixed-methods design between April and October 2021, we explored the benefits and barriers to spending time outdoors with a purposive sample of mental health service users (N = 11) using qualitative interviews and an online general population survey (N = 1791). Qualitative evidence highlighted the restorative benefits of nature and identified a number of barriers associated with fears around personal safety, social anxiety, fatigue and lack of motivation. COVID-19 had also restricted access to green and blue spaces. Having social contact and support encouraged people to spend time outdoors. In the quantitative survey, self-report and standardised measures (the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Warwick-Edinburgh Wellbeing Scale) were used to assess past and current mental wellbeing. Findings: Statistically significant differences were found between wellbeing and the use of green and blue spaces. Those with mental health problems spent time outdoors because they: felt guilty; wanted to reduce their anxiety; or rely on someone for encouragement. Those without mental health problems endorsed more positively framed reasons including relaxation, improving physical health or getting exercise. Barriers for people with mental health problems involved safety concerns, feeling anxious and having a poor self-image. These findings give insight into motivations for an outdoor activity to help inform the design of public mental health interventions. Conclusion: Further work is required to improve access and safety to promote the benefits of green and blue spaces for everyone. Patient or Public Contribution: The research team included expert experienced researchers with a mental health service provider (Praxis Care) and they were involved in the development of the research idea, funding application, design, data collection, analysis, writing up and dissemination activities.

Khademi			Variational Pose Prediction with Dynamic Sample Selection from Sparse Tracking Signals	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article								We propose a learning-based approach for full-body pose reconstruction from extremely sparse upper body tracking data, obtained from a virtual reality (VR) device. We leverage a conditional variational autoencoder with gated recurrent units to synthesize plausible and temporally coherent motions from 4-point tracking (head, hands, and waist positions and orientations). To avoid synthesizing implausible poses, we propose a novel sample selection and interpolation strategy along with an anomaly detection algorithm. Specifically, we monitor the quality of our generated poses using the anomaly detection algorithm and smoothly transition to better samples when the quality falls below a statistically defined threshold. Moreover, we demonstrate that our sample selection and interpolation method can be used for other applications, such as target hitting and collision avoidance, where the generated motions should adhere to the constraints of the virtual environment. Our system is lightweight, operates in real-time, and is able to produce temporally coherent and realistic motions.	[Milef, N.; Sueda, S.; Kalantari, N.

However, clinical application requires in vitro cell manufacturing to attain enough cells. Unfortunately, this process often drives MSCs into a senescent state that drastically changes cellular secretion activities. Antioxidants are used to reverse and prevent the propagation of senescence; however, their activity is short-lived. Polymer-stabilized crystallization of antioxidants has been shown to improve bioactivity, but the broad crystal size distribution (CSD) significantly increases the efficacy variation. Efforts are made to crystalize drugs in microdroplets to narrow the CSD, but the fraction of drops containing at least one crystal can be as low as 20%. To this end, this study demonstrates that in-drop thermal cycling of hyaluronic acid-modified antioxidant crystals, named microcrystal assembly for senescence control (MASC), can drive the fraction of microdrops containing crystals to >86% while achieving significantly narrower CSDs (13 +/- 3 mu m) than in bulk (35 +/- 11 mu m). Therefore, this approach considerably improves the practicality of CSD-control in drops. In addition to exhibiting uniform release, MASC made with antioxidizing N-acetylcysteine extends the release time by 40%. MASC further improves the restoration of reactive oxygen species homeostasis in MSCs, thus minimizing cellular senescence and preserving desired secretion activities. It is proposed that MASC is broadly useful to controlling senescence of a wide array of therapeutic cells during biomanufacturing.

Understanding the most common carcinogenic molecular pathways that affect Hispanics with CRC is crucial to guide research efforts in developing new therapeutic modalities incorporating genomically diverse populations. Tumor profiling techniques help identify actionable alternatives to recommend treatment and improve survival in cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis to evaluate the mutational profile of 218 CRC tumors in Hispanics living in Puerto Rico (PRH) who underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing from 2015 to 2020. We compared the prevalence of CRC tumor somatic mutations in PRHs with the mutational profiles reported for CRC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Clinical Data, the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE)-Non-Hispanic, and GENIE-Hispanic datasets. Results: Among the top mutated genes in CRC tumors in PRHs were APC, TP53, and KRAS, which had significantly higher mutational frequencies in PRH compared to the examined datasets, including GENIE-Hispanics. The most frequent gene amplifications for PRH were CDX2, CDKN1B, and HNRNPA2B1. Targetable biomarkers for CRC, such as microsatellite instability-high (MSI), wild-type KRAS, wild-type NRAS, V600E BRAF, and ERBB2 gene amplifications were found in 2.0%, 43.8%, 97.8%, 3.9%, and 2.3%, respectively, of PRH patients. Conclusion: This is the first study to report the mutational profile of CRC tumors in PRHs and make comparisons to other non-Hispanic and USH populations.	[Montes-Rodriguez, Ingrid M.

A high index of suspicion for an acute and traumatic ilio-vesical fistula should be raised in the presence of the following triad: bright red hematuria, bladder distension from clot retention, hemodynamic instability after bladder decompression "Mukendi's triad." Iliac artery injury from gunshot wounds is very rare and a lethal injury associated with high mortality rate. Concurrent ballistic external iliac artery and bladder injuries resulting in an acute ilio-vesical shunt or fistula and discovered at the time of presentation are extremely rare.In this report, we present an unprecedented case of multiple pelvic gunshot wounds presented with a distended injured bladder full of clots concealing a left external iliac injury by tamponade effect.

This study assessed the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of nasal symptom score (NSS), non-nasal symptom score (NNSS), and total symptoms score (TSS) for app-based hay-fever monitoring. MethodsMCIDs were calculated based on the data from a previous large-scale, crowdsourced, cross-sectional study using AllerSearch, an in-house smartphone application. MCIDs were determined with anchor-based and distribution-based methods. The face scale score of the Japanese Allergic Conjunctival Disease Standard Quality of Life Questionnaire Domain III and the daily stress level due to hay fever were used as anchors for determining MCIDs. The MCID estimates were summarized as MCID ranges. ResultsA total of 7590 participants were included in the analysis (mean age: 35.3 years, 57.1% women). The anchor-based method produced a range of MCID values (median, interquartile range) for NSS (2.0, 1.5-2.1), NNSS (1.0, 0.9-1.2), and TSS (2.9, 2.4-3.3). The distribution-based method produced two MCIDs (based on half a standard deviation, based on a standard error of measurement) for NSS (2.0, 1.8), NNSS (1.3, 1.2), and TSS (3.0, 2.3). The final suggested MCID ranges for NSS, NNSS, and TSS were 1.8-2.1, 1.2-1.3, and 2.4-3.3, respectively.

Physical examination abnormalities included hypothermia, dehydration, and generalized paresis with inability to stand for a prolonged period of time. Abdominal ultrasonography showed pinpoint hyperechoic foci throughout the hepatic parenchyma, small gas foci circulating within the portal vasculature consistent with emphysematous hepatitis, and mild volume of ascites. Cytology of the ascites was consistent with inflammatory effusion. Hepatic cytology was consistent with mixed inflammation/hepatitis with no apparent cause for inflammation noted. Urine culture yielded a negative result. Surgical liver biopsy and culture were declined by the patient's family. Ultrasound changes were presumed to be most likely secondary to an ascending infection.

Angiosarcoma is a rare, fatal, and poorly understood malignant tumor of vascular endothelial cells which is a challenging disease to diagnose in the clinical settings and requires early diagnosis to achieve a favorable prognosis. Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with angiosarcoma can include hypercoagulability, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fever, weight loss, and night sweats. In some cases, the paraneoplastic syndrome can be the first sign of the underlying malignancy. Here, we present a 47-year-old individual with angiosarcoma over the right scapula accompanied by hemoptysis and other pulmonary complaints whom at first was thought to be metastatic polmunary involvement. However, the patient's dramatic response to corticosteroids, in addition to further imaging and paraclinical studies, led us to an acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) diagnosis which is an eosinophilic infiltrations of alveolar spaces. The patient received chemotherapy for angiosarcoma and radiation, since the brachial nerve network was disrupted, leaving the tumor unresectable. After 3 years of continuous follow-up, the patient is now completely cured.

Here, we examined the composition of Sri Lankan chafer assemblages and investigated whether it is influenced more by the general ecoclimatic situation, macrohabitat, or indetermined stochastic biotic and abiotic factors of each locality. We also explored the influence of the latter on separate lineages and general body size. Based on dedicated field surveys conducted during the dry and wet seasons, we examined 4847 chafer individuals of 105 species sampled using multiple UV-light traps in 11 localities covering different forest types and altitudinal zones. Assemblages were assessed for compositional similarity, species diversity, and abundance within four major eco-spatial partitions: forest types, elevational zones, localities, and macrohabitats. Our results revealed that assemblages were shaped mainly by locality stochastics (i.e., multi-factor ensemble of all biotic and abiotic environmental conditions at local scale), and to a minor extent by ecoclimatic conditions. Macrohabitat had little effect on the assemblage composition. This was true for the entire chafer assemblage as well as for all single lineages or different body size classes. However, in medium and large species the contrasts between localities were less pronounced, which was not the case for individual lineages of the assemblage. Contrasts of assemblage similarity between localities were much more evident than those for forest types and elevation zones. Significant correlation between species composition and geographic distance was found only for the assemblage of small-bodied specimens. Seasonal change (dry-wet) in species composition was minor and only measurable in a few localities. The strong turnover between examined localities corroborates with the high degree of endemism in many phytophagous chafers, particularly in Sericini. Connected with their hypothetic poor habitat specificity and polyphagy, this might also explain why so many chafer crop pests in the Asian tropics are endemics.	[Ranasinghe, U. G.

Optically-Boosted Planar IBC Solar Cells with Electrically-Harmless Photonic Nanocoatings	ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						crystalline silicon solar cells; light management; photonic nanostructured coatings; photovoltaics	NANOSTRUCTURES; FABRICATION; PERFORMANCE; ABSORPTION; TRANSPORT; DESIGN; TIO2	Advanced light management via front-coated photonic nanostructures is a promising strategy to enhance photovoltaic (PV) efficiency through wave-optical light-trapping (LT) effects, avoiding the conventional texturing processes that induce the degradation of electrical performance due to increased carrier recombination. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) honeycomb arrays with different geometry are engineered through a highly-scalable colloidal lithography method on flat crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers and tested on standard planar c-Si interdigitated back-contact solar cells (pIBCSCs). The photonic-structured wafers achieve an optical photocurrent of 36.6 mA cm(-2), mainly due to a broad anti-reflection effect from the 693 nm thick nanostructured coatings. In contrast, the pIBCSC test devices reach 14% efficiency with 679 nm thick TiO2 nanostructures, corresponding to a approximate to 30% efficiency gain relative to uncoated pIBCSCs. In addition, several designed structures show unmatched angular acceptance enhancements in efficiency (up to 63% gain) and photocurrent density (up to 68% gain). The high-performing (yet electrically harmless) LT scheme, here presented, entails an up-and-coming alternative to conventional texturing for c-Si technological improvement that can be straightforwardly integrated into the established PV industry.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional cytokine that has been heavily linked with cervical cancer. Our aim was to investigate the association of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-6 (rs1800795 and rs1800797) with the susceptibility of cervical cancer in Bangladeshi women. MethodsDNA was extracted from venous blood samples from cervical cancer patients (n = 126) and healthy controls (n = 120). Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used for genotyping of the selected SNPs. Logistic regression was performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p values. ResultsWe found a significant association between rs1800795 and rs1800797 polymorphisms and cervical cancer. For, rs1800795 (G > C) the GC heterozygous genotype (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.55-5.07, p = 0.0007) and CC mutant homozygous genotype (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.29-9.51, p = 0.014) conferred an increased risk of cervical cancer. In case of rs1800797 (G > A) polymorphism, the AG heterozygous genotype (OR = 6.94, 95% CI = 3.76-12.81, p < 0.0001) and AA mutant homozygous genotype (OR = 3.88, 95% CI = 1.12-13.51, p = 0.0332) also exhibited an elevated risk of cervical cancer. Use of contraceptives was found as risk factor and patients who smoke were carriers of both the risk alleles and thus had an increased risk of cervical cancer. ConclusionOur findings suggest that polymorphism of rs1800795 and rs1800797 of the IL-6 gene play a significant role in cervical cancer susceptibility in Bangladeshi women.

We aimed to investigate this association in women with intact anal sphincter presenting with pelvic floor dysfunction. MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed 1133 women with intact anal sphincter presenting to a tertiary urogynecological center for pelvic floor dysfunction between 2014 and 2016. All women underwent a standardized interview, including assessment of symptoms of AI, clinical examination and three-/four-dimensional transperineal ultrasound. Descent of the rectal ampulla, true rectocele, enterocele, intussusception and anal sphincter trauma were diagnosed offline. ResultsMean age was 54.1 (range, 17.6-89.7) years and mean body mass index was 29.4 (range, 14.7-67.8) kg/m(2). AI was reported by 149 (13%) patients, with a median St Mark's anal incontinence score of 12 (interquartile range, 1-23). Significant posterior compartment prolapse was seen in 693 (61%) women on clinical examination. Overall, 638 (56%) women had posterior compartment prolapse on imaging: 527 (47%) had a true rectocele, 89 (7.9%) had an enterocele and 26 (2.3%) had an intussusception. Women with ultrasound-diagnosed enterocele had a significantly higher rate of AI (23.6% vs 12.3%; odds ratio (OR), 2.21 (95% CI, 1.31-3.72); P = 0.002), but when adjusted for potential confounders, this association was no longer significant (OR, 1.56 (95% CI, 0.82-2.77); P = 0.134). ConclusionIn women without anal sphincter trauma, posterior compartment prolapse, whether diagnosed clinically or by imaging, was not shown to be associated with AI.

MethodsDuring SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant circulation between October 2021 and April 2022, prospectively enrolled adult patients with outpatient ARI had respiratory and filter paper blood specimens collected for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing and serology. Dried blood spots were tested for immunoglobulin-G antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain antigen using a validated multiplex bead assay. Evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection also included documented or self-reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We used documented COVID-19 vaccination status to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) by multivariable logistic regression by prior infection status. ResultsFour hundred fifty-five (29%) of 1577 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at enrollment; 209 (46%) case-patients and 637 (57%) test-negative patients were NP seropositive, had documented previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, or self-reported prior infection. Among previously uninfected patients, three-dose VE was 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 60%-99%) against Delta, but not statistically significant against Omicron. Among previously infected patients, three-dose VE was 57% (CI, 20%-76%) against Omicron; VE against Delta could not be estimated. ConclusionsThree mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses provided additional protection against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant-associated illness among previously infected participants.

J	Vernon, E				Vernon, Evie			A Jamaican Response to the Call to Act Together "For the Love of Christ Urges Us On" (2 Cor. 5:14)	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MISSION			English	Article						reparations; repentance; LGBTQ; residential schools; sexual abuse		This article is an exploration of following the way of Jesus regarding apologies and restitution for slavery. Three stories of good practice from the North American Jesuits, the United Reformed Church, and the Church of England are contrasted with stories of the abuse of children from First Nations people in Canada, poor families in Ireland, and the transportation of allegedly indigent children from Britain to Australia. These accounts are used to examine critically how far the church is following the call of Jesus to care for the vulnerable and identify with the marginalized in interactions with those sexually abused in churches, in engagement with sex workers, and the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community. A poetic reflection from the voice of the man who lived outside his community of the Gadarenes concludes the article.				evie.vernon@gmail.com							23	0	0	0	0	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0020-8582	1758-6631		INT REV MISSION	Int.

Herein, a hierarchical nitrogen-doped carbon nanocage (hNCNC) is introduced as a second near-infrared photothermal agent, and then functionalizes it with metal-organic hydrogel (MOG) to form a thermal-responsive switch for sensitized photothermal therapy. Upon 1064 nm light irradiation, the hNCNCs exhibit a remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency of 65.9% owing to a high near-infrared extinction coefficient. Meanwhile, due to the hierarchical structure, hNCNCs show 60.2% (wt./wt.) loading efficiency of quercetin, a heat shock protein (Hsp70) inhibitor. Through thermal-driven dry-gel transformation, the coating MOGs intelligently release the encapsulated quercetin for sensitizing cancer cells to heat. Based on the synergistic effect of hyperthermia elevation and thermal-driven drug release, the dual thermal utilization platform achieves effective photothermal tumor ablation in vivo under low concentration of hNCNCs and mild irradiation, which provides a new diagram of intelligent responsive photothermal agents for enhanced photothermal therapy.

Yet, it is a significant challenge to modulate the metal-support interaction (MSI) for enhancing catalytic performance. Herein, employing a facile HF etching method, the cation vacancy structures in Ti3C2Tx MXenes are controllably tuned, producing nearly vacancy-free (Ti3C2Tx-V-0), single Ti atom vacancy (Ti3C2Tx-V-S), or Ti vacancy cluster (Ti3C2Tx-V-C) engineered MXenes. Ruthenium atomic clusters, as a model catalyst, successfully anchor on all MXene substrates. Different from the terminal -O/-F coordination groups on routine Ti3C2Tx MXene surfaces, the Ti vacancy clusters in Ti3C2Tx-V-C create unique lattice carbon ligand environment toward Ru species, which induces ultra-strong MSI. As a result, compared to Ti3C2Tx-V-0 and Ti3C2Tx-V-S, the Ti3C2Tx-V-C modulated Ru clusters (Ru@Ti3C2Tx-V-C) exhibit the optimized balance of H2O adsorption/dissociation and OH/H desorption, thereby delivering superior electrocatalytic performance in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Within the wide range from laboratory-level (90 mA cm(-2)) to industrial-level (1.5 A cm(-2)) current density, Ru@Ti3C2Tx-V-C outperforms commercial Pt/C in terms of overpotential and mass activity. Moreover, as a universal substrate for noble metal catalysts, Ti3C2Tx-V-C can also anchor Ir/Pt/Rh atomic clusters and enable excellent HER catalytic activity. This work expands the scope of the MSI between MXene and noble metal catalysts.

Obesity is an important metabolic factor that greatly increases PDAC risk and mortality, worsens progression and leads to poor chemotherapeutic outcomes. With omics analysis, magnetic resonance and near-infrared fluorescence (MR/NIRF) dual-modality imaging and molecular functional verification, obesity as an important risk factor is proved to modulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and enhance Fibronectin (FN) infiltration in the PDAC stroma, that promotes tumor progression and worsens response to chemotherapy by reducing drug delivery. In the study, to visually evaluate FN in vivo and guide PDAC therapy, an FN-targeted nanoprobe, NP-CREKA, is synthesized by conjugating gadolinium chelates, NIR797 and fluorescein isothiocyanate to a polyamidoamine dendrimer functionalized with targeting peptides. A dual-modality strategy combining MR and NIRF imaging is applied, allowing effective visualization of FN in orthotopic PDAC with high spatial resolution, ideal sensitivity and excellent penetrability, especially in obese mice. In conclusion, the findings provide new insights into the potential of FN as an ideal target for therapeutic evaluation and improving treatment efficacy in PDAC, hopefully improving the specific management of PDAC in lean and obese hosts.

However, the stability of electrocatalysts is largely neglected, given the premise that they are stable over extended cycles. Notably, the reconstruction of electrocatalysts during the electrochemical reaction process has recently been proposed. Such in situ reconstruction process inevitably leads to varied electrocatalytic behaviors, such as catalytic sites, selectivity, activity, and amounts of catalytic sites. Therefore, a crucial prerequisite for the design of highly effective electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries is an in-depth understanding of the variation of active sites and the influence factors for the in situ reconstruction behaviors, which has not achieved a fundamental understanding and summary. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent advances in understanding the reconstruction behaviors of different electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries during the electrochemical reaction process, mainly including metal nitrides, metal oxides, metal selenides, metal fluorides, metals/alloys, and metal sulfides. Moreover, the unexplored issues and major challenges of understanding the reconstruction chemistry are summarized and prospected. Based on this review, new perspectives are offered into the reconstruction and true active sites of electrocatalysts for Li-S batteries.

However, the features of substantia nigra damage in GBA pathogenic variant carriers remain unclear. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the microstructural changes in the substantia nigra in non-manifesting GBA pathogenic variant carriers (GBA-NMC) and PD patients with GBA pathogenic variant (GBA-PD) with free-water imaging. Methods: First, we compared free water values in the posterior substantia nigra between non-manifesting noncarriers (NMNC, n = 29), GBA-NMC (n = 26), and GBAPD (n = 16). Then, free water values in the posterior substantia nigra were compared between GBA-PD and early- (n = 19) and late-onset (n = 40) idiopathic PD (iPD) patients. Furthermore, we examined whether the baseline free water values could predict the progressions of clinical symptoms. Results: The free water values in the posterior substantia nigra were significantly higher in the GBA-NMC and GBA-PD groups compared to NMNC, and were significantly increased in the GBA-PD group than both earlyand late-onset iPD. Free water values in the posterior substantia nigra could predict the progression of anxiety and cognitive decline in GBA-NMC and GBA-PD groups. Conclusions: We demonstrate that free water values are elevated in the substantia nigra and predict the development of non-motor symptoms in GBA-NMC and GBAPD. Our findings demonstrate that a significant nigral impairment already exists in GBA-NMC, and nigral injury may be more severe in GBA-PD than in iPD. These results support that free-water imaging can as a potential early marker of substantia nigra damage. (c) 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

This study compared two diets and explored the effectiveness of the diets when combined with a probiotic for treatment of IBS-D patients. MethodsPhase I, patients were randomized into groups; control, cold/spicy/fried restricted diet (CSF res diet), IgG positive restricted diet (IgG res diet), and a combination both diets (CSF + IgG res diet). Phase II, patients were randomized into IgG res diet + placebo and IgG res diet + probiotic. Both interventions were 12 weeks in duration. Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-D-SSS) and IgG titer were assessed at the beginning and the end of the study. ResultsTotals of 214 and 167 patients completed the two parts of the study, respectively. After intervention, IBS-D-SSS and TIgG grade were significantly improved compared to baseline, with results similar to the control group. In general, there were decreases in IBS-D-SSS and TIgG grade that were significantly different among the groups. There were exceptions; no differences were observed for IBS-D-SSS between the IgG res diet and CSF + IgG res diet, or TIgG grade between the CSF res diet, IgG res diet, and CSF + IgG res diet. However, the CSF res diet and IgG res diet had a synergistic effect that decreased IBS-D-SSS and TIgG titer, with a greater contribution by the IgG res diet. Therefore, we evaluated the IgG res diet with either placebo or probiotic and found that IBS-D-SSS and TIgG grade decreased from baseline. There was a significant decrease in IBS-D-SSS with the probiotic but TIgG grade was not significantly different between the IgG diet + placebo and IgG diet + probiotic diet. ConclusionsBoth the CSF res diet and IgG res diet improved IBS symptoms and demonstrated synergy, although the IgG res diet had a greater contribution. Further, when intolerant foods cannot be eliminated from a diet, avoiding uncooked, cold, spicy, fried, and alcoholic foods is a superior choice. The IgG res diet combined with Bifidobacteria was the best dietary choice and may function though a non-IgG pathway.

Accumulating studies, including ours, have demonstrated that basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF (activating transcription factor)-like 2 (BATF2) is a capable tumour suppressor that localises in the nucleus. However, its different subcellular localisation, potential functions and underlying mechanisms are unclear. MethodsThe translocation of BATF2 and its clinical relevance were detected using CRC samples, cell lines and xenograft nude mice. Candidate BATF2-binding proteins were screened using co-immunoprecipitation, quantitative label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proteomic analysis, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Recombinant plasmids, point mutations and siRNAs were applied to clarify the binding sites between BATF2 and chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1). ResultsThe present study found that BATF2 was mainly localised in the cytoplasm, rather than nucleus, of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, while cytoplasmic BATF2 expression was inversely correlated with the prognosis of CRC patients. Furthermore, we identified the nuclear export and subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation of BATF2 in CRC cells. Mechanistically, a functional nuclear export sequence (any amino acid) was characterised in BATF2 protein, through which BATF2 bound to CRM1 and translocated out of nucleus, ultimately enhancing CRC growth via inducing activator protein 1 (AP-1)/cyclin D1/phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) signalling pathway. Additionally, nuclear export of BATF2 can be retarded by the mutation of NES in BATF2 or the knockdown of CRM1, whereas CRM1 expression was negatively associated with nuclear BATF2 expression and the prognosis of CRC patients. ConclusionThese findings revealed the biological effects and underlying mechanisms of cytoplasmic localisation of BATF2. Furthermore, suppressing nuclear export of BATF2 via mutating its NES region or inhibiting CRM1 expression may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy against CRC.

A farm approach to integrate crops and livestock is the adoption of grazed cover crops. Moreover, the addition of perennial grasses into crop rotations may improve soil organic matter and decrease N leaching. However, the effect of grazing intensity in such systems is not fully understood. This 3-year study investigated short-term effects of cover crop planting (cover and no cover), cropping system (no grazing, integrated crop-livestock [ICL], and sod-based rotation [SBR]), grazing intensity (heavy, moderate, and light grazing), and cool-season N fertilization (0, 34, and 90 kg N ha(-1)) on NO3-N and NH4-N concentration in leachate, and cumulative N leaching by using 1.5-m deep drain gauges. The ICL was a cool-season cover crop-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) rotation, whereas SBR was a cool-season cover crop-bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) rotation. There was a treatment x year x season for cumulative N leaching (p = 0.035). Further contrast analysis indicated that cover crops decreased cumulative N leaching compared to no cover (18 vs. 32 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)). Nitrogen leaching was lesser for grazed compared to nongrazed systems (14 vs. 30 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)). Treatments containing bahiagrass had lesser NO3-N concentration in leachate (7 vs. 11 mg L-1) and cumulative N leaching (8 vs. 20 kg N ha(-1) season(-1)) compared to ICL systems. Adding cover crops can reduce cumulative N leaching in crop-livestock systems; moreover, warm-season perennial forages can further enhance this benefit.	[Santos, Erick R.

Modern lophophorates are quite diverse-some can biomineralize while others are soft-bodied, they could be either solitary or colonial, and they develop through various eccentric larval stages that undergo different types of metamorphoses. The diversity of this clade is further enriched by numerous extinct fossil lineages with their own distinct body plans and life histories. In this review, I discuss how data on phoronid development, genetics, and morphology can inform our understanding of lophophorate evolution. The actinotrocha larvae of phoronids is a well documented example of intercalation of the new larval body plan, which can be used to study how new life stages emerge in animals with biphasic life cycle. The genomic and embryonic data from phoronids, in concert with studies of the fossil lophophorates, allow the more precise reconstruction of the evolution of lophophorate biomineralization. Finally, the regenerative and asexual abilities of phoronids can shed new light on the evolution of coloniality in lophophorates. As evident from those examples, Phoronida occupies a central role in the discussion of the evolution of lophophorate body plans and life histories.

Robust rhythm reporting will advance ecological and evolutionary research	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						animal communication; bioacoustics; comparative approach; open science; reporting framework; rhythm; timing	ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION; CATEGORICAL RHYTHMS; SONG; DISCRIMINATION; PERCEPTION; MECHANISMS; CALLS	1. Rhythmicity in the millisecond to second range is a fundamental building block of communication and coordinated movement. But how widespread are rhythmic capacities across species, and how did they evolve under different environmental pressures? Comparative research is necessary to answer these questions but has been hindered by limited crosstalk and comparability among results from different study species. 2. Most acoustics studies do not explicitly focus on characterising or quantifying rhythm, but many are just a few scrapes away from contributing to and advancing the field of comparative rhythm research. Here, we present an eight--level rhythm reporting framework which details actionable steps researchers can take to report rhythm--relevant metrics. Levels fall into two categories: metric reporting and data sharing. Metric reporting levels include defining rhythm--relevant metrics, providing point estimates of temporal interval variability, reporting interval distributions, and conducting rhythm analyses. Data sharing levels are: sharing audio recordings, sharing interval durations, sharing sound element start and end times, and sharing audio recordings with sound element start/end times. 3. Using sounds recorded from a sperm whale as a case study, we demonstrate how each reporting framework level can be implemented on real data. We also highlight existing best practice examples from recent research spanning multiple species. We clearly detail how engagement with our framework can be tailored case-by--case based on how much time and effort researchers are willing to contribute. Finally, we illustrate how reporting at any of the suggested levels will help advance comparative rhythm research. 4. This framework will actively facilitate a comparative approach to acoustic rhythms while also promoting cooperation and data sustainability. By quantifying and reporting rhythm metrics more consistently and broadly, new avenues of inquiry and several long--standing, big picture research questions become more tractable. These lines of research can inform not only about the behavioural ecology of animals but also about the evolution of rhythm-relevant phenomena and the behavioural neuroscience of rhythm production and perception. Rhythm is clearly an emergent feature of life; adopting our framework, researchers from different fields and with different study species can help understand why.

Given a nondiagnosable discrete event system modeled with labeled Petri nets, a new labeling function can be designed to enforce the system to be diagnosable. An ad-hoc parallel composition of non-deterministic finite automata (derived from the original labeled Petri net model) that are observed at multiple observation sites is employed. In order to optimize a given labeling function as well as a sensor selection, an integer linear programming problem is formulated to associate numerical sensor costs with transition relabelings. In a multi-fault system, this method can determine the type of faults that occur and the fault sequences pertaining to this fault type if multiple faults occur. Examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed method.

The potential power of "studygram": Concrete visual representations may increase student motivation, engagement, and enjoyment of routine course assignments	PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS			English	Article; Early Access						concrete visualization; Instagram; motivation; online teaching; photo-taking; self-regulation; student engagement	SELF-REGULATION; MENTAL-IMAGERY; INTRINSIC MOTIVATION; ONLINE; PROCRASTINATION	Students are often unmotivated to engage with their online coursework. Research has shown that concretely visualizing one's goals (e.g., photo-taking) can improve motivation to learn. This study explored the effect of taking a photo of one's study space (i.e., a studygram photo similar to a post on Instagram) on students' motivation to start, engagement with, and enjoyment of routine assignments. In a within-subjects design, students took a photo of their study space before starting or after completing the assignment or took no photo. Data were collected from six undergraduate courses across three disciplines (Education, Psychology, and Theatre). Results revealed that students in an online Education course completing routine and formulaic assignments were significantly more motivated to start their coursework when they took a photo compared to when they did not. Results were similar for student engagement and enjoyment. Outcomes were replicated in the course's second iteration but were not found in the Psychology or Theatre courses. Differences between the courses' formatting may have lessened the impact of photo-taking on students' experiences. Together our results suggest that motivation and engagement with routine coursework may be influenced by an easy-to-implement visualization intervention under certain circumstances. Potential implications for teaching are reviewed.

Ultrahigh-Flux X-ray Detection by a Solution-Grown Perovskite CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> Single-Crystal Semiconductor Detector	ADVANCED MATERIALS			English	Article						perovskite CsPbBr3; solution-grown materials; ultrahigh flux; X-ray detectors	TEMPERATURE	Solution-processed perovskites are promising for hard X-ray and gamma-ray detection, but there are limited reports on their performance under extremely intense X-rays. Here, a solution-grown all-inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single-crystal semiconductor detector capable of operating at ultrahigh X-ray flux of 10(10) photons s(-1) mm(-2) is reported. High-quality solution-grown CsPbBr3 single crystals are fabricated into detectors with a Schottky diode structure of eutectic gallium indium/CsPbBr3/Au. A high reverse-bias voltage of 1000 V (435 V mm(-)(1)) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of approximate to 60-70 nA (approximate to 9-10 nA mm(-)(2)), which enables a high sensitivity larger than 10 000 mu C Gy(air)(-1) cm(-)(2) and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGy(air) s(-)(1). The CsPbBr3 semiconductor detector shows an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61 keV synchrotron X-rays with flux from 10(6) to 10(10) photons s(-)(1) mm(-)(2). Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy shows a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X-ray and a lab X-ray irradiated device. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution-grown CsPbBr3 single crystal may be associated with its good short-range order, comparable to the spectrometer-grade melt-grown CsPbBr3.

Blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy of bupivacaine liposomal suspension using static bodyweight distribution and subjective pain scoring in dogs after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy surgery	VETERINARY SURGERY			English	Article							POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; TRANSDERMAL FENTANYL; WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION; CLINICAL-EFFICACY; JOINT PAIN; TRAMADOL; PHARMACOKINETICS; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; SCALE	ObjectiveTo compare the analgesic effect of surgical wound infiltration with liposomal bupivacaine (LB) to saline placebo in dogs after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO). Study designBlinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical prospective study. AnimalsFifteen client-owned dogs receiving LB and 17 dogs receiving an equivalent volume of saline placebo, all with confirmed unilateral cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency. MethodsPreoperatively and up to 48 h after surgery, Glasgow Composite Measure Short Form (CMPS-SF) pain scores were assigned and using a weight distribution platform, static bodyweight distribution (%BWdist) to the operated limb was measured. Postoperatively, dogs also received carprofen 2.2 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 h. Rescue analgesia was provided. Treatment success was defined as not requiring rescue analgesia over the 48-h postoperative period. ResultsThere was no difference between treatment success, postoperative opioid consumption, CMPS-SF pain scores, or %BWdist in dogs that received surgical wound infiltration with LB compared with those receiving saline placebo, following TPLO. There was no linear correlation between CMPS-SF pain scores and %BWdist. ConclusionFor the population of dogs that underwent TPLO and received postoperative carprofen at our institution, LB did not provide an analgesic effect discernable by success/failure analysis, CMPS-SF pain scores, or %BWdist measurement using a weight distribution platform, compared with saline placebo. Clinical significanceLB may not provide detectable analgesia during the first 48 h for dogs recovering from TPLO and receiving only postoperative carprofen.

Optimization of the Hysteresis Effect in Superconductor Nb Open Nanotubes	PHYSICA STATUS SOLIDI-RAPID RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article; Early Access						Ginzburg-Landau equation; hysteresis; nanotubes; phase-slip; superconductivity; topological defects	PHASE-TRANSITIONS	Superconductor Nb open nanotubes are analyzed under a strong transport current in an external magnetic field using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. The geometric properties of the hysteresis loop in current-voltage characteristics are described for nanotubes of different radii from 190 to 440 nm as a function of the magnetic field. The hysteresis effect appears at a constant temperature as a result of the order parameter dynamics. In nanotubes of radii equal to 240 nm and larger, the area of the hysteresis loop manifests a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the external magnetic field with a maximum ranging from 15 to 20 mT. Normal conductivity is shown to have a crucial impact on the hysteresis effect in superconductor open nanotubes. Namely, a higher normal conductivity leads to the disappearance of the hysteresis effect. As a rule, the upper and lower branches of the hysteresis loop are provided by the phase-slip and vortex regimes, correspondingly. Just before the transition of the system from the upper branch to the lower one, the way of nucleation and annihilation of vortices in the region with suppressed superconductivity experiences readjustment.

The sensor is composed of pixels with programmable switches that allow each pixel to connect with its neighbors; in this way, an arbitrary detection pattern can be synthesized on it. The design was aimed to be part of an optical encoder based on a non-diffractive light beam; therefore, the purpose of the self-configuration routine is to find the center of the incident non-diffractive beam and then configure the detection pattern around it. The corresponding algorithm is implemented on a Zynq-7000 SoC allowing to automate the alignment of the beam with the detection pattern, without using micrometric positioning procedures. The frequency response of the analog front-end of the entire chip (the pixels and the amplification system) is addressed via SPICE simulations and experimental data and is consistent with the classical mathematical models, allowing us to propose future improvements to the design.

The photovoltaic efficiency of such devices is still a challenge due to the recombination of photogenerated carriers resulting from the intrinsic doping property of materials. Here, PdSe2-based graphene-sandwiched vertical devices with high photovoltaic efficiency are constructed. As the graphene-sandwiched structure limits the diffusion length to tens of nanometers, the carrier recombination during diffusion is spontaneously reduced. Moreover, due to the low-resistance contact of graphene/PdSe2, the Fermi level and carrier density of PdSe2 can still be significantly tuned by gate voltage, which leads to a sharp enhancement of built-in field and photovoltaic effect. As a result, the Gr/PdSe2/MoS2/Gr vdWH photovoltaic device shows a high power conversion efficiency of 3.9% and an open circuit voltage of 0.6 V under 650 nm laser illumination at room temperature. The present work provides an efficient scheme for the design of high-efficiency 2D material photovoltaic devices.

The grease with 3 wt% 60 nm h-BN particles and the grease with 1 wt% 500 nm h-BN particles lead to 22.34% and 20.18% reductions in the wear scar diameter, respectively, although the friction coefficients slightly decrease. The boric acid H3BO3 with layer-crystal structure produces during the friction process, and the synergistic effect of h-BN nanoparticles and H3BO3 makes friction reduction and wear-resistant enhancement. Furthermore, the 60 nm h-BN particles filled in the asperity valleys of the friction surface make a rolling effect and establish a protective film, while the 500 nm h-BN particles shield the asperity contact between friction pairs and make a polishing effect as well.

Comedications and genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in TAM metabolism contributes to this variability. Drug-drug and drug-gene interactions have seldom been studied in African Black populations. We evaluated the effects of commonly co-administered medicines on TAM pharmacokinetics in a cohort of 229 South African Black female patients with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. We also investigated the pharmacokinetic effects of genetic polymorphism in enzymes involved in TAM metabolism, including the variants CYP2D6*17 and *29, which have been mainly reported in people of African descent. TAM and its major metabolites, N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDM), 4-OH-tamoxifen, and endoxifen (ENDO), were quantified in plasma using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The GenoPharm open array was used to genotype CYP2D6, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Results showed that CYP2D6 diplotype and CYP2D6 phenotype significantly affected endoxifen concentration (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). CYP2D6*17 and CYP2D6*29 significantly reduced the metabolism of NDM to ENDO. Antiretroviral therapy had a significant effect on NDM levels and the TAM/NDM and NDM/ENDO metabolic ratios but did not result in significant effects on ENDO levels. In conclusion, CYP2D6 polymorphisms affected endoxifen concentration and the variants CYP2D6*17 and CYP2D6*29 significantly contributed to low exposure levels of ENDO. This study also suggests a low risk of drug-drug interaction in patients with breast cancer on TAM.

J	Deforth, M; Micheloud, C; Roes, KC; Held, L				Deforth, Manja; Micheloud, Charlotte; Roes, Kit C.; Held, Leonhard			Combining evidence from clinical trials in conditional or accelerated approval	PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						accelerated approval; conditional approval; harmonic mean chi-squared test; interim power; sample size calculation; two-trials rule		Conditional (European Medicines Agency) or accelerated (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approval of drugs allows earlier access to promising new treatments that address unmet medical needs. Certain post-marketing requirements must typically be met in order to obtain full approval, such as conducting a new post-market clinical trial. We study the applicability of the recently developed harmonic mean chi(2)-test to this conditional or accelerated approval framework. The proposed approach can be used both to support the design of the post-market trial and the analysis of the combined evidence provided by both trials. Other methods considered are the two-trials rule, Fisher's criterion and Stouffer's method. In contrast to some of the traditional methods, the harmonic mean chi(2)-test always requires a post-market clinical trial. If the p-value from the pre-market clinical trial is << 0.025, a smaller sample size for the post-market clinical trial is needed than with the two-trials rule. For illustration, we apply the harmonic mean chi(2)-test to a drug which received conditional (and later full) market licensing by the EMA. A simulation study is conducted to study the operating characteristics of the harmonic mean chi(2)-test and two-trials rule in more detail. We finally investigate the applicability of these two methods to compute the power at interim of an ongoing post-market trial. These results are expected to aid in the design and assessment of the required post-market studies in terms of the level of evidence required for full approval.

A cohort of 415 children with histiocytosis from the French histiocytosis registry was reviewed and analyzed for BRAF(V600E). Most BRAF(WT) samples were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a custom panel of genes for histiocytosis and myeloid neoplasia. Of 415 case samples, there were 366 LCH, 1 Erdheim-Chester disease, 21 Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), 21 juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG, mostly with severe presentation), and 6 malignant histiocytosis (MH). BRAF(V600E) was the most common mutation found in LCH (50.3%, n = 184). Among 105 non-BRAF(V600E)-mutated LCH case samples, NGS revealed mutations as follows: MAP2K1 (n = 44), BRAF exon 12 deletions (n = 26), and duplications (n = 8), other BRAF V600 codon mutation (n = 4), and non-MAP-kinase pathway genes (n = 5). Wild-type sequences were identified in 17.1% of samples. BRAF(V600E) was the only variant significantly correlated with critical presentations: organ-risk involvement and neurodegeneration. MAP-kinase pathway mutations were identified in seven RDD (mostly MAP2K1) and three JXG samples, but most samples were wild-type on NGS. Finally, two MH samples had KRAS mutations, and one had a novel BRAF(G469R) mutation. Rarely, we identified mutations unrelated to MAP-kinase pathway genes. In conclusion, we characterized the mutational spectrum of childhood LCH and clinical correlations of variants and subtypes. Variants responsible for JXG and RDD were not elucidated in more than half of the cases, calling for other sequencing approaches.

However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of HTL-free CsPbI3 C-PSCs is still lower than that of PSCs with HTL/ metal electrodes. This is because the direct contact between the carbon electrode and the perovskite layer has a higher requirement on the crystal quality of perovskite layer and matched energy level at perovskite/carbon interface. Herein, the acyl chloride group and its derivative trichloroacetyl chloride are used to passivate CsPbI3 C-PSCs for the first time. The results show that the carbonyl group of trichloroacetyl chloride can effectively passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions in perovskite. At the same time, leaving group Cl- ions can increase the grain size of perovskite and improve the crystallization quality of perovskite layer. In addition, the trichloroacetyl chloride tends to generate cesium chloride acetate, which acts as an electron blocking layer, reduces charge recombination, promotes gradient energy level arrangement, and effectively improves the separation and extraction ability of carriers. The PCE of CsPbI3 HTL-free C-PSCs is successfully increased from 13.40% to 14.82%.

Nevertheless, the wide bandgap and narrow spectral response of metal-oxide semiconductors are problematic for efficient metal-oxide optoelectronic devices such as photonic synapse and optical memory devices. Here, a simple titania (TiO2)/indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) heterojunction structure is proposed for efficient multifunctional optoelectronic devices, enabling widen spectral response range and high photoresponsivity. By overlaying a TiO2 film on IGZO, the light absorption range extends to red light, along with enhanced photoresponsivity in the full visible light region. By implementing the TiO2/IGZO heterojunction structure, various synaptic behaviors are successfully emulated such as short-term memory/long-term memory and paired pulse facilitation. Also, the TiO2/IGZO synaptic transistor exhibits a recognition rate up to 90.3% in recognizing handwritten digit images. Moreover, by regulating the photocarrier dynamics and retention behavior using gate-bias modulation, a reconfigurable multilevel (>= 8 states) memory is demonstrated using visible light.

Planar Sodium-Nickel Chloride Batteries with High Areal Capacity for Sustainable Energy Storage	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article; Early Access						alkali metal anodes; high-temperature ZEBRA batteries; molten-salt batteries; sodium-metal halide batteries; stationary energy storages	INTERMEDIATE-TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; CELL	High-temperature sodium-nickel chloride (Na-NiCl2) batteries are a promising solution for stationary energy storage, but the complex tubular geometry of the solid electrolyte represents a challenge for manufacturing. A planar electrolyte and cell design is more compatible with automated mass production. However, the planar cell design also faces a series of challenges, such as the management of molten phases during cycling. As a result, cycling of planar high-temperature cells until now focused on moderate areal capacities and current densities. In this work, planar cells capable of integrating cost-efficient nickel/iron electrodes at a substantially enhanced areal capacity of 150 mAh cm(-2) is presented. Due to a low cell resistance during operation at 300 degrees C, these cells deliver a specific discharge energy of 300 Wh kg(-1) at high discharge current densities of 80 mA cm(-2) (C/2, 10%-100% state-of-charge). This results represent the first demonstration of planar Na-NiCl2 cells at a commercially relevant combination of areal capacity, cycling rate, and energy efficiency. It is further identified the secondary molten NaAlCl4 electrolyte to contribute to the cell capacity during cycling. Mitigating electrochemical decomposition of NaAlCl4 will play an important role in further enhancing both cycling rates and cycle life of high temperature Na-NiCl2 batteries.

We compared the risk of kidney function decline between untreated and treated CHB patients receiving antiviral therapy.Methods: This retrospective study included 1061 untreated CHB patients and 366 tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), 190 besifovir dipivoxil maleate (BSV), and 2029 entecavir (ETV) users. The primary outcome was kidney function decline, a >= one-stage increase in chronic kidney disease for =3 consecutive months.Results: The incidence and risk of kidney function decline were significantly higher in the 1:1 propensity score matched treated group (588 pairs) than in the untreated (2.7 per 1000 person-years [PYs] vs. 1.3 per 1000 PYs, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.29, all p < 0.001). The matched TAF group (222 pairs) showed a similar risk for the primary outcome (aHR = 1.89, p = 0.107) despite a significantly higher incidence thereof, compared to the untreated (3.9 vs. 1.9 per 1000 PYs, p = 0.042). The matched BSV and untreated groups (107 pairs) showed no significant differences in the incidence and risk. However, ETV users (541 pairs) carried a significantly higher outcome incidence and risk than the matched untreated (3.6 vs. 1.1 per 1000 PYs, aHR = 1.05, all p < 0.001). Compared to each matched untreated group, changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate over time were greater in the ETV group (p = 0.010), despite being similar in the TAF (p = 0.073) and BSV groups (p = 0.926).Conclusions: Compared with untreated patients, TAF or BSV users showed similar risk, whereas ETV users showed a higher risk of kidney function decline.

J	Leech, J				Leech, Jessica			Ruth Barcan Marcus and Minimal Essentialism	RATIO			English	Article; Early Access						Barcan Marcus; essence; Fine; modality; necessity; quantified modal logic	PRIOREAN MODALITY FINE,KIT; FINEAN ESSENCE	Since the publication of Kit Fine's "Essence and Modality", there has been lively debate over how best to think of essence in relation to necessity. The present aim is to draw attention to a definition of essence in terms of modality that has not been given sufficient attention. This neglect is perhaps unsurprising, since it is not a proposal made in response to Fine's 1994 paper and ensuing discussion, but harks back to Ruth Barcan Marcus's earlier work in the 1960s and 1970s on essentialist claims. At the core of Barcan Marcus's account is Minimal Essentialism, of which there are several extensions, in particular, for cases of referential predicates (such as "x is identical to Socrates"), Individuating Essentialism, and Aristotelian Essentialism. I argue that Minimal Essentialism fares favourably against a host of familiar examples. I close with some historical observations, that the distinction between essence and necessity was already commonplace in the early days of quantified modal logic and its philosophy.

These, together with the increased extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, are the major transport barriers affecting the nanomedicine delivery to solid tumors. Due to the elevated pressure within the tumor microenvironment, the transport of nanomedicines through the interstitial space is limited to diffusion. While this particular scenario is central for nanomedicine delivery to solid tumors, it has not been modeled in vitro before. To this end, herein, a tumor-on-a-chip microfluidic device is developed that is capable of recapitulating the solid stress scenario in tumors. This is achieved by integrating a pneumatic actuation to apply compression to the enclosed hydrogel ECM filling medium. Transport studies of model nanoparticles (NPs) across this medium are performed to determine their diffusion. For these NPs, it is demonstrated that their transport is drastically reduced by 65% due to the compression of the ECM gel matrix, reducing its pore size, with only an applied pressure of approximate to 4 Pa. The results obtained show that the actuated tumor-on-a-chip device can be used to evaluate the diffusive penetration capability of nanomedicines within a mechanical-constrained microenvironment such that of tumors.

This difference is attributed to the individual's attribution of responsibility, which influences their cognition. In this study, a survey and eye-tracker were used to conduct a study on restaurant reviews between two groups of participants (U.S. and Japan). Result suggests that the presentation of food in an image has a stronger impact on the Japanese respondents than it is for Americans. Between the two groups of participants, Americans focused more on the positive ratings, whereas Japanese focus on the extreme end of the ratings (1-star vs. 5-star). The distribution of the star ratings, which forms a particular letter shape (e.g., E) also has an impact on respondents' decision-making process. Results show that Americans fixate on the shape of the distribution 7-8 times longer than the Japanese respondents. The result in this study suggests that the cultural cognition and attribution of responsibility, which is reflected in respondents' cultural dimensions (e.g., monumentalism vs. flexhumility), need to be considered. These considerations will affect how a company presents their information on a review site so that the content resonates and aids in their consumers' decision-making process.

Seed yield improvement in navy bean: Registration of 'ND Polar'	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS			English	Article; Early Access							WHITE-MOLD AVOIDANCE; CONSUMPTION; CULTIVARS; CANCER	'ND Polar' (Reg. no. CV-349, PI 700767) is a new navy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivar developed by the Dry Edible Bean Breeding Program at North Dakota State University and released by the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station. ND Polar was developed using a modified pedigree method (F-1-F-5), followed by pure line selection based on agronomic performance, disease resistance, and seed quality characteristics. With similar to 16% of the total dry bean production in the United States, navy bean is the third most important market class after pinto and black. Accounting for 35% of the total production, North Dakota is the largest producer of dry bean in the United States. Between 2015 and 2021, ND Polar was tested across 23 environments in North Dakota, where seed yield was significantly higher than 'HMS Medalist', 'Blizzard', and 'Ensign' and similar to 'T9905'. ND Polar is resistant to Bean common mosaic virus and has intermediate resistance to common bacterial blight. ND Polar has desirable upright architecture to facilitate direct harvest. Under North Dakota environments, ND Polar shows an average plant height of 52 cm, has a 100-seed weight of 18.3 g, and matures in 102 days. Canning quality was rated as acceptable. Similar to the commercial checks, ND Polar is susceptible to local races/strains of the bean rust pathogen, anthracnose, and white mold. Other traits of agronomic and economic importance are within acceptable ranges.

The synthesis of each RE-CU-10 analogue requires different reaction conditions to achieve phase pure products. Single crystal X-ray diffraction indicates the presence of a RE9-cluster in Y- to Tm-CU-10, while a RE11-cluster is observed for Yb- and Lu-CU-10. The photooxidation performance of RE-CU-10 analogues is evaluated, observing competition between linker-to-metal energy transfer versus the generation of singlet oxygen. The singlet oxygen produced is used to detoxify a mustard gas simulant 2-chloroethylethyl sulfide, with half-lives ranging from 4.0 to 5.8 min, some of the fastest reported to date using UV-irradiation and < 1 mol% catalyst, in methanol under O-2 saturation.

The advantages of the proposed microstrip coupler are novel structure, filtering frequency response, suppressed harmonics up to second harmonics, transmission poles, low losses, compact size, and good phase balance. The proposed structure is novel and different from the previous coupler designs such as rate-races, rings, and branch-lines types. It is presented for the first time in this work with a very small size and good performance. The size of this coupler is only 82.6 mm(2) (0.004 lambda g(2)). The common port return loss is 33 dB and the insertion losses at port 2 and port 3 are 2.2 and 2.7 dB, respectively. To prove the accuracy of the design method and simulation results, the proposed coupler is fabricated and measured where the measurement results confirm the simulation results and the proposed design method.

The addition of stabilizers improves the body, texture, appearance, and mouth feel of yogurt while also preventing technical defects such as syneresis. A study was conducted to optimize the concentration of taro starch in yogurt. The yogurt was fortified at different concentrations of taro starch. Taro starch levels were 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3%, with different storage times (0, 14, and 28 days). The Tukey honesty test was used for mean comparison (p < .1). The results of the study showed that maximum moisture and protein content was taken by using 0.5% taro starch and stored for 0 days while maximum fat % was attained in 1.5% taro starch treatment and storage time was 0 days. The maximum water-holding capacity was increased by adding 1.5% taro starch under 14 days' storage time. Water-holding capacity started decreasing with the increasing taro concentration. The acidity of yogurt started increasing with the increasing taro starch and the maximum acidity was taken at 2.5% taro starch concentration. The viscosity of the yogurt was maximum at 2% taro starch. As far as it concerned, sensory evolution, aroma, and taste started changing with the increasing taro starch concentration and increasing storage time. The study's goals were to optimize the taro concentration for stabilizing the yogurt synthesis and to probe the impact of taro starch on the physiochemical attributes of yogurt.

Study's purpose was to evaluate these in haemodialysis patients, and assess the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM). MethodsThe scores calculated in 237 haemodialysis patients, 121 diabetics (58 females) and 116 non-diabetics (41 females). Results correlated to cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, mortality). ResultsCHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score correlated with the occurrence of stroke and heart failure (p < .01, p < .01), (p < .01, p < .01), respectively in diabetics and non-diabetics. CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score could predict the risk of all-cause mortality in both groups, p = .03, p < .01, respectively, however, the risk of cardiovascular death could be predicted in non-diabetics, p < .01. Modified-CHADS(2) score associated with heart failure (p = .04), cardiovascular (p < .01) and all-cause mortality (p < .01) only on non-diabetics. C statistics indicated that the first score showed modest discrimination in patients with and without DM, for stroke and all-cause mortality. The second score performed modestly only on patients without DM for all-cause mortality. Both scores showed poor calibration. Stroke was a common cause of cardiovascular death (OR = 3.52, 95% CI = 1.92-6.47, p < .01) and associated with central venous catheter (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.12-4.27, p = .02) and pre-existing atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.06-3.58, p = .03). ConclusionCHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score correlated with stroke, heart failure and all-cause mortality in haemodialysis patients with and without DM. The risk of cardiovascular death could be predicted only in non-diabetics patients. Modified-CHADS(2) score correlated with heart failure, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality only on non-diabetics. Both had modest discrimination and poor calibration.

Based on the framing effect theory, we took waste sorting as a research context and explored the effects of goal frames and temporal frames on citizens' willingness to participate in coproduction through two between-subject survey experiments. We found that citizens' participation willingness was significantly increased when using goal frames or temporal frames. Furthermore, compared with gain frames, the effect of loss frames on citizens' willingness was significantly stronger, whereas the difference in the effect of present-oriented frames and future-oriented frames was not significant. When the information was constructed by combining loss frames and present-oriented frames, citizens' willingness reached the highest level among the four combinations. This study has implications for nudging coproduction by information frames and implies that presenting the loss-framed information in present-oriented frames can maximally promote citizens' willingness to participate in coproduction.

Even though been widely studied in various aspects, the physiological activities, such as intrinsic structural vibration and self-regulation process to stress of photosynthetic proteins, are still not in-depth resolved in real-time. Herein, utilizing silicon nanowire biosensors with ultrasensitive temporal and spatial resolution, real-time responses of a single photosystem I-light harvesting complex I (PSI-LHCI) supercomplex of Pisum sativum to various conditions, including gradient variations in temperature, illumination, and electric field, are recorded. Under different temperatures, there is a bi-state switch process associated with the intrinsic thermal vibration behavior. When the variations of illumination and the bias voltage are applied, two additional shoulder states, probably derived from the self-conformational adjustment, are observed. Based on real-time monitoring of the dynamic processes of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex under various conditions, it is successively testified to promising nanotechnology for protein profiling and biological functional integration in photosynthesis studies.

The construction of multilayer-bound nanoreactors to achieve management of intermediate CO is a promising strategy for tandem to C2+ products. In this study, a series of Ag@Cu2O nanoreactors consisting of an Ag-yolk and a multilayer confined Cu shell is designed to profile electrocatalytic CO2RR reactions. The optimized Ag@Cu2O-2 nanoreactor exhibits a 74% Faradaic efficiency during the C2+ pathway and remains stable for over 10 h at a bias current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Using the finite element method, this model determines that the certain volume of cavity in the Ag@Cu2O nanoreactors facilitates on-site CO retention and that multilayers of Cu species favor CO capture. Density functional theory calculations illustrate that the biased generation of ethanol products may arise from the (100)/(111) interface of the Cu layer. In-depth explorations in multilayer-bound nanoreactors provide structural and interfacial guidance for sequential coupling of CO2RR intermediates for efficient C2+ generation.

J	Zhao, R; Zhang, XD; Gabriel, JL; Martín, JAR; Wu, KN				Zhao, Rui; Zhang, Xiaodan; Gabriel, Jose Luis; Martin, Jose Antonio Rodriguez; Wu, Kening			Classification of agricultural land consolidation types based on soil security to improve limiting factors adapted to local soil conditions	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						field-scale; improvable limiting factors; soil multifunctionality; soil preservation; sustainable soil management	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-CARBON; CROP YIELDS; NITROGEN; CHINA; PRODUCTIVITY; IMPACTS; SEQUESTRATION; FUMIGATION; DIMENSIONS	Agricultural land consolidation (ALC) is an effective tool to ensure national food security. The current ALC is a government-led systematic behavior with regional characteristics, most ALC types are classified according to difficulty without considering the safety of soil systems, resulting in randomness in the site selection of projects. Given the soil complexity, ensuring soil security (SS) is a prerequisite for efficiently completing ALC. ALC that gives full play to the soil's functional advantages is an effective means of securing SS. The main goal of this study is to establish a new set of technical processes for classifying the types of ALC from the perspective of SS, including the agricultural SS evaluation system and the identification method of land-improvable limiting factors. We used a generalized mean model to evaluate and analyze SS in multiple dimensions and identified 11 combinations of limiting factors in Wen County through the k-means clustering method. The combination of the limiting factor clustering area with the SS spatial distribution patterns guided five ALC types. When compared using the spatial pattern comparison method, the new ALC guideline avoids the singularity of ALC types, selects the field patch as the evaluation and decision-making unit, and improves the accuracy of land management measures. The results indicate that incorporating SS into ALC policy planning and decision-making can provide complex and multifaceted knowledge of factors affecting SS, and potential solutions to make agricultural soils safer, enabling higher quality and sustainability of agricultural land use.

Despite long-lasting efforts, the existing methods still suffer limitations in the design of photoelectrodes with optimal structures for efficient operation. Herein, a novel porous gallium nitride (PGaN) photoanode decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) is fabricated. After microstructural optimization, this composite photoanode improves the water-splitting efficiency from 0.036% to 0.30% and exhibits a 2.7 times improvement of the photocurrent density in comparison with the planar GaN photoanode. The significant improvement of the water-splitting efficiency is attributed to the synergistic combination of the porous structure with the plasmonic AuNPs that greatly benefits electron-hole pairs generation, separation, and charge-carrier transport. The photoanode is robust and easy to fabricate, and this work provides an idea for future exploration of durable and efficient GaN-based photoelectrodes.

However, current methods for creating Janus fabrics are typically complex, environmentally unfriendly, and costly. More importantly, the prepared Janus fabrics have demonstrated insufficient mechanical properties and poor fastness, rendering them unsuitable for practical applications. Here, this work proposes a method for constructing Janus fabrics through thermal transfer printing of hydrophobic transfer prints onto a superhydrophilic cotton fabric, followed by creation of a conical micropore array on the fabric surface. The as-prepared Janus fabrics exhibit excellent unidirectional liquid transport capacity, capable of transporting 50 mu L water completely in 11.6 s in the positive direction. Attributed to the durable property of the transfer prints, the Janus fabrics are capable of withstanding over 900 friction cycles and 250 home laundry cycles, which is a great advance in this research field. Additionally, the fabrication process has no detrimental effect on the fabric's breathability, elasticity, and flexibility. Furthermore, the Janus fabric can maintain human body temperature 3.6 degrees C cooler than that worn with cotton fabric. The fabrication method can provide useful insights for the design and creation of durable Janus fabrics to maximize personal comfort.

However, because of China's hukou system, urban migrants can have limited access to different public services in urban areas. Consequently, this can affect their consumption and savings behaviour. However, little is known about how the hukou system changes migrants' allocation of savings across different savings instruments. In this study, we utilize the 2013 round of the Urban and Rural Residents Income Distribution and Living Conditions Survey of China to see if migrants' hukou status affects allocation between short-term and long-term assets. Propensity score matching is used to match migrants with migrants who have obtained urban hukou. When comparing the urban migrants having rural hukou with hukou holders who converted their hukou from rural to urban, we find that the migrants hold significantly higher proportions of savings in cash and other short-term assets. Those who have obtained urban hukou, appear to hold a greater share of their portfolio in long-term, higher returning assets. The differences in portfolio allocations appear to be larger for migrants with lower household income. We argue that these results are consistent with savings behaviour driven by a precautionary motive.	[Chen, Guowen; DeLoach, Stephen B.; Islam, T. M.

We compared three different methods of preparation. Method 1 consisted of the dissolution of bulk chips of glaze, dilution of the solution and mass spectrometric analysis without Pb purification. Method 2 collected the Pb from the surface of the glaze with acid-impregnated swabs, subsequent dilution and direct analysis of the sample solution. Method 3 used solutions from method 1, extraction of Pb by ion-exchange chromatography and analysis of the purified Pb. Each preparation method produced a similar Pb isotope ratio. The majority of the Pb isotope ratios fall into one group and indicate that lead imported from the Krakow-Silesia mining region was mainly used for production of the glazes of the stove tiles made by different workshops.

We develop a compound-hazard impact model that improves on the ARIO model by considering the economic interplay between different types of hazardous events. The model considers simultaneously cross-regional substitution and production specialization, which can influence the resilience of the economy to multiple shocks. We build scenarios to investigate economic impacts when a flood and a pandemic lockdown collide and how these are affected by the timing, duration, and intensity/strictness of each shock. In addition, we examine how export restrictions during a pandemic impact the economic losses and recovery, especially when there is the specialization of production of key sectors. The results suggest that an immediate, stricter but shorter pandemic control policy would help to reduce the economic costs inflicted by a perfect storm, and regional or global cooperation is needed to address the spillover effects of such compound events, especially in the context of the risks from deglobalization.

Predictability of success for combined iStent inject trabecular bypass implantation with phacoemulsification in the subsequent eye	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article						glaucoma; glaucoma incisional surgery; open angle glaucoma	OUTFLOW; STENT; DIFFERENCE; OUTCOMES	BackgroundTo investigate in combined iStent inject implantation with phacoemulsification carried out bilaterally, whether intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effectiveness in the first eye has a predictive potential for the outcome of the second eye in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). MethodsThis retrospective study included 72 eyes from 36 participants, who underwent trabecular bypass implantation in combination with cataract surgery at two study centres (Dusseldorf, Cologne). Surgery was classified as either 'success' or 'failure' based on three scores: IOP at follow-up <21 mmHg (Score A) or IOP < 18 mmHg (Score B), with an IOP reduction >20% respectively, without re-surgery and IOP <= 15 mmHg with an IOP reduction >= 40%, without re-surgery (Score C). ResultsThe IOP lowering outcomes of first and second eyes did not differ significantly. There was a significantly higher chance of success in the second eye after effective surgery in the first eye compared with cases after a preceding failure. Within our cohort, a 76% probability of success for the subsequent eye was determined following prior success for Score A. This probability was reduced to 13% if surgery in the first eye failed. The respective probabilities were 75% and 13% for Score B and 40% and 7% for Score C. ConclusionsIn bilateral trabecular bypass implantation combined with cataract surgery, there is a high predictive potential for subsequent eyes based on the extent of IOP-lowering in the initial eye, which should be considered by the surgeon for second eye surgeries.

Skin gloss is a perception-based characteristic, which yet needs to be evaluated quantitatively and objectively. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the perception of matte, glossiness and greasiness on Korean women's skin, focusing on the effect of surface reflection. MethodsIn this study, a visual evaluation of skin gloss was performed using modulated images that combined facial reference (normal) images with images characterized by 64 different levels of surface reflection to investigate factors that might affect the perception of matte, glossy and greasy skin. Fifteen participants classified the respective images into three categories (matte, glossy and greasy), and the intensity of each image was rated using a three-point scale (weak, moderate or strong). A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed using 960 data points (n = 64 x 15). A high-frequency average + 1 standard deviation (SD = 4) was set as the criterion for a highly glossy object. ResultsA significant difference was found between the three categories considering four parameters: low-frequency mean (LFM) and SD (LFSD) and high-frequency mean (HFM) and SD (HFSD). The results of the multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that LFM and HFSD were significant influencing factors for perceiving matte, glossiness and greasiness. As the LFM and HFSD of the images increased, perception changed from matte, to glossy and greasy. Further, the total number and total area of highly glossy objects were significantly different among the three categories. ConclusionWe identified four different factors related to perceiving matte, glossiness and greasiness on the faces of Korean women, including the LFM and HFSD of surface reflection, as well as the number of highly glossy objects and the area of surface reflection. Furthermore, we identified evenness of shine as a key factor for the perception of greasiness. These parameters could be useful for distinguishing skin gloss and for a quantitative evaluation of greasiness.

Among several neuromorphic hardware issues, a robust device functionality under extreme temperature is of particular importance for practical applications. Given that the organic memristors for artificial synapse applications are demonstrated under room temperature, achieving a robust device performance at extremely low or high temperature is still utterly challenging. In this work, the temperature issue is addressed by tuning the functionality of the solution-based organic polymeric memristor. The optimized memristor demonstrates a reliable performance under both the cryogenic and high-temperature environments. The unencapsulated organic polymeric memristor shows a robust memristive response under test temperature ranging from 77 to 573 K. Utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiling, the device working mechanism is unveiled by comparing the compositional profiles of the fresh and written organic polymeric memristors. A reversible ion migration induced by an applied voltage contributes to the characteristic switching behavior of the memristor. Herein, both the robust memristive response achieved at extreme temperatures and the verified device working mechanism will remarkably accelerate the development of memristors in neuromorphic systems.

However, their applications in Zn-based DIBs are restricted because the high charge density of divalent Zn2+ aggravates the ionic interactions in ionic networks and leads to insufficient Zn2+ mobility. Herein, we introduce a hydrofluoroether diluent into a Zn-based IL electrolyte to break down the larger ionic aggregates into smaller ones with weakened ionic interactions. This unique solvation structure reduces the Stokes radius of Zn2+ from 1.3 nm to 0.97 nm and increases its diffusion coefficient by similar to 30 times while retaining the high oxidation stability, enabling the charge/discharge cycling of Zn/graphite DIBs at a high rate of 20 C. Moreover, the enhanced mobility of Zn2+ also promotes compact Zn deposition, which allows the operation of anode-free Zn/graphite DIBs with 90% capacity retention after 100 cycles.

Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five-membered biradical [P-*(NTer)2C(R)P-*] (2R, R= phenyl, naphthyl) in the first step, followed by C-H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile,which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo- and naphtho-azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C-H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo- and naphtho-azaphospholes.

This study identified 203 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLHs) in Z. latifolia and showed that ZlbHLH196 (Zla16G011250) corresponds to the ZlRc gene in Z. latifolia, with its protein product localizing to the nucleus. Notably, the pericarps of ZlRc-overexpressing (OE) rice are brown, whereas those of wild-type (WT) rice are nonpigmented. The total phenolic, flavonoid, and proanthocyanidin contents, antioxidant activity, as well as enzyme inhibitory effects of ZlRc-OE rice were significantly higher than those of WT rice. Overall, 221 differential phenolic metabolites were identified between ZlRc-OE and WT rice, among which 198 were upregulated in the former. Additionally, a total of 227 differentially expressed genes were identified between ZlRc-OE and WT rice, with 173 upregulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation and enrichment analysis of phenolic metabolites revealed enhanced isoflavonoid, flavone, flavonol, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways in ZlRc-OE rice, which, furthermore, showed a markedly upregulated expression and significantly higher activities of four key flavonoid biosynthesis-related enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase, chalcone-flavanone isomerase, and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase). These findings show that ZlRc-overexpression promotes phenolic compound accumulation in rice seeds and can be used to bioaugment rice phenolic content.

Possible mitigating effect of adropin on lung injury in diabetic rats: Targeting the role of Rho A/Rho-associated kinase pathway	BIOFACTORS			English	Article; Early Access						adropin; diabetic; hyperglycemia; lung injury; Rho A/ROCK pathway	MODEL; HYPERGLYCEMIA; GLUCOSE; CELLS; HOMEOSTASIS; METABOLISM; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION; DISORDER; MELLITUS	This study evaluated possible mitigating effect of adropin on lung injury in diabetic rats, targeting role of Rho A/Rho-associated kinase pathway. Rats were allocated into four groups: control, adropin, diabetic, and diabetic+adropin groups. At the termination of the experiment, serum fasting glucose, insulin and adropin levels and insulin resistance were calculated. Wet/dry ratio, histopathological, immunohistochemical analyses, and relative real time gene expression of lung tissue was determined. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, malondialdehyde, 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, Bcl-2, BAX, myeloperoxidase, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and transforming growth factor-beta were determined in lung tissue. Adropin treatment in diabetic rats notably attenuated hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Also, it mitigated diabetic lung injury via suppressing effect on Rho A/ROCK pathway, apoptosis, inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, and fibrosis of lung tissue. Adropin can be considered as a promising therapeutic agent for treating diabetic lung injury.

However, whether a common mechanism governs the variations of all leaf mineral elements is still unknown.Location: Global.Time period: 1970- 2020. 10.Major taxa studied: Plants.Methods: Here, we demonstrate the global- scale biogeographic patterns of 12 major mineral elements (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, aluminium, iron, manganese, sodium, zinc and copper) by compiling a global data set including 2710 records of leaf mineral elements for 1073 species and of associated climate and soil indices.Results: In general, like nitrogen and phosphorus, elements including potassium, cal-cium, magnesium, sodium and copper in leaf declined towards the equator, which sup -ported both plant physiological hypothesis and soil substrate age hypotheses developed on the basis of nitrogen and phosphorus. By contrast, other elements responded to latitude in a contrary manner as nitrogen and phosphorus, in line with a competing mechanism, temperature-biogeochemistry hypothesis. Besides, plant functional types intrinsically differed in mineral concentrations, and to a certain extent, shifts of their composition in turn exacerbated the latitudinal patterns of respective elements as predicted by the species composition hypothesis.Main conclusions: The fundamentally different dynamics and control mechanisms of patterns of some elements compared with those of nitrogen and phosphorus chal-lenge the idea that common hypotheses can predict biogeographic patterns across all mineral elements; thus, current paradigms of element biogeochemical models and ecological plant nutrition require revision.

Upon this, a conventional confocal DSLM can be easily upgraded to a dual-slit confocal DSLM with two-fold imaging speed.

Nevertheless, how to design principled deep learning (DL) models capable of encoding these geometric structures remains largely unknown. We address this open problem by introducing a universal causal geometric DL framework in which the user specifies a suitable pair of metric spaces X$\mathcal {X}$ and Y$\mathcal {Y}$ and our framework returns a DL model capable of causally approximating any "regular" map sending time series in XZ$\mathcal {X}<^>{\mathbb {Z}}$ to time series in YZ$\mathcal {Y}<^>{\mathbb {Z}}$ while respecting their forward flow of information throughout time. Suitable geometries on Y$\mathcal {Y}$ include various (adapted) Wasserstein spaces arising in optimal stopping problems, a variety of statistical manifolds describing the conditional distribution of continuous-time finite state Markov chains, and all Frechet spaces admitting a Schauder basis, for example, as in classical finance. Suitable spaces X$\mathcal {X}$ are compact subsets of any Euclidean space. Our results all quantitatively express the number of parameters needed for our DL model to achieve a given approximation error as a function of the target map's regularity and the geometric structure both of X$\mathcal {X}$ and of Y$\mathcal {Y}$. Even when omitting any temporal structure, our universal approximation theorems are the first guarantees that Holder functions, defined between such X$\mathcal {X}$ and Y$\mathcal {Y}$ can be approximated by DL models.

Comparison of the Thermal and Rheological Properties of Frontiere Brown Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, and Potato Starch and Mixture Effects on Pasting Properties in Aqueous Systems	STARCH-STARKE			English	Article						mixture design; pasting properties; potato; rice; tapioca	GELATINIZATION; QUALITY; PROTEIN; DESIGN; WHEAT; WAXY; RVA	Gluten-free blends utilize starches, gums, hydrocolloids, and proteins for viscoelasticity, gas holding ability, and crumb structure of dough and batter without gluten. This study examines Frontiere brown rice flour (HPBRF), a new high protein rice cultivar, with tapioca starch (TS) and potato starch (PS) in an aqueous model system in a mixture design, to study interaction effects on pasting properties. The effect of the flour from this new cultivar on the pasting properties of other starches typically used in gluten-free products has not yet been tested. Pasting properties are analyzed with a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA). Rheological and thermal characterization of the flour and starches are also done using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a rheometer. The blends of HPBRF and PS affect the pasting properties compared to each alone, and it is observed that the application of HPBRF with PS decreases breakdown viscosity and peak viscosity, significantly compared to PS alone. Also, the ternary mixture considerably decreases the retrogradation potential for HPBRF, which indicates more stability during storage. These positive and negative effects can indicate how combined usage of these ingredients for the development of bakery products can impact physiochemical properties of gluten-free bakery products.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, septin hetero-oligomers interact with the plasma membrane (PM) almost exclusively at the future site of cytokinesis. While multiple mechanisms of membrane recruitment have been identified, including direct interactions with specific phospholipids and curvature-sensitive interactions via amphipathic helices, these do not fully explain why yeast septins do not localize all over the inner leaflet of the PM. While engineering an inducible split-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) system to measure the kinetics of yeast septin complex assembly, we found that ectopic co-overexpression of two tagged septins, Cdc3 and Cdc10, resulted in nearly uniform PM localization, as well as perturbation of endogenous septin function. Septin localization and function in gametogenesis were also perturbed. PM localization required the C-terminal YFP fragment fused to the C terminus of Cdc3, the septin-associated kinases Cla4 and Gin4, and phosphotidylinositol-4,5-bis-phosphate (PI[4,5]P-2), but not the putative PI(4,5)P-2-binding residues in Cdc3. Endogenous Cdc10 was recruited to the PM, likely contributing to the functional interference. PM-localized septins did not exchange with the cytosolic pool, indicative of stable polymers. These findings provide new clues as to what normally restricts septin localization to specific membranes.

Such a relationship is important because of the increasingly diverse population of school-aged children who are likely to attend racially segregated K-12 schools and colleges, the benefits for individuals and society of STEM college graduates, and the projected shortage of people trained for future STEM workforce demands. We use a unique panel data set (N = 14,980) of the University of North Carolina graduates. Our main analytical approach is multilevel modeling to examine the relationship between attending a sequence of racially diverse educational institutions and the odds of declaring and/or graduating with a STEM major. We find that students who attended a diverse sequence of schools are more likely to declare and graduate with STEM majors than those who did not. Framing our results with theories of cumulative advantage and intergroup contact theories, we offer science education policy reform recommendations.

We measured inflammatory cytokines associated with the IL-23/IL-17 immune axis in the serum of patients with psoriasis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Psoriasis was induced in male C57BL/6J mice using imiquimod (IMQ) cream, and animals received intraperitoneal injections of recombinant mouse anti-IL-23A or anti-IL-17A antibodies for 7 days. The potential effects of the IL-23/IL-17 immune axis on skin inflammation were assessed based on pathology scoring, hematoxylin-eosin staining of skin samples, and quantitation of inflammatory cytokines. Western blotting was used to evaluate levels of the following factors in skin: ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF-?B, and pNF-?B. The serum of psoriasis patients showed elevated levels of several cytokines involved in the IL-23/IL-17 immune axis: IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23, and interferon-?. Levels of IL-23p19 and IL-17 were increased in serum and skin of IMQ-treated mice, while ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF-?B, and pNF-?B were upregulated in the skin. A large proportion of NF-?B p65 localized in nucleus of involucrin(+) cells in the epidermis and in F4/80(+) cells of the dermis of psoriatic lesional skin. Treating these animals with anti-IL-23 or anti-IL-17 antibodies improved pathological score and immune imbalance, mitigated skin inflammation and downregulated ACT1, TRAF6, TAK1, NF-?B, and pNF-?B in skin. Our results suggest that skin inflammation mediated by the IL-23/IL-17 immune axis in psoriasis involves activation of the ACT1/TRAF6/TAK1/NF-?B pathway in keratinocytes and macrophage.

ObjectivesThis observational cross-sectional survey investigated the different types and modalities of protective mask wearing and the possible association with referred signs of temporomandibular disorders and orofacial pain by respondents. MethodsAn online questionnaire was developed, calibrated and administered anonymously to subjects with an age of >= 18 years. It consisted of different sections: demographics, type and wearing modalities of the protective masks, pain in the preauricular area, noise at the temporomandibular joints and headache. Statistical analysis was performed using statistical software STATA. ResultsThe questionnaire received 665 replies mainly from participants aged between 18 and 30 years (315 males and 350 females). The healthcare professionals were 37% of participants, 21.2% of them were dentists. The Filtering Facepiece 2 or 3 (FFP2/FFP3) mask was used by 334 subjects (50.3%), and 578 (87%) wore the mask with two elastics behind the ears. Pain while wearing the mask was referred by 400 participants, and 36.8% of them referred pain with a consecutive use of more than 4 h (p = .042). 92.2% of participants did not report any preauricular noise. Headache associated with the FFP2/FFP3 was referred by 57.7% of subjects (p = .033). ConclusionThis survey highlighted the increased referred the presence of discomfort in the preauricular area and headache possibly associated with a prolonged use of protective face masks for more than 4 h during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Current molecular classification is largely based on genes with highly variable expression without considering their functional roles. Here, we sought to identify HNSCC essential genes for patient stratification and prognostication.Methods: Essential genes for HNSCC were screened from genome-wide CRISPR knockout datasets. Candidates were further identified through univariate Cox regression. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was utilized to develop the prognostic signature. Candidate essential genes were exploited to classify patients into subgroups by consensus clustering. Survival outcomes, genomic alterations, signaling activities, and therapeutic vulnerabilities were compared between patient subgroups.Results: Sixty-eight genes were identified as candidates and utilized to develop an 8-gene prognostic signature. Patients were segregated into two clusters with distinct survival rates across multiple cohorts based on upregulated essential genes. Cluster 2 exhibited higher TP53, CDKN2A, and NOTCH1 mutations, higher stromal activities, worse prognosis as well as and sensitivities to cell cycle inhibitors. Cluster 1 was characterized by a better prognosis and susceptibility to PI3K/AKT and MAPK inhibitors.Conclusion: Our study developed a novel and robust prognostic signature and classification derived from essential genes for HNSCC, which sheds new light on HNSCC precision oncology.

We sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard pharmacotherapy in the rate and rhythm control of AF in the nonpostoperative patient cohort given that randomized control trials (RCTs) have shown conflicting results. MethodsRandomized controlled trials comparing IV Mg versus placebo in addition to standard of care were identified via electronic database searches. Nine RCTs were returned with a total of 1048 patients. Primary efficacy endpoints were study-defined rate control and rhythm control/reversion to sinus rhythm. The secondary endpoint was patient experienced side effects. ResultsOur analysis found IV Mg in addition to standard care was successful in achieving rate control (odd ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-3.11, p = .02) and rhythm control (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04-2.03, p = .03). Although not well reported among studies, there was no significant difference between groups regarding the likelihood of experiencing side effects. ConclusionsIV Mg, in addition to standard-of-care pharmacotherapy, increases the rates of successful rate and rhythm control in nonpostoperative patients with AF with rapid ventricular response and is well tolerated.

The major clinical features of this syndrome include congenital cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, intellectual disability, and a distinctive flat facial appearance. MAF has been identified as a causative gene of the syndrome, and heterozygous variants owing to impairment in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-mediated MAF phosphorylation shows related disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms of these types of disorders in affected individuals remain poorly understood. To explore the underlying mechanisms and discover new phenotypes, a murine model with a Maf mutation on a GSK3 phosphorylation motif, p.Thr58Ile, was generated using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. This is a homologous mutation to that in human patients. Our murine model exhibited similar phenotypes to those in humans, such as lens abnormalities, short stature, growth retardation, and abnormal skull morphology. The murine model showed decreased brain volume and malocclusion. Considering the sequencing and genotyping data, our models were successfully generated for the first time (to the best of our knowledge). Therefore, this study offers new and unique functional insights into human and murine MAF and novel clinical values of MAF pathogenic variants associated with changes in the functions of several organs based on a viable murine model.

Elongated galactan side chains mediate cellulose-pectin interactions in engineered Arabidopsis secondary cell walls	PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Arabidopsis thaliana; secondary cell wall; pectin; galactan; solid state nuclear magnetic resonance; biofuels; recalcitrance	LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; POLYSACCHARIDES; RESONANCE; BIOSYNTHESIS; MICROFIBRILS; XYLOGLUCAN; THALIANA; DYNAMICS; ARABINAN	The plant secondary cell wall is a thickened matrix of polysaccharides and lignin deposited at the cessation of growth in some cells. It forms the majority of carbon in lignocellulosic biomass, and it is an abundant and renewable source for forage, fiber, materials, fuels, and bioproducts. The complex structure and arrangement of the cell wall polymers mean that the carbon is difficult to access in an economical and sustainable way. One solution is to alter the cell wall polymer structure so that it is more suited to downstream processing. However, it remains difficult to predict what the effects of this engineering will be on the assembly, architecture, and properties of the cell wall. Here, we make use of Arabidopsis plants expressing a suite of genes to increase pectic galactan chain length in the secondary cell wall. Using multi-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that increasing galactan chain length enhances pectin-cellulose spatial contacts and increases cellulose crystallinity. We also found that the increased galactan content leads to fewer spatial contacts of cellulose with xyloglucan and the backbone of pectin. Hence, we propose that the elongated galactan side chains compete with xyloglucan and the pectic backbone for cellulose interactions. Due to the galactan topology, this may result in comparatively weak interactions and disrupt the cell wall architecture. Therefore, introduction of this strategy into trees or other bioenergy crops would benefit from cell-specific expression strategies to avoid negative effects on plant growth.

The formalism is developed for a particular f (R, L-m) function, namely R/16p + (1 + sR)L-m, with s being a constant that carries the geometry-matter coupling.

Herein, a facile approach to the growth of highly disordered graphene nanosheets (HDGNs) is demonstrated on a cheap and weaving quartz-braided structure as a functionalized scaffold for the differentiation of nerve cells. The patterned aligned structure can effectively integrate the advantages of a conductive graphene-functional interface (favorable for cell attachment and growth), topologically woven surface structure, providing a flexible and multifunctional regulatory platform for nerve cell growth. Compared with monocrystal polycrystalline graphene, amorphous graphene has high biocompatibility due to sufficient active sites, and has high conductivity to the composite nonconductive substrate, which can realize electrical stimulation (ES) of cell differentiation. Herein, the HDGN/quartz fabric with high biocompatibility (the cell viability is 98%), and great electrical conductivity, is proved. Then, the applied ES coupled with HDGN/quartz fabric significantly enhances selective neuronal differentiation into neurons (the differentiation growth rate is 131%). Collectively, herein, a new material basis is provided for electric induction of cell growth and differentiation, providing more possibilities for the development of intelligent biological applications.

Herein, the small-module gears are fabricated by micro-metal injection molding (micro-MIM) and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the gears are characterized. The small-module gears are successfully molded, debounded, and sintered based on the feedstock with 58% powder loading. The structure and mechanical properties of the samples are investigated in relation to the sintering temperature for the determination of optimum sintering conditions. The results show that the relative density and average grain size increase with the increment of sintering temperature, and the maximum relative density of 97.6% is obtained at the sintering temperature of 1320 degrees C. The tensile strength and hardness of the sintered sample are 2034 MPa and 709 HV at 1320 degrees C, respectively, presenting the most desirable mechanical properties, which are attributed to the formation of martensite with high strength and hardness at the expense of pearlite and ferrite and the alloy carbide precipitations in the microstructure. Herein, important guidance to develop low-cost and high-performance small-module gear is provided by using micro-MIM.

Fisetin, a flavonoid phytoestrogen derived from a range of fruits and vegetables, has been reported to exert cardioprotective effects against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated fisetin's cardioprotective role and mechanism against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts and ovariectomized (OVX) rat models. MTT assay revealed that fisetin treatment noticeably rescued DOX-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, western blotting and TUNEL-DAPI staining showed that fisetin significantly attenuated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the insulin-like growth factor II receptor (IGF-IIR) apoptotic pathway through estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha/-beta activation. The echocardiography, biochemical assay, and H&E staining results demonstrated that fisetin reduced DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by alleviating cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury, oxidative stress, and histopathological damage. These findings imply that fisetin has a significant therapeutic potential against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

To save the limited communication network resources, the distributed adaptive event-triggered FTCC scheme is investigated for the multiple UAVs and UGVs which does not require continuous information relating to its neighbours. It is proven that the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded by utilizing the Lyapunov function approach. Furthermore, the Zeno behaviour is excluded with the proposed scheme. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

This study estimated the prevalence and mortality of CLP using surveillance data collected from birth defect registries around the world.Methods: Data from 22 population- and hospital-based surveillance programs affiliated with the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR) in 18 countries on live births (LB), stillbirths (SB), and elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) for CLP from 1974 to 2014 were analyzed. Prevalence and survival (survival for LB only) estimates were calculated for total and subclassifications of CLP and by pregnancy outcome.Results: The pooled prevalence of total CLP cases was 6.4 CLP per 10,000 births. The prevalence of CLP and all of the pregnancy outcomes varied across programs. Higher ETOPFA rates were recorded in most European programs compared to programs in other continents. In programs reporting low ETOPFA rates or where there was no ascertainment of ETOPFA, the rate of CLP among LB and SB was higher compared to those where ETOPFA rates were ascertained. Overall survival for total CLP was 91%. For isolated CLP, the survival was 97.7%. CLP associated with multiple congenital anomalies had an overall survival of 77.1%, and for CLP associated with genetic/chromosomal syndromes, overall survival was 40.9%.Conclusions: Total CLP prevalence reported in this study is lower than estimates from prior studies, with variation by pregnancy outcomes between programs. Survival was lower when CLP was associated with other congenital anomalies or syndromes compared to isolated CLP.

MethodsEmbase, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane Central databases were evaluated, and 11 studies were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on body weight and measures of body composition and glycaemic control, to compare the effect of hypocaloric diet plus exercise with hypocaloric diet alone. ResultsExercise interventions consisted of walking or jogging, cycle ergometer training, football training or resistance training and duration varied from 2 to 52 weeks. Body weight and measures of body composition and glycaemic control decreased during both the combined intervention and hypocaloric diet alone. Mean difference in change of body weight (-0.77 kg [95% CI: -2.03; 0.50]), BMI (-0.34 kg/m(2) [95% CI: -0.73; 0.05]), waist circumference (-1.42 cm [95% CI: -3.84; 1.00]), fat-free mass (-0.18 kg [95% CI: -0.52; 0.17]), fat mass (-1.61 kg [95% CI: -4.42; 1.19]), fasting glucose (+0.14 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.02; 0.30]), HbA(1c) (-1 mmol/mol [95% CI: -3; 1], -0.1% [95% CI: -0.2; 0.1]) and HOMA-IR (+0.01 [95% CI: -0.40; 0.42]) was not statistically different between the combined intervention and hypocaloric diet alone. Two studies reported VO2max and showed significant increases upon the addition of exercise to hypocaloric diet. ConclusionsBased on limited data, we did not find additional effects of exercise to hypocaloric diet in adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes on body weight, body composition or glycaemic control, while cardio-respiratory fitness improved.

Accordingly, different research on restoration techniques have been carried out to proffer solution to the network component failures. In the same vein, this article proposes a hybridized enhanced genetic algorithm and ant colony system (EGAACS) survivability model, which can instantly resolve node-link failure problems, thus improving the quality of service of the wireless network. The EGAACS is a hybrid model that combines the principles of the enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) and ant colony system (ACS) models to form a capacity efficiency solution that outperforms the ACS and EGA models in terms of path cost and transmission delay. The resilience of this proposed EGAACS model is verified for different wireless network sizes (20, 30, 40, and 50 node networks). Simulation results show that the proposed EGAACS model generates the best close to optimal paths in terms of the path cost and transmission delay in comparison to the EGA and ACS models. In fact, the performance of the proposed EGAACS model is more conspicuous as the size of the network increases. More importantly, the proposed EGAACS model is suitable for real-time wireless network as it exhibits moderate computational time complexity.

Bio-Carbon as a Means of Carbon Management in Roads	ADVANCED SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS			English	Article						algae biomass; biochar; bitumen; plastics; sustainability	MODIFIED ASPHALT; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS; PYROLYSIS TEMPERATURE; BIOCHAR; PERFORMANCE; ADSORPTION; MODIFIER; MOISTURE; SYSTEMS	This paper introduces biocarbon, referred to as biochar, as a novel eco-friendly and cost-effective additive to increase interactions among bitumen components while facilitating carbon management in roadway infrastructures. It is hypothesized that functional groups on biochar surfaces enhance interactions between biochar and bitumen constituents. This in turn enhances mechanical properties and durability of asphalt pavements. This study uses biochars derived from six different types of woody biomass and one type of algae, and polyethylene terephthalate granules as a carrier to introduce biochar to bitumen. Quantum-based molecular modeling and noncovalent interaction analysis show that algal biochar interacts more effectively with bitumen components. The enhanced interaction of algal biochar is attributed to its surface functional groups including reactive nitrogen- and oxygen-carrying functional groups. The rheological characterization of bitumen doped with different biochars confirms that the lowest separation index occurs for bitumen containing algal biochar, which also exhibits the highest percent of elastic recovery and resistance to permanent deformation. The study suggests that asphalt pavement durability can be enhanced by selection of the proper biochar to increase intermolecular interactions. Promising results for the algae biochar promote its use in carbon management for roadway infrastructure by sequestering CO2 from air through photosynthesis of algae biomass.

The aim of the study was to assess the satisfaction of patients who underwent the autotransplantation of a developing premolar to replace a traumatised maxillary central incisor. Materials and methods: Eighty patients (with a mean age of 10.7-years) and 32 parents were surveyed with 13 and 7 questions, respectively, to determine their opinions about the surgery, post-operative period, orthodontic and restorative treatment they had received. Results: Patients and their parents were very satisfied with the outcomes of the autotransplantation treatment. The majority of patients and all parents declared that they would choose this treatment again if needed. Patients who already had aesthetic restoration of the transplanted toothscored significantly better in position, similarity to other teeth, alignment and aesthetics, when compared to patients before restoration of the premolar to the shape of incisor. Patients after orthodontic treatment considered the alignment of the transplanted tooth between the adjacent teeth as better when compared to patients before or during their orthodontic treatment. Conclusions: Autotransplantation of developing premolars to replace traumatized maxillary central incisors proved to be a well-accepted treatment option. A delay of restoration of the transplanted premolars to the shape of the maxillary incisors did not have a negative impact on the satisfaction with the treatment.

Significantly, the simple protocol could allow an efficient construction of biologically important phthalide framework. The transformation could be extended to a wide variety of unsaturated carboxylic acids, including substituted 2-vinyl benzoic acids and different types of alkenoic acids. Moreover, a series of aroyl, heteroaroyl chlorides could serve as coupling partners. Notably, functional groups including MeO, F, Cl and Br could survive. It is believed that acyl radicals generated from acyl chlorides under photoredox catalysis reacted with alkenes via atom-transfer radical addition (ATRA) and triggered subsequent lactonization in the process. Preliminary mechanistic investigations revealed that the transformation probably proceeded through a free radical pathway.

BackgroundFamily members of individuals who develop a critical illness requiring emergency hospitalisation are unlikely to be prepared for a possible death. This places them at increased risk of poorer bereavement experiences. One potential intervention is memory making, which is an act that provides tangible objects such as a handprint, footprint, lock of hair, or teddy bear, that allows connections with and provides meaningful memories about a person. Families in the adult acute population reportedly have positive reactions regarding the objects, but it is unknown the object's effects on early bereavement experiences. DesignDescriptive qualitative study utilising inductive reflexive thematic analysis. Reporting adheres to the COREQ checklist. MethodsBetween May 2019-December 2020, a purposeful, convenience sample of 21 participants from a tertiary referral, adult intensive care unit in Australia were recruited to explore their experiences being offered memory making during end-of-life care and the objects use in early bereavement. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format and occurred at the participants' location of choice. ResultsData analysis generated three themes: guidance during end of life by healthcare professionals that recognises the autonomy of the family; object used as a trigger to access memories; and storage and preservation of the object as an indication of its sentimental value and use in early bereavement ConclusionMemory making objects such as handprints, locks of hair, or teddy bears received in the adult intensive care unit were valued and utilised during early bereavement by most recipients. Relevance to clinical practiceFindings inform practice evidence gaps regarding the family's experiences of memory making received as a bereavement intervention in the adult acute population. Patient or public contributionParticipants contributed through sharing their first-hand experiences of receiving memory making in the adult intensive care unit.

These characteristics describe most companies in the fish processing industry. Using a sample of more than 1050 European fish processing companies during the period 2013-2020 and applying dynamic panel data methods, this paper analyses the extent to which working capital investment and financing policies affect firm's sales growth. The empirical evidence reveals that the trade credit channel (i.e., accounts receivable and accounts payable) enhances sales growth, while the opposite effect is found for investment in inventories. Additionally, the findings insist on the importance of financing current assets with positive working capital to boost sales growth. [EconLit Citations: C23, G31, L25, L79, Q22].

As these events were unfolding, we surveyed a sample of Americans (N = 625) to assess their reactions to this news, whether they supported the pausing of the vaccine, and potential psychological factors underlying their decision. In addition, we employed automated text analyses as a supporting method to more classical quantitative measures. Results showed that political ideology influenced the support for the pausing of the vaccine; liberals were more likely to oppose it than conservatives. In addition, the effect of political ideology was mediated by the difference between perceived benefit and risk and the language style used to produce reasons in support (or against) the decision to pause the vaccine. Liberals perceived the benefit of vaccines higher than the risk, used a more analytic language style when stating their reasons, and had a more positive attitude toward the vaccine. We discuss the implications of our findings considering vaccine hesitancy and risk perception during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, cesarean section is a risk factor for unsuccessful early initiation of breastfeeding. Herein, we aim to explore women's experiences of breastfeeding after a cesarean section. MethodsWe used the Joanna Briggs Institute framework in this meta-synthesis. We searched articles published from 1990 to 2022 on PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane library, PsycInfo, and EMBASE to identify qualitative studies on women's experiences of breastfeeding after a cesarean section. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist for qualitative studies to assess the quality of the included studies. ResultsSeven qualitative studies from five countries met the inclusion criteria, representing the views of 194 women who underwent cesarean sections. Six new categories were integrated into the women's experiences of breastfeeding after a cesarean section as follows: (i) Perceived values of breastfeeding, (ii) Emotional vulnerability in breastfeeding, (iii) Physical difficulties in breastfeeding, (iv) Inconvenient conditions in breastfeeding, (v) Inadequate resources for breastfeeding, and (vi) Support systems to enable breastfeeding. ConclusionsWe provide evidence showing that knowledge of the specific breastfeeding mechanism and provision of the most appropriate postsurgical care by healthcare providers just after a cesarean section can reduce the barriers to post-cesarean breastfeeding. Moreover, effective hospital policies and family support can result in the initiation of positive breastfeeding outcomes. Future studies that consider the cultural aspects of breastfeeding practice may generate additional insights into providing optimal postpartum care.

To tackle this, major contributions are made in three aspects. First, a novel shape-based feature is proposed to quantify the amount of fibrotic and nodular components in a lung tissue pattern which helps to minimize intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity. Second, we address the curse of dimensionality which often arises due to huge feature space. Third, to prevent an overfitting issue, the Grid Search optimization algorithm is utilized by tuning the Random Forest hyper-parameters. In this manuscript, a framework is proposed to categorize lung tissue patterns by integrating four types of feature domains (a) intensity-based, (b) texture-based, (c) wavelet-based, and (d) shape-based along with the novel shape-based feature. As a result, we encounter a large feature space (i.e., 18893x233$$ 18893\times 233 $$), which leads to high dimensionality. To address this issue, we reduce the feature space using filter-based f-statistic, reliefF, minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and embedded-based decision trees, regularization models. We found that the regularization model shrinks the feature space by 2.5 times in just 90 s whereas mRMR methods reduce the feature space by 10 times in 13 min. Using the proposed feature set, we employ Random Forest and Logistic Regression as potential classifiers to classify lung tissue patterns. Experiential results reveal that the proposed framework categorizes lung tissue patterns more effectively than state-of-the-art hand-crafted and deep learning-based approaches.

The proposed technique, which uses a small-signal model equivalent circuit under cold pinch-off operating conditions, is based on the proposal of a new small-signal equivalent circuit which allows extracting first the extrinsic resistances and inductances.

As young people are likely to be the group most impacted by political decisions relating to the climate crisis, it is essential to understand their views about government decision-making. Methods A qualitatively-led online survey of n = 500 young Australians aged 15-24 years. Open text questions sought young people ' s views about current government climate policies, perceptions about policy effectiveness, and how governments could improve their climate responses. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to interpret and construct themes from the data. Results Young people perceived that governments were not taking serious action on the climate crisis. They stated that climate policies were largely influenced by economic imperatives, rather than concern for the wellbeing of current and future generations. They perceived that governments had a duty of care to protect them from the climate crisis, and needed to engage young people in climate discussions and decision-making. Conclusions Young people ' s perspectives about the political determinants of the climate crisis provides information about their understanding of government policies and their recommendations for action. There is a need for collaboration between young people and decision-makers to urgently develop effective climate policies.So What ? Young people understand key issues relating to the political determinants of the climate crisis. The health promotion community has a role in advocating for structural changes in policymaking processes to ensure young people have a seat at the decision-making table.

Effects of differential risk attitudes in collaborative systems design	SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						collaborative design; game theory; multi-actor simulation; risk attitudes	DOMINANCE; GAMES	Collaboration enables multiple actors with different objectives to work together and achieve a goal beyond individual capabilities. However, strategic uncertainty from partners' actions introduces a potential for losses under failed collaboration relative to pursuing an independent system. The fundamental tradeoff between high-value but uncertain outcomes from collaborative systems and lower-value but more certain outcomes for independent systems induces a bistability strategic dynamic. Actors exhibit different risk attitudes that impact decisions under uncertainty which complicate shared understanding of collaborative dynamics. This paper investigates how risk attitudes affect design and strategy decisions in collaborative systems through the lens of game theory. First, an analytical model studies the effect of differential risk attitudes in a two-actor problem with stag-hunting strategic dynamics formulated as single- and bi-level games. Next, a simulation model pairs actors with different risk attitudes in a 29-game tournament based on a prior behavioral experiment. Results show that outcomes collaborative design problems change based on the risk attitudes of both actors. Results also emphasize that considering conservative lower-level design options facilitates collaboration by providing risk-averse actors with a safer solution. By accepting that decision-making actors are not all risk-neutral, future work seeks to develop new design methods to strengthen the adoption of efficient collaborative solutions.

Many works claimed the importance of spillover effects while studying CO2 emissions. Most part of them considers these indirect effects from a geographical perspective. The reduction of transportation costs makes other factors more important. Thus, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the existence of spatial dependence, considering geographical and economic proximity and comparing both measures. Empirically, we make use of the World Input-Output database with a worldwide focus from 2000 to 2014. Based on an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model, we estimate the CO2 emissions embodied in the domestic production and international trade between countries. To analyse the dependence from both perspectives, we carry out a spatial econometric analysis and make use of two different spatial weight matrices. The results offer a new approach on this field, highlighting the importance of the spillover effects to explain the CO2 emissions of the local country, showing that economic proximity is even more important than geographical one.

Management of vagus nerve simulation therapy in the peri-operative period Guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists	ANAESTHESIA			English	Article						complications; epilepsy; vagus nerve stimulator	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; VENTRICULAR ASYSTOLE; HEART-BLOCK; STIMULATION; EPILEPSY; BRADYCARDIA; CHILDREN; VNS; COMPLICATION; MECHANISMS	Vagus nerve stimulation is a well-established treatment option for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and has an expanding range of other clinical indications. Side effects of vagus nerve stimulation therapy include: cough; voice changes; vocal cord adduction; rarely, obstructive sleep apnoea; and arrhythmia. Patients with implanted vagus nerve stimulation devices may present for unrelated surgery and critical care to clinicians who are unfamiliar with their function and safe management. These guidelines have been formulated by multidisciplinary consensus based on case reports, case series and expert opinion to support clinicians in the management of patients with these devices. The aim is to provide specific guidance on the management of vagus nerve stimulation devices in the following scenarios: the peri-operative period; peripartum period; during critical illness; and in the MRI suite. Patients should be aware of the importance of carrying their personal vagus nerve stimulation device magnet with them at all times to facilitate urgent device deactivation if necessary. We advise that it is generally safer to formally deactivate vagus nerve stimulation devices before general and spinal anaesthesia. During periods of critical illness associated with haemodynamic instability, we also advise cessation of vagus nerve stimulation and early consultation with neurology services.

While IR spectroscopy revealed the existence of two isomers in solution with distinct nu(CO) band patterns, DFT calculations indicated that these isomers correspond to rotamers around the Mn-NHC bond and their different spectroscopic properties were rationalized by the occurrence of attractive pi(C=C)...pi*(C equivalent to O) or sigma(C-H)...pi*(C equivalent to O) intramolecular interligand interactions. The evaluation of this complex in catalytic hydrosilylation of acetophenone using Ph2SiH2 under UV irradiation led to the formation of the corresponding (R)-alcohol with low enantioselectivity.

The SC-SSR utilizes an interior metal-silicide stratum space at a predetermined radial distance inside silica nanosphere to guide the magnesiothermic reduction reaction (MTR)-mediated synthesis of hollow and porous SiNSs. In depth mechanistic study explores solid-to-hollow transformation encompassing predefined radial boundary through the participation of metal-silicide species directing the in-situ formed Si-phase accumulation within the narrow stratum. Evolving thin-porous Si-shell remains well protected by the in-situ segregated MgO emerging as a protective cast against the heat-induced deformation and interparticle sintering. Retrieved hydrophilic SiNSs (<100 nm) can be conveniently processed in different biomedia as colloidal solutions and endocytosized inside cells as photoluminescence (PL)-based bioimaging probes. Inside the cell, rattle-like SiNSs encapsulated with Pd nanocrystals can function as biorthogonal nanoreactors to catalyze intracellular synthesis of probe molecules through C-C cross coupling reaction.

However, the linker exchange method has so far only been described for COFs with relatively weak linkages like imines. Herein, it is shown that this method can be also used for a post-synthetic linker exchange reaction on a beta-ketoenamine linked COF. The time needed to achieve considerable linker exchange is much prolonged compared to other COFs with less stable linkages, however, this enables to achieve very good control on the ratio of the respective building blocks within the framework.

This study is the first to investigate size, encapsulation efficiencies, release behavior of Artemisia turcomanic loaded niosomal nanocarriers, and the anticancer effect of niosomal nanocarriers by MTT assay, flow cytometry, and real time (on HeLa cell lines). When the molar ratio of cholesterol: surfactant was 1 : 2 and the liquid content was 300 mu mol, the highest percentage of entrapment efficiency was 83.25 %. Moreover, niosomal formulation showed a pH-dependent release; a slow-release profile in physiological pH (7.4), and a more significant release rate at acidic conditions (pH=5.4). In addition, The apoptotic rate of Artemisia loaded niosomes on HeLa cell lines was higher than free extract and pristine niosome. Also, reduction in the expression levels of Bcl2, caspase-3, and p53 genes and increase in the expression level of BAX after treatment with Artemisia turcomanic-loaded niosomes were more significant than those after treatment with free Artemisia turcomanic and blank niosome. The cytotoxicity results of samples presented that Artemisia turcomanic loaded niosomes are more beneficial in the death of HeLa cell lines.

Radar emitter identification (REI) is an important technique in spectrum management. Methods based on deep learning have been successful in REI. However, they are difficult to be updated with signals from newly available categories. Additionally, two issues that must be considered in a real REI task. First, signals from new unknown radar emitters may appear in the identification stage. Hence the model used in REI must have an open-set recognition capability. Second, obtaining numerous labelled samples in time are difficult in the incremental stage of the model. Thus, it is important to keep the model performance stable under conditions of small samples. To solve these problems, a one-dimensional neural network is designed combined with ArcFace loss in the initial training stage to reserve more embedding space for future new classes, thereby facilitating the update of the model and open-set recognition. An unbiased cosine similarity classifier was adopted, and the historical categories were memorised by their prototypes. When a new category is added, the prototype was calculated and the classifier weights were updated. The proposed method can identify unknown classes and add them to the model when given new labels, thereby resulting in an increase of the model's identifiable types. Extensive experiments were performed. The results show that the proposed model is highly efficient and requires small sample sizes, thereby making it suitable for REI.

Exposure of Ni to ecosystems is of concern because Ni can be toxic to aquatic organisms. The influence of water chemistry constituents (e.g., hardness, pH, dissolved organic carbon) on the toxicity of Ni has prompted the development and use of bioavailability models, such as biotic ligand models (BLMs), which have been demonstrated to accurately predict Ni toxicity in broadly different ecosystems, including Europe, North America, and Australia. China, a leading producer of Ni, is considering bioavailability-based approaches for regulating Ni emissions. Adoption of bioavailability-based approaches in China requires information to demonstrate the validity of bioavailability models for the local water chemistry conditions. The present study investigates the toxicity of Ni to three standard test species (Daphnia magna, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Danio rerio) in field-collected natural waters that are broadly representative of the range of water chemistries and bioavailabilities encountered in Chinese lakes and rivers. All experimental data are within a factor of 3 of the BLM predicted values for all tests with all species. For D. magna, six of seven waters were predicted within a factor of 2 of the experimental result. Comparison of experimental data against BLM predictions shows that the existing Ni bioavailability models are able to explain the differences in toxicity that result from water chemistry conditions in China. Validation of bioavailability models to water chemistries and bioavailability ranges within China provides technical support for the derivation of site-specific Ni water quality criteria in China.

Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) can potentially increase the adequacy rate and improve diagnostic yield, while providing additional information for rapid clinical decisions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of ROSE in obtaining adequate tissue for diagnosis of renal lesions in our institution.Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all percutaneous renal CNB cases with available ROSE interpretations for a 11-year period. The ROSE interpretations and CNB diagnoses was compared and the concordance rate was calculated accordingly. The discrepant cases were re-reviewed and the possible causes for discrepancy were analyzed.Results: A total of 189 cases were identified. Definitive diagnoses were rendered in 164 (87%) cases on the final CNBs, including primary renal lesions in 151 cases and metastatic malignancies in 13 cases. At the time of ROSE, samples were deemed to be adequate in the majority of cases (83%). The calculated concordance rate between ROSE interpretations and CNB final diagnoses was 84.6%. Sampling issue and scant tumor cells were the main causes for the discordance between ROSE interpretations and CNB diagnoses.Conclusion: Our study showed a relatively high-concordance rate of 84.6% between ROSE interpretations and CNB final diagnoses, suggesting that ROSE is a valuable tool for procurement of adequate renal CNB samples for diagnosis.

We evaluated the effects of exercise with different levels of supervision on clinical outcomes in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Methods: We performed a single--blind randomized controlled trial in a university outpatient clinic. Overall, 45 (31 men) patients with ankylosing spondylitis were randomly allocated to 3 groups. The mean (SD) for age and disease duration were 39.3 (9.3) and 8.4 (7.8) years. The primary outcome was chest expansion in cm, and the secondary outcomes were the index scores of 5 standard questionnaires. For each participant, adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 mL/2 wk was injected and a 3- -session exercise program per week for 1 month was prescribed. Controls received a pamphlet on the exercise program. Another group received the pamphlet and underwent a 2--hour training session. The supervised group received the pamphlet, and the 2--hour training, and completed the program by attending each exercise session in the clinic. Results: Within--group analysis showed significant improvement in chest expansion (P = 0.016) and all subjective or objective questionnaire scores (all P < 0.001) for the full--supervised group. Between--group analysis implied best outcomes for chest expansion (P = 0.046), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (P < 0.001), Bath Disease Activity (P = 0.010), and Metrology (P = 0.002) Indices for ankylosing spondylitis. The group with 2--hour training experienced an improvement in some indices, and the control group did not show significant changes in the outcomes. Conclusion: We recommend the prescription of a supervised training program instead of in--home exercises for patients with ankylosing spondylitis.

ADDICTION			English	Article; Early Access						Alcohol; family and other relationship effects; harm to others; heavy episodic drinking; household; inequalities; survey	VIOLENCE; PREVALENCE; AUSTRALIA; DRINKING; FAMILY; WORLD	Background and aimsAlcohol's harm to others (AHTO) has become a key driver of national and international alcohol policy. This study aimed to produce a contemporary, comprehensive estimate of the correlates and harms from others' drinking in 2021 in Australia. Design, setting, participants and measurementsAcross Australia, 2574 adults (1380 women; 1172 men) were sampled via two cross-sectional survey modes: a random-digit dial mobile phone sample of 1000 people and 1574 people from the Life in Australia (TM) panel survey. In 2021 participants were asked about harms they had experienced from the drinking of family, friends, co-workers and the public in the past year. Applying combined sample weights from each mode, bivariable and adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyse differences in rates of AHTO by participant gender, age, residence in rural or metropolitan regions, country of birth, education and employment. FindingsIn 2021, 23.6% reported being negatively affected by strangers' drinking and 21.3% by the drinking of someone they knew, with 34.3% reporting being negatively affected a lot or a little by either; 42.4% of respondents reported specific harms from strangers' drinking. Thus, 48.1% of respondents reported any harm (negative effects or specific harms) from others' drinking. Women, younger people, Australian-born and heavier episodic drinkers reported significantly higher rates of AHTO compared with other respondents. Smaller percentages (7.5%) of participants reported being harmed substantially by others' drinking, including by people they knew (5.8%) or strangers (2.3%). Stratified analyses showed that heavier drinking, furloughed, younger men who were born overseas in English-speaking countries were affected by others' drinking, whereas women were affected regardless of these factors (apart from age). ConclusionsMore than one-third of Australian adults appear to have been negatively affected by others' drinking in 2021, with women, younger people and heavier drinkers at greater risk. Substantial harm appears to be more likely to arise from the drinking of people Australians know than from strangers' drinking.

As laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) processes are used to produce topologically optimized lightweight structures with complex geometries, which cannot be fully machined, the influence of the process-induced surface on the fatigue behavior needs to be analyzed. For this, also the interrelation of the surface-induced notch effects with the surrounding material volume must be considered. As thermal treatments can also be applied to filigree components with complex geometries, in the presented work the influence of different heat treatments, i.e., stress relief annealing (SR) and artificial aging (T6), on the material properties, especially the defect tolerance, of AlSi10Mg manufactured via PBF-LB is analyzed. Both heat treatments lead to a dissolution of the cellular Si-rich network, resulting in decreased hardness and tensile strength, but higher fatigue strength. The increased fatigue strength results from a reduction of the process-induced residual stresses, but mainly a strongly improved defect tolerance. Consequently, to evaluate the fatigue strength of additively manufactured materials, besides the materials strength and the process-induced defects, also the defect tolerance must be considered.

Materials and MethodsPatients with single implant-supported fixed restorations in the anterior maxilla were recruited. For the impression procedure, an intraoral scan was acquired by both the direct and the indirect techniques. For the delivery procedure, implants were randomly allocated into one of the two groups according to the approaches of digital impression preceding definite crown fabrication (A-direct technique; B-indirect technique) and were scanned again after the definite crown delivery. The stereolithography files were superimposed to analyze changes in peri-implant soft tissue contour after the delivery procedure. The main outcomes were dimensional deviations of peri-implant mucosa, and the secondary outcome was differences in the pink esthetic score (PES). ResultsA total of 20 implants that underwent the complete workflow were included. After the delivery procedure, significant deviations in palatal tissue thickness between the provisional and definite crowns were observed in Group A but these were absent in Group B. Additionally, deviations in labial thickness (0.27 +/- 0.12 mm vs. 0.08 +/- 0.09 mm) and palatal thickness (0.17 +/- 0.15 mm vs. 0.03 +/- 0.08 mm), and labial volume of soft tissue (1.87 +/- 0.94 mm(3) vs. 0.75 +/- 0.74 mm(3)) in Group A were significantly higher than those in Group B. No significant differences in PES were found. ConclusionThe indirect technique of scanning the provisional crown can more accurately duplicate the peri-implant soft tissue contour than the direct technique, resulting in a smaller deviation of the soft tissue in the delivery procedure.

Herein, it is discovered that the 1T-phase degree in monolayer MoS2 can be enhanced through sulfidation of the Pd species deposited on MoS2 (PdxSy/1T-MoS2). Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the sulfidation-assisted phase transition results in considerably greater proportions of 1T-phase fraction (up to 86%) without using alkali-metal-based approaches. Observations of S-atom displacement/translation at the atomic level contribute to the understanding of the phase transformation of MoS2. The maximized surface atom activation and metal utilization efficiency in PdxSy/1T-MoS2 lead to unprecedentedly high mass activity (-3444 A mg(Pd)(-1)) and turnover frequency (1892 s(-1)), three orders of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C 10 wt% (3.6 A mg(Pt)(-1) and 3.6 s(-1)). The sulfidation-assisted 1T-phase enrichment has major implications for the designs of efficient electrocatalysts through MoS2 phase engineering.

Examination of the impacts of the immediate interest rate of the United States and the VIX on the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index	BULLETIN OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						asymmetry; financial conditions; Islamic stocks; quantile-based analysis; regime changes	STOCK MARKETS; VOLATILITY SPILLOVERS; ECONOMIC-ACTIVITY; RISK-FACTORS; DCC-MGARCH; OIL PRICES; TRANSMISSION; CAUSALITY; RETURNS; ENERGY	This study examines the effects of the market volatility index of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (VIX) and the immediate interest rate of the United States on the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index (DJIMI) using quantile-based techniques and wavelet coherence (WTC) analysis with monthly data for the period January 2010to May 2021. A quantile cointegration model indicated that the relationship between the VIX and the DJIMI can be valid in the long term since the estimated coefficients are negative and statistically significant across the quantiles 0.05 and 0.50, while a quantile autoregressive model revealed that large negative and positive changes in the VIX and the immediate interest rate of the United States do not have a significant impact on the DJIMI in the short term. Allowing the role of regime changes, it was found by the quantile regression model that an increase in the VIX lowers the performance in the DJIMI, supported by the WTC. It was also underlined that the DJIMI may not benefit from the positive financial conditions. According to the quantile regression models, the immediate interest rate of the US has asymmetrical effects, and the stabilizing effect of the increase/decrease is valid during bearish/bullish market conditions in the DJIMI.

Herein, we successfully developed a coupled piezocatalytic and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) system for achieving the conversion of various organic pollutants to CO. The CO product stems from the specific process in which organics are first oxidized to carbonate through peroxymonosulfate (PMS)-based AOPs, and then the as-obtained carbonate is converted into CO by piezoelectric reduction under ultrasonic (US) vibration by using a Co3S4/MoS2 catalyst. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the introduction of Co3S4 not only effectively promotes the transfer and utilization of piezoelectric electrons but also realizes highly selective conversion from carbonate to CO. The Co3S4/MoS2/PMS system has achieved selective generation of CO in actual complex wastewater treatment for the first time, indicating its potential practical applicability.

It consisted of shrinking shape memory alloy (SMA) thick-film actuators and a supporting coil spring array. The SMA actuator array was designed and fabricated using a flash-evaporated SMA film (10 mu m thick) on a mirror-polished Cu substrate. The coil spring was successfully arrayed on a glass substrate with an SU-8 circular array pattern. The glass substrate with the coils was bonded to the SMA substrate to complete the shearing-motion mechanism. During the bonding process, the SMA actuators were initially elongated by the coil springs. The generated amplitude and force of the fabricated mechanism were characterized when the SMA actuator was heated by applying a pulsed current to be shrank by the shape recovery effect. The fabricated shearing-motion mechanism successfully generated large amplitude of 41 mu m (around 80 mu m in reciprocal motion) and force of 22 mN at a driving frequency of 1 Hz. At 20Hz, an amplitude of 23 mu m and force of 10mN were obtained even though they were reduced owing to the low thermal response. At both driving frequencies, the obtained amplitudes and forces seems to be sufficient for tactile stimulation to finger skin.

There is growing interest in 'New Performance Management', suggesting a shift from an evaluative to a developmental focus. In Australia, little is known about the current utilisation of both 'old' and 'new' practices. Using survey data from Australian Human Resources Institute (AHRI) members we examine the incidence, coverage and perceived effectiveness of 'traditional', 'transitional' and 'new' practices in Australian organisations. Further, since data were gathered during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine the reported effects of pandemic-related disruptions on practice intensity. Although descriptive results suggest that both workforce size and sector may be associated with practice incidence, regression results indicate that sectoral effects are non-significant, and size matters only in relation to traditional practice use. However, our regression results indicate that COVID-19's impact is significantly related to all three practice categories. Furthermore, overall PMS effectiveness is not rated highly.

Here, a new type of organic-inorganic hybrid scintillators containing earth abundant elements that can be prepared via low-temperature processes is reported. With room temperature co-crystallization of an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) organic halide, 4-(4-(diphenylamino) phenyl)-1-(propyl)-pyrindin-1ium bromide (TPA-PBr), and a metal halide, zinc bromide (ZnBr2), a zero-dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrid (TPA-P)(2)ZnBr4 with a yellowish-green emission peaked at 550 nm has been developed. In this hybrid material, dramatically enhanced X-ray scintillation of TPA-P+ is achieved via the sensitization by ZnBr42-. The absolute light yield (14,700 +/- 800 Photons/MeV) of (TPA-P)(2)ZnBr4 is found to be higher than that of anthracene (approximate to 13,500 Photons/MeV), a well-known organic scintillator, while its X-ray absorption is comparable to those of inorganic scintillators. With TPA-P+ as an emitting center, short photoluminescence and radioluminescence decay lifetimes of 3.56 and 9.96 ns have been achieved. Taking the advantages of high X-ray absorption of metal halides and efficient radioluminescence with short decay lifetimes of organic cations, the material design paves a new pathway to address the issues of low X-ray absorption of organic scintillators and long decay lifetimes of inorganic scintillators simultaneously.

J	Song, YX; Li, DY; Xuan, XC				Song, Yongxin; Li, Deyu; Xuan, Xiangchun			Recent advances in multimode microfluidic separation of particles and cells	ELECTROPHORESIS			English	Review						cell separation; hybrid; integrated; microfluidics; particle separation	PINCHED FLOW FRACTIONATION; HYDRODYNAMIC FILTRATION; RARE CELLS; BLOOD; SIZE; DIELECTROPHORESIS; MANIPULATION; MIGRATION; MAGNETOPHORESIS; CLASSIFICATION	Microfluidic separation of particles and cells is crucial to lab-on-a-chip applications in the fields of science, engineering, and industry. The continuous-flow separation methods can be classified as active or passive depending on whether the force involved in the process is externally imposed or internally induced. The majority of current separations have been realized using only one of the active or passive methods. Such a single-mode process is usually limited to one-parameter separation, which often becomes less effective or even ineffective when dealing with real samples because of their inherent heterogeneity. Integrating two or more separation methods of either type has been demonstrated to offer several advantages like improved specificity, resolution, and throughput. This article reviews the recent advances of such multimode particle and cell separations in microfluidic devices, including the serial-mode prefocused separation, serial-mode multistage separation, and parallel-mode force-tuned separation.

Based on previous experimental studies, we developed a serious game aiming to boost letter-speech sound (L-SS) correspondences in a motivational game environment.Objectives: The goal of this study was to determine the efficacy of this game in training L-SS correspondences in pre-readers. Additionally, an extended version of the game was developed given the importance of handwriting in audio-visual integration. We established whether including a motoric component in the game boosted the letter-speech sound training on top of the effect of the game without the motoric component.Methods: One-hundred forty-five kindergartners were randomly allocated to play either the standard audio-visual version of the game, the motoric version or a control math game. All children were pre- and post-tested on L-SS knowledge and reading accuracy.Results and conclusions: We found that playing the game enhanced pre-readers' L-SS knowledge, but not reading accuracy, after a short, intensive intervention period of 3 weeks. However, children who played the motoric version of the game did not differ significantly from either the standard or the control condition.Implications: This game was efficient in training L-SS correspondences in pre-readers. These results suggest that this game might be useful as a preventive evidence-based intervention for at-risk children in kindergarten who might benefit from a head start before learning how to read. Future studies are needed to examine whether a longer intervention period results in L-SS knowledge being translated into reading skills.

However, their characterization and utilization of these enzymes in biotechnological applications have been limited. Here, we characterize a novel bifunctional enzyme, rAbf43A, cloned from a bacterial consortium that exhibits AXH and endo-xylanase activities. Hydrolytic pattern analyses revealed that the AXH activity belongs to AXHd3 because it attacked only the C(O)-3-linked arabinofuranosyl residues of double-substituted xylopyranosyl units of arabinoxylan and arabinoxylan-derived oligosaccharides, which are usually resistant to hydrolysis. The enzyme rAbf43A also liberated a series of xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs) from beechwood xylan, xylohexaose and xylopentaose, indicating that rAbf43A exhibited endo-xylanase activity. Homology modelling based on AlphaFold2 and site-directed mutagenesis identified three non-catalytic residues (H161, A270 and L505) located in the substrate-binding pocket essential for its dual-functionality, while the mutation of A117 located in the -1 subsite to the proline residue only affected its endo-xylanase activity. Additionally, rAbf43A showed significant synergistic action with the bifunctional xylanase/feruloyl esterase rXyn10A/Fae1A from the same bacterial consortium on insoluble wheat arabinoxylan and de-starched wheat bran degradation. When rXyn10A/Fae1A was added to the rAbf43A pre-hydrolyzed reactions, the amount of released reducing sugars, xylose and ferulic acid increased by 9.43% and 25.16%, 189.37% and 93.54%, 31.39% and 32.30%, respectively, in comparison with the sum of hydrolysis products released by each enzyme alone. The unique characteristics of rAbf43A position it as a promising candidate not only for designing high-performance enzyme cocktails but also for investigating the structure-function relationship of GH43 multifunctional enzymes.

However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N-phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P-N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV-1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat-induced activation of HIV-1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein-protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large-scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.

Serum proteome of dogs with chronic enteropathy	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						biomarkers; food-responsive enteropathy; inflammatory bowel disease; proteins; proteomics	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; CANINE; EXPRESSION; DIAGNOSIS; PROTEINS; FLUID; BIOMARKERS; GELSOLIN; CELLS	BackgroundChronic enteropathy (CE) is common in dogs and can occur with multiple etiologies including food-responsive enteropathy (FRE) and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Hypothesis/ObjectiveTo study the protein profile and pathway differences among dogs with FRE, IBD, and healthy controls using serum proteome analysis. AnimalsNine CE dogs with signs of gastrointestinal disease and histologically confirmed chronic inflammatory enteropathy and 16 healthy controls. MethodsA cross-sectional study with cases recruited from 2 veterinary hospitals between May 2019 and November 2020 was performed. Serum samples were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques. ResultsProteomic profiles showed marked variation in relative protein abundances. Forty-five proteins were significantly (P <= .01) differentially expressed among the dogs with CE and controls with >= 2-fold change in abundance. The fold change of dogs with IBD normalized to controls was more pronounced for the majority of proteins than that seen in the dogs with FRE normalized to control dogs. Proteins involving reactive oxygen species, cytokine activation, acute phase response signaling, and lipid metabolism were altered in dogs with CE. Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceCytokine alterations, acute phase response signaling, and lipid metabolism are likely involved in pathogenesis of CE. Although there are insufficient current data to justify the use of proteomic biomarkers for assessment of CE in dogs, our study identifies potential candidates.

The study argues that such practices lead to heightened work demands, which in turn compromise employees' well-being. The study also argues that the negative consequences associated with HPHRP can be ameliorated when employees receive support from their managers. To test the study's moderated mediation model, multisource matched employer-employee data from the Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2011 is used. Results of generalised multilevel structural equation modelling in STATA revealed that the relationship between HPHRP and well-being (anxiety and depression) is mediated by Job demands (JD). Furthermore, the relationship between JD and both anxiety and depression is moderated by Managerial support (MS), such that when the level of MS is high, the positive relationship between HPHRP and both anxiety and depression via JD is weaker. Taken together, the findings of the study advance our understanding of why and when HPHRP may impair employees' well-being.

To determine if this shift to telehealth was associated with a change in clients' counseling service-seeking intentions while adjusting for unmeasured confounders and time trends, we performed a difference-in-difference analysis (a quasi-experimental design) to compare changes between the client (treated) and non-client (control) groups through a large national sample of emerging adults (N = 52,237). The study findings indicated that the shift to telehealth was not associated with a change in clients' counseling service-seeking intentions, providing support for the utility of telehealth counseling. Implications of these findings should be considered when assessing the merit of telehealth counseling to inform public policies and counseling practice in the post-pandemic era.

However, most of the work on robust optical logic devices stays at the theoretical level. There are very few topologically-protected logic devices fabricated in experiments. Here, the experimental fabrication of a series of topologically-protected all-optical logic gates is reported. Seven topologically-protected all-optical logic gates (OR, XOR, NOT, XNOR, NAND, NOR, and AND) are fabricated on silicon photonic platforms, which show strong robustness even if some disorders exist. These robust logic devices are potentially applicable in future optical signal processing and computing applications.

Here we built up a high-density intra/extracellular optophysiology platform, together with developing two probes for specific recognition of L-cysteine (Cys) and dopamine (DA), for simultaneously quantifying of both intracellular Cys and extracellular DA with high selectivity and accuracy across the brain of freely moving animals, as well as recording electrical signals. Using this powerful tool, it was found that intracellular Cys regulated extracellular DA through inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the depressed mice brain. We also established the functional networks of Cys and DA across 32 brain regions in freely moving animals. More importantly, it was discovered that depression reduced the correlations between adjacent brain regions, which was recovered by the treatment of N-acetyl-l-cysteine.

ACTA PSYCHIATRICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						cannabis; clinical course; psychosis; schizophrenia; symptoms	FOLLOW-UP; RISK; SYMPTOMS; METAANALYSIS; PSYCHOSIS; OUTCOMES; BRAIN; AGE	Introduction: While evidence strongly supports a causal effect of cannabis on psychosis, it is less clear whether the symptom pattern, clinical course, and outcomes differ in cases of schizophrenia with and without a background of cannabis use. Methods: Analysis of medical records from a longitudinal follow-up of Swedish conscripts with data on cannabis use in adolescence and subsequent incidence of schizophrenia. One hundred sixty patients with schizophrenia were assessed using the OPCRIT protocol. Cases were validated for diagnosis schizophrenia according to OPCRIT. Results: Patients with a cannabis history (n = 32), compared to those without (n = 128), had an earlier age at onset, a higher number of hospital admissions and a higher total number of hospital days. There was no significant difference in type of onset and clinical symptom profiles between the groups. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the disease burden of schizophrenia is greater in individuals who use cannabis during adolescence. Strengthening evidence on causality and teasing out long-term effects of pre-illness cannabis use from continued post-illness has clinical implications for improving schizophrenia outcomes.

Biventricular cardiac power reserve in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEART FAILURE			English	Article; Early Access						Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; Biventricular cardiac power output; Cardiopulmonary exercise testing	PROGNOSTIC VALUE; EXERCISE; OUTPUT; MORTALITY; PRESSURE; VOLUME	AimsCardiac and extracardiac abnormalities play important roles in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Biventricular cardiac power output (BCPO) quantifies the total rate of hydraulic work performed by both ventricles, suggesting that it may help to identify patients with HFpEF and more severe cardiac impairments to better individualize treatment.Methods and resultsPatients with HFpEF (n = 398) underwent comprehensive echocardiography and invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Patients were categorized as low BCPO reserve (n = 199, < median of 1.57 W) or preserved BCPO reserve (n = 199). As compared to those with preserved BCPO reserve, those with low reserve were older and leaner, with more atrial fibrillation, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, worse renal function, more impaired left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain, worse LV diastolic function and right ventricular longitudinal function. Cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures at rest were higher in low BCPO reserve, but central pressures were similar during exercise to those with preserved BCPO reserve. Exertional systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were higher and exercise capacity was more impaired in those with low BCPO reserve. Reduced BCPO reserve was associated with increased risk for the composite endpoint of heart failure hospitalization or death over 2.9 (interquartile range 0.9-4.5) years of follow-up (hazard ratio 2.77, 95% confidence interval 1.73-4.42, p < 0.0001).ConclusionsInability to enhance BCPO during exercise is associated with more advanced HFpEF, increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, reduced exercise capacity and increased adverse events in patients with HFpEF. Novel therapies that enhance biventricular reserve merit further investigation for patients with this phenotype.

J	Barros, M; Dimla, E				Barros, Mario; Dimla, Eric			Smartphone repairability indexes in practice: Linking repair scores to industrial design features	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						circular economy; Index of Repairability; industrial ecology; policy analysis; product design; smartphones	CONSUMPTION	Policymaking mediates the relationships between manufacturers and consumers, thus defining the boundaries for the philosophies of production set forth by major companies. Research states that policymaking falls short in addressing the waste issues, natural resources consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and other negative impacts posed by premature obsolescence; only recently have the "right-to-repair" guidelines demanded by environmental organizations and communities of citizens been included in policymaking. The introduction of the Index of Repairability in France as information at the point of sale aims to inform consumers and support their decision-making in purchasing more repairable products. In this paper, we consider the two Indexes of Repairability publicly available to consumers-in the French legislation and iFixit-and assess their application to smartphones from three manufacturers. The study establishes links between the scores and the industrial design features that promote or hinder repairability, service factors and information for self-repair, authorized repair, and independent repair. Data collection considers the available information for consumers and citizens by using netnography and secondary data from manufacturers, policymakers, and communities of users. Our findings suggest that higher scores that indicate easier repairability are not limited to product architectures that follow design for disassembly guidelines. Smartphones that are difficult to repair can still score high, and thus be perceived as easier to repair, if manufacturers provide high quality and affordable service. This paper discusses the results of the ongoing development of repairability scores for smartphones, thus suggesting paths for future research to improve methods and policies to support a longer lifetime of products.

We also identify three channels: what we call a 'maturation effect', double-track communication and watch-dog function. We argue that these results are consistent with the idea that the impact of workplace unions on training depends on the empowerment of its collective voice within an institutional framework that does not fit either of the standard models provided by collective and liberal market economies.

The influence of risk awareness and government trust on risk perception and preparedness for natural hazards	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article; Early Access						preparedness intention; risk awareness; risk perception	FLOOD RISK; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; COEFFICIENT ALPHA; VOLCANIC RISK; ADJUSTMENT; MODEL; COMMUNITIES; MANAGEMENT; REGION	Risk perception is considered the primary motivator for taking preparedness actions. But people with prior experience and a high-risk perception are not necessarily more prepared. This relationship is even more complex when assessing preparedness levels for hazards with different characteristics. These inconsistent findings can be explained by how preparedness has been measured and the influence of other factors, such as trust and risk awareness. Thus, the main goal of this study was to analyze the role of risk awareness and trust in authorities on risk perception and intention to prepare for natural hazards in a coastal city in Chile. A representative sample of the city of Concepcion, located in the center-south zone of Chile (n = 585), completed a survey. We measured risk awareness, risk perception, trust in authorities, and intention to prepare for two hazards: earthquakes/tsunamis and floods. Through structural equation models, we tested five hypotheses. We found that the perception of risk maintained a direct and positive influence on the intention to prepare for both hazards. The results showed that awareness and risk perception influence the intention to prepare and should be considered different concepts. Finally, trust did not significantly influence risk perception when faced with known hazards for the population.

An easy dilute-and-shoot approach has been used for sample preparation with a dilution factor of 5. Improved retention of ionic and highly polar compounds has been achieved by the addition of tetrabutylammonium bromide as an ion pair reagent into the final diluted sample. The new nanoflow liquid chromatography method has demonstrated low matrix effects (70%-111%), high sensitivity in terms of limits of quantification (0.005 to 0.3 mu g/L), low injection volume (70 nl) and solvent consumption, and the ability to analyze diverse polar and ionic analytes within one run using a single reversed-phase nanoflow liquid chromatography column. Wastewater samples (n = 116) from the wastewater treatment plants of different cities in Latvia were analyzed using the developed method. The observed concentrations of biomarkers were in line with the literature data.

The energy band of such materials depends strongly on their structures, and a tremendous variation in their physical properties can be deduced from a tiny change in inter-layer spacing, twist angle, or in-plane strain. In this work, a kind of vdW layered material of spiral antimonene is constructed, and the strain effects in the material are studied. The spiral antimonene is grown on a germanium (Ge) substrate and is induced by a helical dislocation penetrating through few atomic-layers of antimonene (beta-phase). The as-grown spiral is intrinsically strained, and the lattice distortion is found to be pinned around the dislocation. Both spontaneous inter-layer twist and in-plane anisotropic strain are observed in scanning tunneling microscope (STM) measurements. The strain in the spiral antimonene can be significantly modified by STM tip interaction, leading to a variation in the surface electronic density of states (DOS) and a large modification in the work function of up to a few hundreds of millielectron-volts (meV). Those strain effects are expected to have potential applications in building up novel piezoelectric devices.	[Huang, Ding-Ming; Chang, Kai; Xu, H.

Although physiological low-level ROS are known to be important as signalling molecules, the role of stretch-induced ROS in the intact myocardium remains unclear. To address this, we investigated the effects of stretch-induced ROS on myocardial cellular contractility and calcium transients in C57BL/6J and NOX2(-/-) mice. Axial stretch was applied to the isolated cardiomyocytes using a pair of carbon fibres attached to both cell ends to evaluate stretch-induced modulation in the time course of the contraction curve and calcium transient, as well as to evaluate maximum cellular elastance, an index of cellular contractility, which is obtained from the end-systolic force-length relationship. In NOX2(-/-) mice, the peak calcium transient was not altered by stretch, as that in wild-type mice, but the lack of stretch-induced ROS delayed the rise of calcium transients and reduced contractility. Our mathematical modelling studies suggest that the augmented activation of ryanodine receptors by stretch-induced ROS causes a rapid and large increase in the calcium release flux, resulting in a faster rise in the calcium transient. The slight increase in the magnitude of calcium transients is offset by a decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium content as a result of ROS-induced calcium leakage, but the faster rise in calcium transients still maintains higher contractility. In conclusion, a physiological role of stretch-induced ROS is to increase contractility to counteract a given preload, that is, it contributes to the Frank-Starling law of the heart.

However, LL and OS measurement errors because of pelvic positional changes have not been described. This study aimed to clarify the effects of pelvic positional changes on LL and OS measurements in relation to the pelvic reference using a THA simulator. Methods: We developed an experimental THA simulator using Sawbones models of the hemipelvis and femur that facilitated modification of the obliquity, tilt, and rotation of the pelvis. Using an LL and OS caliper, LL and OS measurement errors due to pelvic positional changes were determined with the femoral position fixed. Measurements were performed from two pelvic reference positions: the iliac tubercle (P1) and the top of the iliac crest intersecting the line of the femoral long axis (P2). Results: Concerning pelvic obliquity, the total error of LL was 25.0 mm in P1 and 26.5 mm in P2, while the total error of OS was 13.0 mm in P1 and 10.9 mm in P2. For pelvic tilt, the total error of LL was 9.0 mm in P1 and 3.8 mm in P2, while the total error of OS was 0.5 mm in P1 and 1.0 mm in P2. Regarding pelvic rotation, the total error of LL was 13.8 mm in P1 and 3.2 mm in P2, while the total error of OS was 3.8 mm in P1 and 4.0 mm in P2. Conclusions: Pelvic positional changes alter LL and OS measurements. The acceptable range (error <2 mm) on LL and OS measurement errors of pelvic obliquity was only 2 degrees, regardless of the pelvic reference position. The pelvic reference position should be at the top of the iliac crest intersecting the line of the long axis of the femur because of a small LL measurement error with pelvic tilt and rotation.

We aimed to investigate a more appropriate method for AT--III concentrate administration to maintain plasma AT--III activity level within the target range. In this randomized controlled trial, 130 adult patients undergoing living--donor liver transplantation were randomized to either the intermittent group or continuous group. In the intermittent group, 500 international units (IU) of AT--III concentrate were administered after liver transplantation and repeated every 6 h for 72 h. In the continuous group, 3000 IU of AT--III were continuously infused for 71 h after a loading dose of 2000 IU over 1 h. Plasma AT--III activity level was measured at 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 h from the first AT--III administration. The primary outcome was the target (80%--120%) attainment rate at 72 h. Target attainment rates at other timepoints and associated complications were collected as secondary outcomes. A total of 107 patients were included in the analysis. The target attainment rates at 72 h post--dose were 30% and 62% in the intermittent group and continuous group, respectively (p = 0.003). Compared to the intermittent group, patients in the continuous group reached the target level more rapidly (12 vs. 24 h, median time, p < 0.001) and were more likely to remain in the target range until 84 h. For maintaining the target plasma AT--III activity level after living-donor liver transplantation, continuous infusion of AT--III seemed to be more appropriate compared to the conventional intermittent infusion regimen.

However, inefficient charge separation and transfer greatly limits the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Herein, single-atom Pt anchored on 3D hierarchical TiO2-Ti3C2 with atomic-scale interface engineering is successfully synthesized through an in situ transformation and photoreduction method. The in situ growth of TiO2 on Ti3C2 nanosheets can not only provide interfacial driving force for the charge transport, but also create an atomic-level charge transfer channel for directional electron migration. Moreover, the single-atom Pt anchored on TiO2 or Ti3C2 can effectively capture the photogenerated electrons through the atomic interfacial Pt-O bond with shortened charge migration distance, and simultaneously serve as active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the atomic interface engineering of single-atom Pt and interfacial Ti-O-Ti, the optimized photocatalyst exhibits excellent CO2-to-CO conversion activity of 20.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) with a selectivity of 96%, which is five times that of commercial TiO2 (P25). This work sheds new light on designing ideal atomic-scale interface and single-atom catalysts for efficient solar fuel conversation.

Polycardanol′s potential to deasphalt crude oil: Influence of polymer conversion degree, molar mass, and structure	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Early Access						cardanol; deasphalting; flocculation; phase behaviour; polycardanol	ASPHALTENE PRECIPITATION; CARDANOL; DEPOSITION; STABILIZATION; DISPERSANTS; RESERVOIRS	Cardanol is a natural material that acts to stabilize asphaltenes in crude oil. However, its derivative, polycardanol, obtained via cationic polymerization, has divergent behaviour, with reports of its acting both as asphaltenes stabilizer and flocculant. Recently, it was demonstrated that the reaction conditions influence the conversion rates, structures, and molar masses of the products from synthesizing polycardanol initiated with BF3 center dot O(C2H5)(2). Seeking to elucidate the influence of these variables on the phase behaviour of asphaltenes, in this work six products, previously synthesized and characterized, had their performance evaluated by asphaltenes precipitation onset, using n-heptane titration and monitoring by near-infrared spectroscopy, using asphaltenes model systems (C5I and C7I) at 1.00 wt./vol.% in toluene. All the products had the ability to flocculate asphaltenes and have potential for deasphalting process. Flocculation efficiency increased with rising molar mass, higher reaction conversion degree, and presence of lateral hydrocarbon chains. The most efficient structures were not affected by the presence of unreacted cardanol. This indicated that the reaction does not require a purification step. Aged cardanol was also able to produce flocculant polymer, indicating that the distillation of cardanol is not required. The cost to obtain a product without needing reagent distillation becomes lower.

In comparison with micro-LEDs whose external quantum efficiency is dependent on the mesa size, these RGB nanowire LEDs are more efficient than micro-LEDs when the chip size is below 20, 80, and 10 mu m, respectively. As a result, nanowire LED is a promising candidate for augmented reality and virtual reality displays where high-resolution density and efficient directional light emission are desired.

Association between gut permeability, brain volume, and cognition in healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						bacterial translocation; brain volume; microbiome-gut-brain axis; MRI; schizophrenia spectrum disorders	LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-BINDING PROTEIN; NEUROINFLAMMATION; ACTIVATION; TRANSLOCATION; INFLAMMATION; DEPRESSION; MARKERS; OBESITY	IntroductionThe barrier function of the gut is important for many organs and systems, including the brain. If gut permeability increases, bacterial fragments may enter the circulation, giving rise to increased systemic inflammation. Increases in bacterial translocation are reflected in higher values of blood markers, including lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and soluble cluster of differentiation 14 (sCD14). Some pioneer studies showed a negative association between bacterial translocation markers and brain volumes, but this association remains scarcely investigated. We investigate the effect of bacterial translocation on brain volumes and cognition in both healthy controls and patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). Materials and methodsHealthy controls (n = 39) and SSD patients (n = 72) underwent an MRI-scan, venipuncture and cognition assessments. We investigated associations between LBP and sCD14 and brain volumes (intracranial volume, total brain volume, and hippocampal volume) using linear regression. We then associated LBP and sCD14 to cognitive function using a mediation analysis, with intracranial volume as mediator. ResultsHealthy controls showed a negative association between hippocampal volume and LBP (b = -0.11, p = .04), and intracranial volume and sCD14 (b = -0.25, p = .07). Both markers were indirectly associated with lower cognitive functioning in healthy controls (LBP: b = -0.071, p = .028; sCD14: b = -0.213, p = .052), mediated by low intracranial volume. In the SSD patients, these associations were markedly less present. ConclusionThese findings extend earlier studies suggesting that increased bacterial translocation may negatively affect brain volume, which indirectly impacts cognition, even in this young healthy group. If replicated, this finding stresses the importance of a healthy gut for the development and optimal functioning of the brain. Absence of these associations in the SSD group may indicate that other factors such as allostatic load, chronic medication use and interrupted educational carrier had larger impact and attenuated the relative contribution of bacterial translocation.

In this study, we examined the susceptibility of multiple field populations of two thrips pests, Frankliniella occidentalis, and Thrips palmi, that often co-occur on vegetables, to nine insecticides belonging to seven subgroups. RESULTSThe highest level of variation in susceptibility among F. occidentalis populations was for spinetoram (73.92 fold difference between most resistant and most susceptible population), followed by three neonicotinoids (8.06-15.99 fold), while among T. palmi populations, it was also for spinetoram (257.19 fold), followed by emamectin benzoate, sulfoxaflor, and acetamiprid (23.64-45.50 fold). These findings suggest evolved resistance to these insecticides in some populations of the two thrips. One population of F. occidentalis had a particularly high level of resistance overall, being the most resistant for five of the nine insecticides tested. Likewise, a population of T. palmi had high resistance to all nine insecticides, again suggesting the evolution of resistance to multiple chemicals. For F. occidentalis, the LC95 values of most populations were higher than the field-recommended dosage for all insecticides except chlorfenapyr and emamectin benzoate. For several T. palmi populations, the LC95 values also tended to be higher than recommended dosages, except in the case of emamectin benzoate and spinetoram. CONCLUSIONSOur study found interspecific and intraspecific variations in the susceptibility of two thrips to nine insecticides and multiple resistance in some populations, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and resistance management.

Subjects and MethodsReferences on genetic diseases with dentin malformations were obtained from various sources, including PubMed, OMIM, NCBI, and other websites. The clinical phenotypes and genetic backgrounds of these diseases were then summarized, analyzed, and compared. ResultsOver 10 systemic diseases, including osteogenesis imperfecta, hypophosphatemic rickets, vitamin D-dependent rickets, familial tumoral calcinosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia, hypophosphatasia, Elsahy-Waters syndrome, Singleton-Merten syndrome, odontochondrodysplasia, and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II were examined. Most of these are bone disorders, and their pathogenic genes may regulate both dentin and bone development, involving extracellular matrix, cell differentiation, and metabolism of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D. The phenotypes of these syndromic dentin defects various with the involved genes, part of them are similar to dentinogenesis imperfecta or dentin dysplasia, while others only present one or two types of dentin abnormalities such as discoloration, irregular enlarged or obliterated pulp and canal, or root malformation. ConclusionSome specific dentin defects associated with systemic diseases may serve as important phenotypes for dentists to diagnose. Furthermore, mechanistic studies on syndromic dentin defects may provide valuable insights into isolated dentin defects and general dentin development or mineralization.

Chia (<i>Salvia hispanica</i> L.) can directly suppress basic ovarian cell functions in two farm animal species and protect ovarian cells from the proliferation-stimulating influence of xylene	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article						apoptosis; chia; hormones; ovarian granulosa cells; proliferation; xylene	QUERCETIN; CONTAMINANTS; EXPOSURE	The influence of the functional food plant chia (Salvia hispanica L.) on reproduction functions and its ability to prevent the negative effects of environmental contaminants has not yet been studied. Our study aimed to examine the effect of chia seed extract alone and in combination with xylene on the markers of proliferation, apoptosis and hormones release by cultured bovine and porcine ovarian granulosa cells. The extract of chia reduced all of the measured parameters in bovine and porcine ovarian cells but had no effect on the proliferation of porcine cells. Xylene, stimulated proliferation and IGF-I release and inhibited the release of progesterone and testosterone but not apoptosis of bovine granulosa cells. It promoted proliferation, apoptosis and progesterone output by porcine cells. Chia mitigated the stimulatory effect of xylene on proliferation but not on other parameters in both species. The present results are the first demonstration of a direct effect of chia on basic ovarian cell functions. They confirmed a direct influence of xylene on these functions and found a similar stimulatory action of xylene on bovine and porcine ovarian cell proliferation. The present observations demonstrated species-specific differences in the characteristics of xylene influences on ovarian cell apoptosis and secretory activity. Finally, the present results indicate that chia can be a natural protector against the proliferation-stimulating effects of xylene on ovarian cells in both species.

Lymph Node Follicle-Targeting STING Agonist Nanoshells Enable Single-Shot M2e Vaccination for Broad and Durable Influenza Protection	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						follicular dendritic cells; germinal center; lymph node follicle targeting; matrix protein 2 ectodomain antigen; nanoshell; stimulator of interferon genes agonist; universal influenza vaccine	EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; MATRIX PROTEIN-2; GERMINAL CENTER; VACCINES; ANTIBODY; MACROPHAGES; COMPLEMENT; INFECTION	The highly conserved matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) of influenza viruses presents a compelling vaccine antigen candidate for stemming the pandemic threat of the mutation-prone pathogen, yet the low immunogenicity of the diminutive M2e peptide renders vaccine development challenging. A highly potent M2e nanoshell vaccine that confers broad and durable influenza protectivity under a single vaccination is shown. Prepared via asymmetric ionic stabilization for nanoscopic curvature formation, polymeric nanoshells co-encapsulating high densities of M2e peptides and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists are prepared. Robust and long-lasting protectivity against heterotypic influenza viruses is achieved with a single administration of the M2e nanoshells in mice. Mechanistically, molecular adjuvancy by the STING agonist and nanoshell-mediated prolongation of M2e antigen exposure in the lymph node follicles synergistically contribute to the heightened anti-M2e humoral responses. STING agonist-triggered T cell helper functions and extended residence of M2e peptides in the follicular dendritic cell network provide a favorable microenvironment that induces Th1-biased antibody production against the diminutive antigen. These findings highlight a versatile nanoparticulate design that leverages innate immune pathways for enhancing the immunogenicity of weak immunogens. The single-shot nanovaccine further provides a translationally viable platform for pandemic preparedness.	[Tsai, Hsiao-Han; Lin, Leon C.

A spear and shield-inspired Ar plasma emergeed through a plasma ball mill to prevent Ar@BP nanosheets from oxidation compared with the preparation of BP nanosheets (MBPNSs) in a mechanical ball mill. The absorption coefficient in the synchrotron radiation spectrum is increased by 16.91%, indicating that BP is effectively protected by Ar proof. The Vienna ab initio simulation reveals that the combination of Ar@BP with oxygen cannot proceed spontaneously with the binding energy of 4.44 eV. With the introduction of 1.5 wt% Ar@BP, the total heat release (THR), total smoke release (TSR), total smoke production(TSP), CO, and CO2 yield, compared with that of EP, are descended by 30.40%, 24.41%, 24.10%, 33.23%, and 37.60%, respectively, indicating excellent flame retardancy property. It is attributed to the condensed and gas phase function. Meanwhile, the tensile strength and elongation at break increase by 27.92% and 56.04%, respectively, with the incorporation of 1.5 wt% Ar@BP.

Bioactive glass (BG) is a clinically approved bone graft material and has been shown to modulate inflammatory response, but it is unknown whether BG can be applied to treat IBD. Here, it is reported that BG attenuates pro-inflammatory response of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages and hence reduces inflammatory damage to intestinal organoids in vitro. In addition, zein/sodium alginate-based core-shell microspheres (Zein/SA/BG) are developed for oral delivery of BG, which helps prevent premature dissolution of BG in the stomach. The results show that Zein/SA/BG protects BG from a gastric-simulated environment while dissolved in an intestinal-simulated environment. When administered to acute and chronic colitis mice model, Zein/SA/BG significantly reduces intestinal inflammation, promotes epithelial tissue regeneration, and partially restores microbiota homeostasis. These findings are the first to reveal the therapeutic efficacy of BG against IBD, which may provide a new therapeutic approach at low cost for effective IBD treatment.

However, the widespread use of this technology is constrained by the relatively low-cost performance of materials. Developing environmentally friendly thermoelectrics with high performance and earth-abundant elements is thus an urgent task. MnTe is a candidate, yet a peak ZT of 1.4 achieved so far is less satisfactory. Here, a remarkably high ZT of 1.6 at 873 K in MnTe system is realized by facilitating multiple valence band convergence and localized lattice engineering. It is demonstrated that Sb-Ge incorporation promotes the convergence of multiple electronic valence bands in MnTe. Simultaneously, the carrier concentration can be optimized by Sb-Ge-S alloying, which significantly enhances the power factor. Simultaneously, MnS nanorods combined with dislocations and lattice distortions lead to strong phonon scattering, resulting in a markedly low lattice thermal conductivity(kappa(lat)) of 0.54 W m K-1, quite close to the amorphous limit. As a consequence, extraordinary thermoelectric performance is achieved by decoupling electron and phonon transport. The vast increase in ZT promotes MnTe as an emerging Pb-free thermoelectric compound for a wide range of applications in waste heat recovery and power generation.

Consequently, an increasing percentage of reported organ donors are also SARS-CoV-2 positive. Although donors may not have experienced COVID-19-related symptoms, there is a chance of unnoticed cardiovascular effects associated with this disease. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 donor grafts have been regularly rejected for heart transplantation (HTx) for a long time. We hereby present three consecutive patients receiving grafts from SARS-CoV-2 positive donors (defined by the PCR cycle threshold value < 30). All patients underwent HTx after a previous triple mRNA vaccination (mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine, Comirnaty) without adverse events and with a regular post-operative course. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance and endomyocardial biopsies confirmed excellent graft function without signs of rejection or viral myocarditis. After a mean follow-up of 135 days after HTx, all patients were in good conditions without heart failure, viral myocarditis, or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, we conclude that HTx with SARS-CoV-2 positive donors seems safe and feasible.

In this work, through systematic investigations on topological properties of isolated Weyl phonons (IWPs) surrounded by closed Weyl nodal walls (WNWs), which are located at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundaries of bosonic systems, it uncovers that a new kind of phononic surface state, that is, the multi-fold fan-shape surface state named by us, is exhibited to connect the projections of IWP and WNWs. Importantly, the number of fan leaves in this surface state is associated with the Chern number of IWP. Moreover, the topological features of charge-two IWP in K2Mg2O3 (SG No. 96) and charge-four IWP in Nb3Al2N (SG No. 213) confirm further the above fundamental properties of this kind of surface state. The theoretical work not only provides an effective way to seek for IWPs as well as to determine their Chern number in real materials, but also uncovers a new class of surface states in the topological Weyl complex composed of IWPs and WNWs.

The propositive study: Immunogenicity and safety of a four-component recombinant protein-based vaccine against MenB and a quadrivalent conjugate MenACWY vaccine in people living with HIV	HIV MEDICINE			English	Article						HIV; meningococcal disease; vaccines	INVASIVE MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE; B VACCINE; 4CMENB; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SEROGROUP; CHILDREN; RISK	Background: People living with HIV have been shown to have an increased risk of invasive meningococcal disease. In some countries, meningococcal vaccines are now routinely recommended to all people living with HIV, but no study has yet assessed the immunogenicity and safety of a meningococcal serogroup B vaccine or the co-administration of a MenB and MenACWY vaccine in people living with HIV.Methods: This phase IV open-label clinical trial investigated the immunogenicity and safety of two doses of a four-component recombinant protein-based MenB vaccine (4CMenB) and a quadrivalent conjugate polysaccharide MenACWY vaccine (MenACWY-CRM197) given 1 month apart in a population of people living with HIV. Immunogenicity analysis was performed before vaccination and 1 month after the second doses of 4CMenB and MenACWY. Primary outcome measures were serum bactericidal assay geometric mean titres against three MenB reference strains at baseline and 1 month post vaccination, the proportion of participants achieving a putative protective titre of =4, and the proportion of participants with a =4-fold rise in titre from baseline. Secondary outcome measures were serum bactericidal assay geometric mean titres against MenA, C, W, and Y reference strains at baseline and 1 month post vaccination, the proportion achieving a putative protective titre of =8, and the proportion with a =4-fold rise in titre from baseline. Safety outcomes were solicited and unsolicited adverse events in the 7 days following vaccination. The trial was registered with (NCT03682939).Findings: In total, 55 participants aged 20-45 years were enrolled. All participants (100%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 93-100) achieved putative protective titres for two of the three MenB strains and for MenA, W, and Y. A total of 98% (95% CI 89-100) achieved a protective titre for the third MenB strain and 94% (95% CI 83-99) for MenC. No serious adverse events were reported.Interpretation: 4CMenB and MenACWY were immunogenic and well-tolerated in a population of people living with HIV 1 month after two doses.

In a recent article published in BIRTH: Issues in Perinatal Care, Bogdan-Lovis et al. surveyed 200 Black women to determine whether they possessed a race and gender practitioner preference for their birth practitioner and examined whether race and gender concordance was associated with greater birth satisfaction and perceived respect, trust, practitioner competence, empathy, and use of inclusive communication. In this commentary, written by a group of Black midwives, we respond to the study and offer a vision for race-concordant care that encompasses cultural safety provided in a community-based setting.

However, conventional hydrogels with insufficient mechanical strength and poor fatigue resistance are damaged or lose service stability when subjected to alternating stress. Herein, self-reinforced hydrogels are fabricated from elaborately designed ionic conductive hydrogels after repetitive sweat soak-dehydration (SSD) treatment. The tensile strength of self-reinforced hydrogels is improved to 930 from 480 kPa and exhibits insensitivity to crack propagation in any direction after 6 SSD treatment cycles. In addition, the self-reinforced hydrogels show excellent skin friendliness compared with commercial wearable materials in a skin-compatibility mouse model. Bringing together those advantages, various skin-contactable flexible electronics are fabricated utilizing the self-reinforced hydrogels and an emergency alarming system for acute myocardial infarction caused cardiogenic shock is also integrated that is expected to help potential patients in accidents.

Despite growing scholarly interest in the configurational approach, little is known about how moderation functions in conjunctural causation. Although there is a growing urgency for elucidating the boundary conditions of conjunctural causation to bolster the precision of theoretical explanations, a systematic approach to theorising, identifying, and interpreting moderation in configurational theories is missing. To bridge this knowledge gap, we first establish the theoretical grounding for moderation in the configurational approach. We then articulate the theoretical mechanism underlying how the interdependence of causal factors in a causal recipe is altered by the presence of a moderator. We also offer guidance on how to validate and interpret moderation in the configurational approach based on Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We conduct an illustrative study in the context of technostress to showcase the utility of our proposed guidelines and their value in aiding theory development. Our study hence contributes to extant literature by attesting to the significance of moderation in the configurational approach and offering recommendations for theorising such moderations. Insights from this study can be harnessed to guide future theory development by identifying and validating moderated configurational relationships, which in turn can further enhance our understanding of nuances in multifaceted digital phenomena.

Specifically, we implemented sequence analysis to discover common course-taking trajectories in math, science, and English language arts using high school transcript data from a recent nationally representative survey. Through sequence clustering, we reduced the complexity of the sequences and examined representative course-taking sequences. Classification tree, random forests, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between the course sequences students complete and their postsecondary outcomes. Results showed that distinct representative course-taking sequences can be identified for all students as well as student subgroups. More advanced and complex course-taking sequences were associated with postsecondary enrollment.

Wearable mechano-electric pressure sensors that mount on the skin are promising candidates for monitoring continuous blood pressure (BP) pulse waveforms due to their excellent conformability, simple sensing mechanisms, and convenient signal acquisition. However, it is challenging to acquire high-fidelity BP pulse waveforms since it requires highly sensitive sensors (sensitivity larger than 4 x 10(-5) kPa(-1)) that respond linearly with pressure change over a large dynamic range, covering the typical BP range (5-25 kPa). Herein, this work introduces a high-fidelity, iontronic-based tonometric sensor (ITS) with high sensitivity (4.82 kPa(-1)), good linearity (R-2 > 0.995), and a large dynamic range (up to 180% output change) over a broad working range (0 to 38 kPa). Additionally, the ITS demonstrates a low limit of detection at 40 Pa, a fast load response time (35 ms) and release time (35 ms), as well as a stable response over 5000 load per release cycles, paving ways for potential applications in human-interface interaction, electronic skins, and robotic haptics. This work further explores the application of the ITS in monitoring real-time, beat-to-beat BP by measuring the brachial and radial pulse waveforms. This work provides a rational design of a wearable pressure sensor with high sensitivity, good linearity, and a large dynamic range for real-time CNIBP monitoring.

Recent works reveal that the interlayer DMI is beneficial to designing 3D chiral spin textures that possess fundamental importance and the associated technological promises. Here, the interlayer DM constants are determined quantitatively in synthetic ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt/Ru/Pt/Co/Ta structures. The results demonstrate that the interlayer DMI shows uniaxial anisotropic characteristics. The first-principles calculations elucidate that the anisotropic interlayer DMI is induced by the in-plane symmetry breaking along two high symmetric directions, which favors the magnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic layers canting in different directions. The anisotropic interlayer DMI is also confirmed by spin-orbit torque driven asymmetric magnetization switching. Moreover, the interlayer DMI can be tuned by the Ru-layer-thickness and beneficial to designing 3D spin textures for future spintronic devices.

A body of research has demonstrated that lncRNAs have a regulatory function in human diseases, especially cancers. ZEB2-AS1 is known as an oncogenic lncRNA in various types of cancers, and its deregulation may contribute to cancer development and progression. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the association of ZEB2-AS1 expression with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, as a hallmark of cancer progression, in a clinical setting. MethodsA recent study suggested that ZEB2-AS1 is significantly involved in EMT. Here we intended to explore the roles of lncRNA ZEB2-AS1 in breast cancer (BC) using bioinformatics tools and laboratory settings. We first evaluated the expression of ZEB2-AS1 mRNA in tumor and healthy control tissues by lnCAR database. Furthermore, ZEB2-AS1 expression level, ZEB2, E-cadherin, and vimentin was measured via qRT-PCR in 30 paired ductal and lobular carcinoma tissues from breast cancer patients and the normal adjacent ones. The correlation between the lncRNA ZEB2-AS1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of the breast cancer patients was evaluated. ResultsZEB2-AS1 showed an upregulation in breast cancer tissues (p = .04) compared to normal adjacent samples. In addition, its level was higher in breast cancer patients with advanced Stages (III & IV) (n = 18) compared to early Stages (I & II) (n = 12) (p = .04). Moreover, ZEB2 (p = .01) and vimentin (p = .02) expression were upregulated in the BC sample, but the expression level of E-cadherin (p = .02) was downregulated when compared with the adjacent normal tissues. By comparison of the expression of EMT-markers between different stages of breast cancer, overexpression of ZEB2 (p = .04) and vimentin (p = .04) and down expression of E-cadherin (p = .03) was observed in advance stages. ConclusionsCollectively, our findings suggest that ZEB2-AS1 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues, especially in advanced stages and ZEB2-AS1 is associated with the aggressiveness of tumors by functioning as putative oncogenic lncRNA. In addition, a combination of ZEB2-AS1 and these EMT markers in breast cancer potentiates these genes as biomarkers for tumor progression.

Geological age and environments shape reef habitat structure	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article; Early Access						coral reef; environmental drivers; habitat complexity; structural complexity; structure-from-motion	FRACTAL DIMENSIONS; FISH DIVERSITY; CORAL-REEFS; COMPLEXITY; ABUNDANCE; ECOSYSTEMS; LIDAR; RUGOSITY	Aim: Habitat complexity plays an important role in the structure and function of ecosystems worldwide. On coral reefs, habitat complexity influences ecosystem ser- vices such as harvestable fish biomass and attenuation of wave energy. Here, we test how three descriptors of surface complexity- rugosity, fractal dimension, and height range- trend with the geological age of reefs (0.2- 5.1 million years old), depth (1- 25 m), wave exposure (1- 306 kW/m), coral cover (0- 80%), and three habitat types (aggregated reef, rock and boulder, and pavement). Location: We surveyed across 234 sites and 4 degrees of latitude in the eight main Hawaiian Islands.Time Period: April 2019 - July 2019. Major Taxa Studied: Reef building corals. Methods: We estimate three surface descriptors (rugosity, fractal dimension and height range) using structure- from-motion photogrammetry. We evaluate hypothesized relationships between these descriptors and geological reef age, depth, wave exposure, coral cover and reef habitat type using generalized linear models that ac- count for survey design.Results: The rugosity of reef habitats decreased with geological reef age; fractal di- mension (and coral cover) decreased with wave exposure; and height range decreased with depth. Variations in these patterns were explained by the different habitat types and the way they are formed over time. Nonetheless, the three surface descriptors were geometrically constrained across all habitat types, and so habitats occupied dis- tinctly different regions of habitat complexity space. Main Conclusions: This study showed how broad environmental characteristics influ- ence the structural complexity of habitats, and therefore geodiversity, which is an im- portant first step toward understanding the communities supported by these habitats and their ecosystem services.

However, there is a limited understanding of its antecedents, complementors' evaluation of antecedents and the manifestations and dynamic changes of complementors' engagement. Therefore, we investigate complementors' engagement within platform ecosystems over time. We draw on actor and stakeholder engagement from service research to conceptualise complementor engagement (CE) and create an integrated empirical understanding of CE and its dynamics in digital platform ecosystems. Our embedded case study builds on 30 interviews with complementors in Anubis and Osiris enterprise software platform ecosystems. Inductive data analysis reveals five CE antecedents: platform resources and rules, platform value proposition, platform agents, customer needs and other complementors' value propositions. The antecedents are associated with three CE behaviours: generating, networking and synchronising. Further analysis of CE over time resulted in 26 different sequences representing stable and changing engagement trajectories, the latter comprising selective, growing and abating engagement as subcategories. We show how complementors' evaluations of antecedents lead to behaviour changes, providing a novel perspective on the dynamics underlying CE.

J	He, ZZ; Wang, HS; Pan, P				He, Zhizhou; Wang, Haishen; Pan, Peng			A model-driven method based on multisource data for reproducing displacement time history	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						displacement estimation; model-driven; multisource data; optimization algorithm; shaking table test	DAMAGE	The seismic displacement time history of a structure is very important for damage assessment. This paper proposes a displacement estimation method based on multisource measurement data. In this method, the structure is simplified to a mass-spring shear model, where a set of tunable parameters are assigned. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to search for the optimal values of the parameters, and the objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the difference between the measured roof response and that calculated by the model. A refined finite element model was established in ABAQUS, and the numerical calculation results were used to verify this proposed method. Results show that the estimation error of the maximum inter-story drift ratio among all floors is 8.9%, and the average error of the maximum displacement of each floor is 7.0%, representing a satisfactory estimation effectiveness. The source of the errors is discussed, and we find that this method is more suitable for low-rise buildings. Shaking table tests of a scaled four-story reinforced concrete (RC) frame were conducted, and the estimation error of the maximum inter-story drift ratio among all floors was 6.1%, indicating the feasibility of this method in practice.

To achieve cost-effective operations, low noble metal loading on the anode catalyst layer is desired. In this study, a catalyst with RuO2 nanorods coated outside SnO2 nanocubes is designed, which forms continuous networks and provides high conductivity. This allows for the reduction of Ru contents in catalysts. Furthermore, the structure evolutions on the RuO2 surface are carefully investigated. The etched RuO2 surfaces are seen as the consequence of Co leaching, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that it is more effective in driving oxygen evolution. For electrochemical tests, the catalysts with 23 wt% Ru exhibit an overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much higher than most state-of-art oxygen evolution catalysts. In a practical PEMWE, the noble metal Ru loading on the anode side is only 0.3 mg cm(-2). The cell achieves 1.61 V at 1 A cm(-2) and proper stability at 500 mA cm(-2), demonstrating the effectiveness of the designed catalyst.

However, few of perovskite-based photodetectors focus on ultraviolet-visible-short-wavelength infrared (UV-Vis-SWIR) broadband photodetection because of the relatively large bandgap. Moreover, such broadband photodetectors with individual nanocrystal channel featuring monolithic integration with functional electronic/optical components have hardly been explored. Herein, an individual monocrystalline MAPbBr(3) nanoplate-based photodetector is demonstrated that simultaneously achieves efficient UV-Vis-SWIR detection and fast-response. Nanoplate photodetectors (NPDs) are prepared by assembling single nanoplate on adjacent gold electrodes. NPDs exhibit high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and detectivity of 1200% and 5.37 x 10(12) Jones, as well as fast response with rise time of 80 mu s. Notably, NPDs simultaneously achieve high EQE and fast response, exceeding most perovskite devices with multi-nanocrystal channel. Benefiting from the high specific surface area of nanoplate with surface-trap-assisted absorption, NPDs achieve high performance in the near-infrared and SWIR spectral region of 850-1450 nm. Unencapsulated devices show outstanding UV-laser-irradiation endurance and decent periodicity and repeatability after 29-day-storage in atmospheric environment. Finally, imaging applications are demonstrated. This work verifies the potential of perovskite-based broadband photodetection, and stimulates the monolithic integration of various perovskite-based devices.

Recent studies have suggested their potential use as anticancer agents, making them an area of interest for further research. The review aims to summarize the current understanding of the potential anticancer effects of Angelica species and to provide insights for further research in this area. We searched for "Angelica" related information on Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley, Science Citation Index Finder, and Springer link by searching keywords such as "Angelica," "Angelica phytochemical," "Angelica antitumor effect," "Angelica molecular mechanisms," and "Angelica clinical application." Included articles focused on the Angelica plant's anticancer properties and clinical studies, while non-cancer-related biological or phytochemical investigations were excluded. We conducted a comprehensive search of books, journals, and databases published between 2001 and 2023, identifying 186 articles for this narrative review. The articles were analyzed for their potential anticancer properties and therapeutic applications. Active compounds in the Angelica genus, such as coumarins, furanocoumarins, phthalides, and polysaccharides, exhibit anticancer properties through various mechanisms. Specific species, like A. archangelica, Angelica sinensis, A. gigas, and A. ksiekie, have the potential as anticancer agents by targeting cellular pathways, generating reactive oxygen species, and inducing apoptotic cell death. Further research into the properties of the Angelica genus is needed for developing new treatments for cancer. Phytochemicals from Angelica species possess potential as anticancer agents, requiring further research for the development of effective, low-cost, and low-toxicity cancer treatments compared to synthetic antitumor drugs.

We propose that firms headquartered in the politicians' hometowns tend to reduce their philanthropic investment because identification with their hometown activates the politicians' tendency to extend political legitimacy to hometown firms. Analysing a large sample of publicly listed Chinese firms for 2003-2015, we demonstrate that hometown firms evade their social responsibility by taking advantage of the incumbent provincial political leader's "home bias". We also find that such a "home bias" effect exists when the political leader comes into power and disappears after the leader leaves office. Further analyses show that the firms' political dependency strengthens the "home bias" effect, so that firms in sensitive industries, with greater financial resources and private ownership, are more likely to evade their social engagement by taking advantage of the politicians' hometown favouritism. Our study highlights the critical role of hometown connections in corporate social responsibility in the Chinese relationship-based business system. It also advances a normative institutional assessment of hometown-based favouritism by highlighting its distinct dynamics and impacts on focal firms' social decision-making.

Here, a novel thermal-driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TD-TENG) is developed, which utilizes a bimetallic beam with a bi-stable dynamic feature to induce continuous mechanical oscillations, and the mechanical motion is then converted into electric power using a contact-separation TENG. The thermal process inside the device is systematically investigated and effective thermal management is conducted accordingly. After optimization, the TD-TENG can produce a power density of 323.9 mW m(-2) at 59.5 degrees C, obtaining the highest record of TENG-based thermal energy harvesters. Besides, the first prototype of TENG-based solar thermal harvester is successfully demonstrated, with a power density of 364.4 mW m(-2). Moreover, the TD-TENG can harvest and dissipate the heat at the same time, exhibiting great potential in over-heated electronics protection as well as architectural energy conservation. Most importantly, the operation temperature range of the TD-TENG is tunable by adjusting the bimetal parameters, allowing the device a wide and flexible working thermal gradient.

Scattering data with such an extended q-range enables the recovery of the underlying real-space atomic pair distribution function, which facilitates structure determination. We demonstrate the potential of this method for biomacromolecules using several types of cyclodextrins (CD) as model systems. We successfully identified deviations of the tilting angles for the glycosidic units in CDs in aqueous solutions relative to their values in the crystalline forms of these molecules. Such level of structural detail is inaccessible from standard small angle scattering measurements. Our results call for further exploration of ultra-wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements for biomacromolecules.

In this work, with the combination of experiment and finite element simulation, a facile strategy based on sandwich structure is proposed to eliminate the skin layer. The simulation results indicate that removing skin layers can increase the water flux of porous membranes by more than 4 times. In experiment, first the formation mechanism of skin layer is studied for the porous membranes fabricated from poly(ether-ether-ketone)/poly(ether-imide) (PEEK/PEI) blend based on crystallization template. It is found that the stronger interaction between PEI and the polyimide releasing film during hot-pressing is the cause of the PEEK skin layers of the obtained membranes. According to this mechanism, a skin-free PEEK membrane is prepared from the PEI/(PEEK/PEI blend)/PEI sandwich structure. The separation test indicates that the PEEK membrane fabricated following the new strategy has remained rejection ratio and enhanced flux by 3-5 times as the simulation result predicts. Furthermore, the universality of developed sandwich strategy has been validated in polyformaldehyde/poly(L-lactic acid) (POM/PLLA) blend (crystalline/crystalline system). Our results provide a novel solution to regulate the skin layer of porous membranes.

Although PDL therapy, albeit on a modest scale, is being used for decades now, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the long-term remission of psoriasis remain poorly understood. The selective and rapid absorption of energy by the blood causes heating of the vascular wall and surrounding structures, like perivascular nerves. Several studies indicate the importance of nerves in psoriatic inflammation. Interestingly, denervation leads to a spontaneous remission of the psoriatic lesion. Among all dermal nerves, the perivascular nerves are the most likely to be affected during PDL treatment, possibly impairing the neuro-inflammatory processes that promote T-cell activation, expression of adhesion molecules, leukocyte infiltration and cytokine production. Repeated PDL therapy could cause a prolonged loss of innervation through nerve damage, or result in a 'reset' of neurogenic inflammation after temporary denervation. The current hypothesis provides strong arguments that PDL treatment affects nerve fibres in the skin and thereby abrogates the persistent and exaggerated inflammatory process underlying psoriasis, causing a long-term remission of psoriasis.

Materials and MethodsThirty patients (aged 9-13 years) with UCLP having a GOSLON score 3 were selected for this prospective clinical study. The patients were allocated into two groups using computer generated random number table. Group I (facemask therapy along with two I shaped miniplates, FM + MP) and Group II (facemask mask along with tooth-anchored appliance, FM). Skeletal and dental parameters were evaluated on pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms and pharyngeal airway on cone-beam computed tomography systems (CBCT) for assessment of the treatment changes. ResultsBoth methods proved to be effective with statistically significant improvements in skeletal and dental parameters (p < .05). Skeletal parameters (e.g., SNA, convexity-point A, ANB) with the FM + MP group showed greater change compared to those with FM group (SNA, 2.56 degrees; convexity-point A, 1.22 degrees; ANB, 0.35 degrees). Significant proclination of maxillary incisors was observed in the FM group as compared to FM + MP group (U1 to NA, 5.4 degrees; 3.37 mm). A statistically significant increase in pharyngeal airway volume was noted in both groups (p < .05). ConclusionWhile both therapies are effective in protracting the maxilla in growing patients with UCLP, the FM + MP allows for a greater skeletal correction, minimizing the dental side effects seen with FM therapy alone. Thus, FM + MP appears to be a promising adjunct in reducing the severity of Class III skeletal correction needed in patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP).

However, the half-open battery structure and the high concentration of alkaline aqueous environment pose great challenges on the electrolyte retention capability and the zinc anode stability. Herein, a starch-based superabsorbent hydrogel polymer electrolyte (SSHPE) with high ionic conductivity, electrolyte absorption and retention capabilities, strong alkaline resistance and high zinc anode stability has been designed and applied in ZABs. Experimental and calculational analyses probe into the root of the superiority of SSHPEs, confirming the significance of the carboxyl functional groups along their polymer chains. These features endow the as-fabricated ZAB a long cycle life of 300 h, much longer than that with commonly used poly(vinyl alcohol)-based electrolyte.

The Si3N4 samples used for database were fabricated using various kinds of sintering additives under different process conditions. In total, 330 data sets were prepared and used for building the CNN models for artificial intelligence-bassed determination of the two mechanical properties and testing the determination accuracy of the trained models. The determination coefficients (R-2), which were used as accuracy indices, were approximately 0.85 for K-IC and 0.92 for sigma. Although both the R-2 values were relatively high, the lower value for K-IC suggests that it is influenced more by what is little obtained from the microstructural information, such as grain-boundary characteristics. Furthermore, gradient-weighted class activation mapping, which can visualize which parts of the image the CNN models focus on, showed that the trained models determined the two mechanical properties based on correct recognition of the microstructural difference among the images.

While each histological subtype correlates with a distinct prognosis, the molecular basis has not been fully elucidated. Here we conducted DNA methylation analysis of 30 lung adenocarcinoma cases annotated with the predominant histological subtypes and three normal lung cases using the Infinium BeadChip. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three subgroups with different methylation levels: high-, intermediate-, and low-methylation epigenotypes (HME, IME, and LME). Micropapillary pattern (MPP)-predominant cases and those with MPP components were significantly enriched in HME (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). HME cases showed a significantly poor prognosis for recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001) and overall survival (p = 0.006). We identified 365 HME marker genes specifically hypermethylated in HME cases with enrichment of "cell morphogenesis" related genes; 305 IME marker genes hypermethylated in HME and IME, but not in LME, with enrichment "embryonic organ morphogenesis"-related genes; 257 Common marker genes hypermethylated commonly in all cancer cases, with enrichment of "regionalization"-related genes. We extracted surrogate markers for each epigenotype and designed pyrosequencing primers for five HME markers (TCERG1L, CXCL12, FAM181B, HOXA11, GAD2), three IME markers (TBX18, ZNF154, NWD2) and three Common markers (SCT, GJD2, BARHL2). DNA methylation profiling using Infinium data was validated by pyrosequencing, and HME cases defined by pyrosequencing results also showed the worse recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, lung adenocarcinomas are stratified into subtypes with distinct DNA methylation levels, and the high-methylation subtype correlated with MPP-predominant cases and those with MPP components and showed a poor prognosis.

Modified Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) Is an Alternative to Safranin O for Discriminating Bone-Cartilage Interfaces	JBMR PLUS			English	Article						BONE AND CARTILAGE; GROWTH PLATE; HISTOLOGY; HISTOMORPHOMETRY; STAINING METHODS	ARTICULAR-CARTILAGE; DECALCIFICATION; GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS; PROTEOGLYCANS; MATRIX	Cartilage histomorphometry is often performed on decalcified, paraffin-embedded bone sections, which provide versatility in staining applications from basic morphology to immunohistochemistry. Safranin O is a cationic dye that binds to proteoglycans in cartilage and is routinely used to assess growth plate dynamics and/or fracture repair at bone-cartilage interfaces. When used with a counterstain such as fast green, safranin O can offer exquisite differentiation of cartilage from surrounding bone. However, various decalcification and processing methods can deplete proteoglycans, rendering inconsistent, weak, or absent safranin O staining with indiscriminate bone-cartilage boundaries. We sought to develop an alternative staining methodology that preserves the contrast of bone and cartilage in cases of proteoglycan depletion that can be applied when other cartilage stains are unsuccessful. Here, we describe and validate a modified periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) protocol that we developed using Weigert's iron hematoxylin and light green stains as an alternative to safranin O for discriminating bone-cartilage interfaces of skeletal tissues. This method provides a practical solution for differentiating bone and cartilage when safranin O staining is not detected after decalcification and paraffin processing. The modified PAS protocol can be useful for studies in which identification of the bone-cartilage interface is essential but may not be preserved with standard staining approaches.

Some children may require alleviation of symptoms and overall attention. AimTo assess parents' beliefs in and attitudes toward teething. DesignThrough electronic databases and gray literature, this systematic review identified cross-sectional studies reporting parents' beliefs in, knowledge about, and attitudes toward the signs and symptoms of primary tooth eruption in children aged between 0 and 36 months. Three reviewers independently selected the studies, collected the information, assessed methodological quality, and checked for accuracy with disagreements solved by a fourth reviewer. The Agency of Research and Quality in Health questionnaire for cross-sectional studies was used for quality assessment. Descriptive analysis with median and interquartile ranges was adopted. ResultsTwenty-nine studies comprising 10 524 participants from all geographic regions were included. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate. Most parents have beliefs in signs and symptoms during dentition, the most reported symptom being the desire to bite. Oral rehydration was the most exposed attitude in the studies included. Only a small proportion of parents reported no attitude. ConclusionsThe majority of parents believed in at least one sign or symptom associated with teething, and only few of them would do nothing or just wait for the signs or symptoms to pass, with no difference among countries (Protocol doi: 10.17605/OSF.IO/S2KZ3).

Evaluation of a rapid immunoassay for bacteriuria in dogs	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						bacteriuria; RapidBac; RIA; urinary tract infection	URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION; DIAGNOSIS	BackgroundThe ability to detect bacteriuria in dogs with a point-of-care test might improve medical care and antimicrobial stewardship. Hypothesis and ObjectiveA rapid immunoassay (RIA; RapidBac) will provide acceptable sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of bacteriuria. AnimalsForty-four client-owned dogs with a clinical indication for urinalysis and aerobic bacterial urine culture. MethodsProspective study. Urine, collected by cystocentesis, was submitted for urinalysis and culture at a diagnostic laboratory. Owners completed an enrollment questionnaire regarding their dogs' clinical signs. The RIA was performed according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Results were compared to culture. ResultsForty-four urine specimens were evaluated from 44 dogs. The sensitivity and specificity of the RIA test to detect bacteriuria compared to urine culture were 81.8% (95% CI, 65.7%-97.9%) and 95.5% (95% CI, 86.8%-99.9%), respectively. For cultures yielding >= 10(3) CFU/mL, sensitivity increased to 90.0% (95% CI, 76.9%-100%) and specificity was similar at 95.2% (95% CI, 86.1%-99.9%). Malodorous urine, bacteriuria, and pyuria were more likely to be present in dogs with positive RIA or urine culture results compared to dogs with negative results. Conclusions and Clinical ImportanceThe RIA was easy to perform and had good sensitivity and excellent specificity in this group of dogs. The RIA might be a useful screening test for decision-making regarding antimicrobial therapy in dogs with a clinical indication for urine culture. Consideration could be given to amending the International Society for Companion Animal Infectious Disease definition of bacterial cystitis as the presence of signs of lower urinary tract disease together with positive culture or a positive RIA.

Understanding the acceptability and adoption of a health promotion intervention can provide insights into intervention fidelity and future scalability.Methods: In total, 13 HCPs were interviewed. Data were analysed thematically through an abductive approach using Sekhon et al.'s theoretical framework of acceptability and Greenhalgh et al.'s framework for non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability.Results: Acceptability and adoption of the intervention among HCPs were influenced by (1) skills and technology, (2) values, and (3) organisation. The intervention was experienced as acceptable to HCPs because the dialogue tool, visualising different topics, used in the home visits and digital coaching through the LIVA app were flexible and enabled them to address psychosocial health and personalise goal setting in families. However, delivering asynchronous and non-verbal communication was experienced as straining HCPs' relationship with families, which misaligned with HCPs' values. Establishing a non-judgemental environment was needed to increase intervention acceptability among HCPs towards addressing type 2 diabetes risk after GDM. Increased collaboration between HCPs may have aligned advice and support to families and could have benefitted delivery.Conclusions: When delivering health promotion to women with prior GDM, flexible intervention components that support psychosocial- and mental health topics may increase acceptability and adoption of the intervention among HCPs. HCPs' skills, values, and organisational factors should be considered prior and during implementation.

MethodsClinical samples of transplanted liver tissues from 26 patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) and normal liver tissues from seven patients undergoing hepatic hemangiomactomy (Con) were collected. Typical samples were subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes between groups were identified by DEGseq and were analyzed by enrichment analysis including Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and gene set enrichment analysis. Transcription of five lncRNAs including NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, NONHSAG027516, LXLOC_058190, and LXLOC_024376 that presented significant difference in RNA-sequencing were validated by a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), for which the subcellular localization and the binding ability to known human RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were respectively predicted by LncLocator and catRAPID genomics v2.1. ResultsWe identified 2917 lncRNAs and 2811 mRNAs that were differentially expressed (p < 0.05 and log(2) fold change > 1 or < -1) between groups (LT vs. Con). NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, LXLOC_058190, and LXLOC_024376 were validated by qRT-PCR to be significantly increased in the LT group, and were all predicted to be localized in cytoplasm or cytosol. NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, and LXLOC_058190 held an RBP interaction propensity score of 98.07%, 76.95%, and 152.99%, respectively, with heterogeneous-nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU). Pathways significantly activated in transplant livers that involved HNRNPU as a core enrichment gene included hypoxia, ACE2 expression, apoptosis, spliceosome formation, etc. ConclusionsNONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, and LXLOC_058190 were significantly increased in transplant livers after reperfusion and their role in HIRI may be associated with HNRNPU, a core protein that participates in hypoxia and chromatin accessibility.

There is a need for a reliable risk stratification tool among these patients for the selection of ideal candidates of curative resection.Purpose: To determine the clinicoradiological prognostic factors for patients with MHCC beyond the Milan criteria to further develop a stratification system.Study Type: Retrospective.Subjects: 176 patients with pathologically confirmed MHCC beyond the Milan criteria.Field Strength/Sequence: The 1.5 T scanner, including T1-, T2-, diffusion-weighted imaging, in/out-phase imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging.Assessment: Conventional MRI features and preoperative laboratory data including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and a-fetoprotein (AFP) were collected and analyzed. Two nomograms incorporating clinicoradiological variables were independently constructed to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) with Cox regression analyses and verified with 5-fold cross validation. Based on the nomograms, two prognostic stratification systems for RFS and OS were further developed.Statistical Tests: The Cohen's kappa/intraclass correlation coefficient, C-index, calibration curve, Kaplan-Meier curve, log rank test. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: AST > 40 U/L, increased tumor burden score, radiological liver cirrhosis and nonsmooth tumor margin were independent predictors for poor RFS, while AST > 40 U/L, AFP > 400 ng/mL and radiological liver cirrhosis were independent predictors for poor OS. The two nomograms demonstrated good discrimination performance with C-index of 0.653 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.602-0.794) and 0.685 (95% CI, 0.623-0.747) for RFS and OS, respectively. The 5-fold cross validation further validated the discrimination capability of the nomograms. Based on the nomogram models, MHCC patients beyond the Milan criteria were stratified into low-/medium-/high-risk groups with significantly different RFS and OS.Data Conclusion: The proposed MRI-based prognostic stratification system facilitates the refinement and further subclassification of patients with MHCC beyond the Milan criteria.

Two groups were determined based on discharge date: "discharged by postoperative Day 2" and "discharged after postoperative Day 2." Univariable and multivariable analysis were conducted to identify predictors for discharge. Using propensity score matching (PSM) to compare 30-day readmission rate between two cohorts.Results: A total of 1911 patients were discharged by postoperative Day 2. Multivariable analysis identified older age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.014, p < 0.001), male sex (OR = 1.183, p = 0.003), larger tumor size (OR = 1.248, p < 0.001), pleural adhesions (OR = 1.638, p = 0.043), lymph nodes calcification (OR = 1.443, p = 0.009), advanced clinical T stage (vs. T < 2, OR = 1.470, p = 0.010), lobectomy resection (vs. segmentectomy resection, OR = 2.145, p < 0.001) and prolonged operative time (OR = 1.011, p < 0.001) as independent risk factors for discharge after postoperative Day 2. Three adjustable variables including higher FEV1/FVC (OR = 0.989, p = 0.001), general anesthesia (GA) plus thoracic paravertebral blockade (vs. GA alone, OR = 0.823, p = 0.006) and uni-portal thoracoscopic surgery (vs. multi-portal, OR = 0.349, p < 0.001) were associated with a decreased likelihood of discharge after postoperative Day 2. Before and after a 1:1 PSM, discharged by postoperative Day 2 did not increase the risk of 30-day readmission compared to counterparts.Conclusions: Carefully selected patients can be safely discharged within 2 days after thoracoscopic anatomic lung cancer surgery. Three modifiable variables may be favorable for promoting discharge by postoperative Day 2.

However, the clinicopathological and biological significance of HOOK1 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains rarely studied. In this study, the authors demonstrate that HOOK1 is downregulated in RCC samples with predicted poorer clinical prognosis. Mechanistically, HOOK1 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis via canonical TGF-beta/ALK5/p-Smad3 and non-canonical TGF-beta/MEK/ERK/c-Myc pathway. At the same time, HOOK1 inhibits RCC angiogenesis and sunitinib resistance by promoting degradation of TNFSF13B through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In addition, HOOK1 is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear factor E2F3 in VHL dependent manner. Notably, an agonist of HOOK1, meletin, is screened and it shows antitumor activity more effectively when combined with sunitinib or nivolumab than it is used alone. The findings reveal a pivotal role of HOOK1 in anti-cancer treatment, and identify a novel therapeutic strategy for renal cell carcinoma.

To understand the deep crustal structure of the extension of the Sulu orogenic belt in the Yellow Sea, we presented a 220-km long active-source ocean-bottom seismometer wide-angle reflection/refraction profile across the Yellow Sea. The obtained P-wave velocity structure exhibits significant horizontal and vertical variations. The middle and upper crustal regions of the north beneath the survey line exhibit a higher velocity and larger thickness than those of the south, whereas the opposite is the case with the lower crust. The lower crustal high-velocity zone in the Northern Depression of the South Yellow Sea Basin is a manifestation of the mantle material upwelling and accretion to the lower crust. Magmatic intrusions occurred along the faults and formed a high-velocity zone in the middle and upper crusts. Due to undulating Moho interface and varying crustal velocities, the Qingdao-Rongcheng fault is identified as a fault in the Sulu orogenic belt without the significance of tectonic zoning. This study shows that the Sino-Korean Block, Sulu orogenic belt and South China Block are bounded by the Jimo-Muping faults (an extension to the sea), Qianliyan fault and deep fault of the South Yellow Sea. Furthermore, the Sulu orogenic belt may have been formed by the northward subduction of the South China Block beneath the Sino-Korean Block during the Indosinian orogeny to the east of the Shandong Peninsula.

Recently, efforts have been made to develop a strategy for reusing industrial byproducts, such as RM, and turning waste into value-added products. The use of RM as (i) a supplementary cementitious material for construction and building materials, such as cement, concrete, bricks, ceramics, and geopolymers, and (ii) a catalyst is discussed in this review. Furthermore, the physical, chemical, mineralogical, structural, and thermal properties of RM, as well as its environmental impact, are also discussed in this review. It is possible to conclude that using RM in catalysis, cement, and construction industries is the most efficient way to recycle this byproduct on a large scale. However, the low cementitious properties of RM can be attributed to a reduction in the fresh and mechanical properties of composites incorporating RM. On the other hand, RM can be used as an efficient active catalyst to synthesize organic molecules and reduce air pollution, which not only makes use of solid waste but also lowers the price of the catalyst. The review provides basic information on the characterization of RM and its suitability in various applications, paving the way for more advanced research on the sustainable disposal of RM waste. Future research perspectives on the utilization of RM are also addressed.

Herein, voltage loss analysis of Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 solar cells fabricated at three institutions with variation in process, bandgap, absorber structure, postdeposition treatment (PDT), and efficiency is presented. Nonradiative voltage losses due to Shockley-Read-Hall charge carrier recombination dominate and constitute >75% of the total compared to <25% from radiative voltage losses. The radiative voltage loss results from nonideal absorption and carriers in band tails that stem from local composition-driven potential fluctuations. It is shown that significant bulk lifetime improvements are achieved for all alkali PDT processed absorbers, chiefly associated with reductions in nonradiative recombination. Primary voltage loss contributions (radiative and nonradiative) change little across fabrication processes, but variation in submechanisms (bulk lifetime, net acceptor concentration, and interface recombination) differentiate nonradiative loss pathways in this series of solar cells.

Sequence-defined approaches provide a solution for precise control of the primary macromolecular structure. Despite a growing interest, very few examples for applications of sequence-defined macromolecules exist. In particular, the use of sequence-defined macromolecules as printable materials remains unexplored. Herein, the rational design of precise macromolecular inks for 3D microprinting is investigated for the first time. Specifically, three printable oligomers are synthesized, consisting of eight units, either crosslinkable (C) or non-functional (B) with varied sequence (BCBCBCBC, alternating; BBCCCBB, triblock; and BBBBCCCC, block). The oligomers are printed using two-photon laser printing and characterized. It is clearly demonstrated that the macromolecular sequence, specifically the positioning of the crosslinkable group, plays a critical role in both the printability and final properties of the printed material. Thus, through precise design and printability of sequence-defined macromolecules, an exciting avenue for the next generation of functional materials for 3D printing is created.

An immunohistochemistry examination was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue samples from both groups to understand whether there was a relationship between EP and STC. Staining results of the polyp and control groups for STC-1 and STC-2 were compared, and it was investigated whether STCs were predictive for EP.Results: In the comparison performed between the H-score evaluation results of the control and polyp groups after the immunohistochemical staining method, the staining in the polyp group was significantly higher for both STC-1 (p < 0.001) and STC-2 (p < 0.001). There was more staining with STC-1 than STC-2 in all groups (STC-1: 15.08; STC-2: 8.27; p < 0.05). In the logistic regression analysis established with STC-1, STC-2, and age, the predictive effect of STC-1 for EP was statistically significant (p = 0.040; odds ratio: 1.66; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-2.68). In EP, according to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, area under the curve was 0.980 (likelihood ratio: 20.35; p < 0.05), and the cut-off value was 18 for STC-1.Conclusion: In infertile patients, since STC-1, which affects endometrial receptivity, is found to be significantly higher in polyps and has a predictive effect on polyps, in patients with unexplained infertility, routine uterine cavity evaluation and routine excision of polypoid lesions detected during this period may have a positive effect on endometrial receptivity.

NGAL has not yet been investigated in equine asthma (EA). ObjectivesTo investigate the ability of NGAL concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum to distinguish between control horses, horses with mild-moderate EA (MEA) and horses with severe EA (SEA). Study designRetrospective cross-sectional study. MethodsDetails of endoscopic examination including tracheal mucus score (TMS, scale 0-5) and BAL cytology performed on 227 horses were extracted from records and NGAL concentrations were measured on stored serum and BAL fluid samples. The horses were divided into groups (control group n = 73, MEA n = 98, SEA n = 56) based on clinical signs and BAL cytology results. Differences between groups were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test and correlation between BAL NGAL, serum NGAL, and BAL cytology were evaluated using Spearman's correlation. ResultsBAL NGAL concentrations were higher in EA than in control horses (median: 25.6 and 13.3 mu g/L, respectively, p < 0.001). Concentrations of NGAL in BAL differed between groups, with higher concentrations in MEA than in control horses (median: 18.5 and 13.3 mu g/L, respectively, p < 0.001), and higher concentrations in SEA than in MEA horses (median: 54.1 and 18.5 mu g/L, respectively, p < 0.001). BAL NGAL concentration differed between horses with TMS <= 2 an >2 (median 15.6 and 21.1 mu g/L, respectively, p = 0.004). No differences were found in serum NGAL concentration between any of the groups. Main limitationOnly 66 of the 227 (29%) horses had haematology and serum NGAL measured. ConclusionBAL NGAL concentration differed between control and EA and reflected severity of disease. These results justify further research into the potential of NGAL as a biomarker of EA.

In the previous work, it is reported that CAR-NK targeting of HLA-G can be used to treat certain solid tumors. However, the frequent co-expression of PD-L1 and HLA-G) and up-regulation of PD-L1 after adoptive immunotherapy may decrease the effectiveness of HLA-G-CAR. Therefore, simultaneous targeting of HLA-G and PD-L1 by multi-specific CAR could represent an appropriate solution. Furthermore, gamma-delta T (gamma delta T) cells exhibit MHC-independent cytotoxicity against tumor cells and possess allogeneic potential. The utilization of nanobodies offers flexibility for CAR engineering and the ability to recognize novel epitopes. In this study, V delta 2 gamma delta T cells are used as effector cells and electroporated with an mRNA-driven, nanobody-based HLA-G-CAR with a secreted PD-L1/CD3 epsilon Bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) construct (Nb-CAR.BiTE). Both in vivo and in vitro experiments reveal that the Nb-CAR.BiTE-gamma delta T cells could effectively eliminate PD-L1 and/or HLA-G-positive solid tumors. The secreted PD-L1/CD3 epsilon Nb-BiTE can not only redirect Nb-CAR-gamma delta T but also recruit un-transduced bystander T cells against tumor cells expressing PD-L1, thereby enhancing the activity of Nb-CAR-gamma delta T therapy. Furthermore, evidence is provided that Nb-CAR.BiTE redirectes gamma delta T into tumor-implanted tissues and that the secreted Nb-BiTE is restricted to the tumor site without apparent toxicity.

To avoid the sole dependence on SG for bioenergy production, evaluation of other crops to diversify the pool of feedstock is needed. We conducted a 3-year field experiment evaluating eastern gamagrass (GG), another WSPG, as complementary feedstock to SG in one- and two-cut systems, with or without intercropping with crimson clover or hairy vetch, and under different nitrogen (N) application rates. Our results showed that GG generally produced lower biomass (by 29.5%), theoretical ethanol potential (TEP, by 2.8%), and theoretical ethanol yield (TEY, by 32.9%) than corresponding SG under the same conditions. However, forage quality measures, namely acid detergent fiber (ADF), crude protein (CP), and elements P, K, Ca, and Mg were significantly higher in GG than those in SG. Nitrogen fertilizer significantly enhanced biomass (by 1.54 Mg ha(-1)), lignin content (by 2.10 g kg(-1)), and TEY (787.12 L ha(-1)) in the WSPGs compared to unfertilized treatments. Intercropping with crimson clover or hairy vetch did not significantly increase biomass of the WSPGs, or TEP and TEY in unfertilized plots. This study demonstrated that GG can serve as a complementary crop to SG and could be used as a dual-purpose crop for bioenergy and forage feedstock in farmers' rotations.

We aimed to describe the extent and pattern of missing HRQoL data in intensive care trials and describe how these data and deaths were handled statistically. MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following a published protocol. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane Library for RCTs involving adult ICU patients reporting HRQoL as an outcome and excluded RCTs unobtainable in full text. We performed risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. ResultsWe included 196 outcomes from 88 RCTs published in the years 2002-2022; the numbers of patients alive and eligible to respond HRQoL were reported in 76% of trials. At follow-up, median 27% (interquartile range 14%-39%) of patients had died, and median 20% (9%-38%) of survivors did not respond across outcomes. Analyses of 80% of outcomes were restricted to complete cases only. The handling of non-survivors in analyses were reported for 46% of outcomes, with 26% of all outcomes reported as including non-survivors (using the value zero or the worst possible score). ConclusionFor HRQoL outcomes in ICU trials, we found that mortality at time of follow-up was high and non-response among survivors frequent. The reporting and statistical handling of these issues were insufficient, which may have biased results.

IntroductionIncreasing nurse turnover is still a major concern in the global healthcare system. The most reliable indicator of turnover is turnover intention. It is crucial to understand its affecting elements to suggest measures to lower nurses' turnover intention. BackgroundTurnover intention has been linked to career calling and missed nursing care. Little empirical research has investigated the possibility that missed nursing care mediates between career calling and turnover intention. MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 347 nurses was conducted. The survey instruments included the General Information Questionnaire, Calling Scale, Missed Nursing Care Scale and Turnover Intention Questionnaire. Structural equation models were used to build the model. This study made use of the STROBE checklist. ResultsFor 43.8% of nurses, turnover intention was high or very high. Missed nursing care and turnover intention were negatively correlated with career calling. Missed nursing care and turnover intention were positively related. Missed nursing care mediated the relationship between career calling and turnover intention. DiscussionCareer calling and missed nursing care can both influence turnover intention. Career calling can reduce the likelihood of turnover by preventing missed nursing care. ConclusionMissed nursing care mediated the relationship between career calling and intention to leave. Implications for nursing and nursing policyNursing managers should improve nurses' career calling through professional education and minimize missed nursing care by using electronic nursing reminder devices to reduce turnover intention.

The structure of SEP was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the compatibility of the curing system was studied by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). DMA and SEM results showed that after curing with epoxy curing agent, the compatibility of the curing system was excellent. The mechanical, bonding, and thermal properties of the cured product were also measured. The cured product exhibited superior thermal stability and mechanical properties. High toughness of SEP was provided by the long silicone chain, and high mechanical strength was provided by the cross-linking networks. The maximum tensile strength was 15.64 MPa, the maximum elongation at break was 62%, and the maximum tensile lap-shear strength was 8.89 MPa. The silicone-epoxy polymers can be widely used in electronic packaging in the future.

Scan methods for spatial social network hotspot detection	TRANSACTIONS IN GIS			English	Article; Early Access							REGIONALIZATION; ASSOCIATION; STATISTICS; MODULARITY; CLUSTERS; DISTANCE; PATTERN	GIS analyses use moving window methods and hotspot detection to identify point patterns within a given area. Such methods can detect clusters of point events such as crime or disease incidences. Yet, these methods do not account for connections between entities, and thus, areas with relatively sparse event concentrations but high network connectivity may go undetected. We develop two scan methods (i.e., moving window or focal processes), EdgeScan and NDScan, for detecting local spatial-social connections. These methods capture edges and network density, respectively, for each node in a given focal area. We apply methods to a social network of Mafia members in New York City in the 1960s and to a 2019 spatial network of home-to-restaurant visits in Atlanta, Georgia. These methods successfully capture focal areas where Mafia members are highly connected and where restaurant visitors are highly local; these results differ from those derived using traditional spatial hotspot analysis using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Finally, we describe how these methods can be adapted to weighted, directed, and bipartite networks and suggest future improvements.

As one of the main pathogens of hyalohyphomycosis, Purpureocillium lilacinum (former Paecilomyces lilacinus) is known for its intrinsic resistance to various antifungal agents. Here, we report three cases that coincide with a history of farming and all of them suffered from cutaneous hyalohyphomycosis caused by P. lilacinum. They shared a clinical presentation consisting of erythematous-to-violaceous painful plaques with overlying pustules on one of their forearms. Hyphae and fungal elements were highlighted by periodic acid Schiff or Gomori methenamine silver staining in their skin biopsies. Fungal cultures of their skin tissues yielded P. lilacinum, which was confirmed by both morphological and molecular characteristics. All patients responded well to oral terbinafine or itraconazole treatment. In this report, we also reviewed previously reported cases associated with either P. lilacinum or other Paecilomyces spp. infections in Taiwan.

This hypothesis assumes that specialized pathogenic and mutualistic fungal communities gradually assemble over time, enhancing plant growth more in species-rich than in species-poor plots. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to characterize root-associated fungal communities in experimental grasslands of 1 and 15 years of age with varying levels of plant species richness. Specifically, we tested whether the relationship between fungal communities and plant richness and productivity becomes stronger with the age of the experimental plots. Our results showed that fungal diversity increased with plant diversity, but this relationship weakened rather than strengthened over the two time points. Contrastingly, fungal community composition showed increasing associations with plant diversity over time, suggesting a gradual build-up of specific fungal assemblages. Analyses of different fungal guilds showed that these changes were particularly marked in pathogenic fungi, whose shifts in relative abundance are consistent with the pathogen dilution hypothesis in diverse plant communities. Our results suggest that root-associated fungal pathogens play more specific roles in determining the diversity-productivity relationship than other root-associated plant symbionts.

Two diodes and two capacitors comprise the VMC, employed to reach high voltage gain. Consequently, the conduction loss is minimized by using a low voltage rated switch with lower R-DS(on). Due to the coupled inductor's leakage inductance, the output diodes' reverse recovery trouble is solved. Moreover, the passive clamp technique stores and recycles leakage energy at the output. The proposed DC-DC converter features are high conversion ratio, low maximum voltage on semiconductors, remarkable efficiency, the existence of only one active low voltage switch, and simple circuit topology with common ground between the input and the output. This paper outlines CCM, BCM, and DCM's operating concept and steady-state analysis in great detail. Furthermore, the suggested structure's capability is indicated by mathematical analysis and comparative findings with other earlier structures. Eventually, experimental findings with 210 W output power and 25 kHz switching frequency demonstrates that the proposed converter can be used successfully.

Spectrally matching pulse-like records to a target RotD100 spectrum	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						ASCE7; instantaneous power; near-fault records; nonlinear response history analysis; pulse period; seismic input	NEAR-FAULT DIRECTIVITY; GROUND MOTIONS; ALGORITHM	This article evaluates two different approaches to generate pulse-like spectrally matched earthquake records pairs compatible with a target RotD100 spectrum. One is the conventional approach of separately matching each horizontal component to the target RotD100 spectrum, the other approach simultaneously modifies both horizontal components to tightly match the target RotD100. The characteristics of the resulting records are evaluated using amplitude scaled pulse records as baseline for comparison. It is shown that, using a target spectrum that includes a narrow-band modification to accommodate the presence of a pulse, largely increases both methodologies likelihood of generating spectrally matched records that preserve the pulse-like nature of the seeds. However, the records generated through independent component matching exhibit RotD100 spectral amplitudes that largely surpass the target amplitudes, and instantaneous power (IP) and peak ground velocities (PGV) substantially larger than the observed for the amplitude scaled records. Consequently, these motions generated unrealistically large inelastic demands when used as input for nonlinear response history analyses (NRHA), with mean peak inelastic demands up to 60% larger than the expected from amplitude scaled records. Conversely, the approach based on simultaneous modification of the two horizontal components generated the largest number of successful matches and the resulting records exhibited IP and PGV values close to the obtained for the amplitude scaled records. When used as input for NRHA, the mean peak inelastic demands were very close to the demands imposed by the amplitude scaled set. These results suggest that current 10% spectral amplitude penalization for spectrally matched records in ASCE7 is unnecessary for pulse-like motions.

Double trouble: Synchronous and metachronous primaries confound ctHPVDNA monitoring	HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK			English	Article; Early Access						cell-free DNA; circulating tumor DNA; human papillomavirus (HPV); oropharyngeal; sinonasal; squamous cell carcinoma		Background: Human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV + HNSCC) occurs in the oropharynx (HPV + OPSCC), sinonasal cavity (HPV + SNSCC), and nasopharynx (HPV + NPC). Circulating tumor HPV DNA (ctHPVDNA) is an accurate tool for diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and recurrence detection. An emerging challenge with ctHPVDNA is that similar to 7.4% of HPV + HNSCC patients develop synchronous or metachronous HPV+ primaries, which could confound ctHPVDNA monitoring. Methods: We describe a 65-year-old patient with T2N1M0 HPV16 + OPSCC and a 55-year-old patient with T2N2M0 HPV16 + OPSCC. Both patients were enrolled in our prospective observational ctHPVDNA study with longitudinal blood collections throughout treatment. Both patients developed multiple HPV+ primaries. Results: Detailed discussion of the patients' treatment courses, the subsequent diagnoses of their second HPV+ primaries, and their ctHPVDNA monitoring is presented. Conclusions: As ctHPVDNA use becomes more prevalent, it is important to recognize that an increase in ctHPVDNA can come not only from the primary tumor or metastatic clones, but also from synchronous or metachronous second primaries.

To address this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model comprising a drift-compensation module and classification module. Utilizing the nonlinear relationship between sensor readings and environmental covariates, the drift-compensation module corrects the drifted sensor readings in batch experiments by minimizing a scatteredness-based fitness function. The corrected values are then fed into the classification module. To train the proposed model, which involves optimizing two different objectives simultaneously, the hypernetwork-based optimization approach with the stochastic gradient descent is employed. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for mixed gas classification using synthetic and real gas mixture data collected from the UCI machine learning repository.

We reviewed the literature to answer the question: "Do EETTA and ExpTTA achieve high rates of complete resection and low rates of complications in treating patients with IAC pathologies?" Data SourcesPubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched. Review MethodsStudies reporting EETTA/ExpTTA for IAC pathologies were included. Indications and techniques were discussed and meta-analyzed rates of outcomes and complications were obtained with random-effect model meta-analyses. ResultsWe included 16 studies comprising 173 patients, all with non-serviceable hearing. Baseline FN function was mostly House-Brackmann-I (96.5%; 95% CI: 94.9-98.1%). Most lesions were vestibular/cochlear schwannomas (98.3%; 95% CI: 96.7-99.8%) of Koos-I (45.9%; 95% CI: 41.3-50.3%) or II (47.1%; 95% CI: 43-51.1%). EETTA was performed in 101 patients (58.4%; 95% CI: 52.4-64.3%) and ExpTTA in 72 (41.6%; 95% CI: 35.6-47.6%), achieving gross-total resection in all cases. Transient complications occurred in 30 patients (17.3%; 95% CI: 13.9-20.5%), with meta-analyzed rates of 9% (95% CI: 4-15%), comprising FN palsy with spontaneous resolution (10.4%; 95% CI: 7.7-13.1%). Persistent complications occurred in 34 patients (19.6%; 95% CI: 17.1-22.2%), with meta-analyzed rates of 12% (95% CI: 7-19%), comprising persistent FN palsy in 22 patients (12.7%; 95% CI: 10.2-15.2%). Mean follow-up was 16 months (range, 1-69; 95% CI: 14.7-17.4). Post-surgery FN function was stable in 131 patients (75.8%; 95% CI: 72.1-79.5%), worsened in 38 (21.9%; 95% CI: 18.8-25%), and improved in 4 (2.3%; 95% CI: 0.7-3.9%), with meta-analyzed rates of improved/stable response of 84% (95% CI: 76-90%). ConclusionTranspromontorial approaches offer newer routes for IAC surgery, but their restricted indications and unfavorable FN outcomes currently limit their use.

This review takes one of those areas, liquid crystals, and considers examples of motifs that have been deployed successfully to generate new mesogens. In particular, rather than attempting to be comprehensive, the article reviews critically data from well-characterised systems and seeks to first make some comparisons with analogous hydrogen-bonded materials, before considering how the lability and flexibility of the halogen bond expresses itself in liquid crystal behaviour.

Radical fluoroalkoxylation has recently emerged as a promising approach for synthesizing fluoroalkyl ethers. Herein, a solid, easy-to-access redox-active N-O reagent, 1-(fluoromethoxy)-3-methyl-benzotriazolium triflate (FMBT), serving as a radical source of (mono)fluoromethoxy group under photocatalytic conditions, was introduced. The synthetic potential of FMBT was demonstrated in the functionalization of olefins to access amino and ketomonofluoromethyl ethers, benefiting the related study in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery.

Squalene encapsulation by emulsification and freeze-drying process: Effects on bread fortification	JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE			English	Article						bread; egg white protein nanoparticles; emulsion; encapsulation; freeze-drying; squalene	EGG-WHITE; EMULSIFYING PROPERTIES; OXIDATIVE STABILITY; FUNCTIONAL BREAD; PEA PROTEIN; GREEN TEA; MICROENCAPSULATION; EXTRACTION; VITAMINS; SIZE	In the present work, squalene (SQ) was encapsulated by a conventional emulsion method using egg white protein nanoparticles (EWPn) as a high molecular weight surfactant, followed by a freeze-drying process to obtain an SQ powder ingredient. EWPn was produced by heat treatment at 85 degrees C, 10 min, and pH 10.5. EWPn showed higher emulsifying activity regarding native egg white protein (EWP), highlighting their potential to be used for the SQ encapsulation by an emulsification process. First, we explored the encapsulation conditions using pure corn oil as an SQ carrier. Conditions were oil fraction (0.1-0.2), protein amount (2-5 wt.%), homogenization pressure (100 and 200 bar), and maltodextrin amount (10-20 wt.%). At 0.15 oil fraction, 5 wt.%. protein concentration, 200 bar homogenization pressure, and 20% maltodextrin, the highest encapsulation efficiency (EE) was reached. Then, according to these conditions, SQ was encapsulated to obtain a freeze-dried powder ingredient for bread formulation. The total and free oil of SQ freeze-dried powder were 24.4% +/- 0.6% and 2.6% +/- 0.1%, respectively, resulting in an EE value of 89.5% +/- 0.5%. The physical, textural, and sensory properties of functional bread were not affected by the addition of 5.0% SQ freeze-dried powder. Finally, the bread loaves showed higher SQ stability than the one formulated with unencapsulated SQ. Hence, the encapsulation system developed was suitable for obtaining functional bread based on SQ fortification.

Materials and MethodsWe enrolled 53 patients with SPIDDM who were positive for GADA at the diagnosis and 98 non-diabetic individuals, and investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the 3 Screen ICA (cutoff index >= 30 units) compared with that of GADA. In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics of patients with SPIDDM who were negative or positive on 3 Screen ICA. ResultsThe positivity rates of 3 Screen ICA, GADA, IA-2A, and ZnT8A were 88.7, 86.8, 24.5, and 13.2%, respectively. The respective sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for SPIDDM were 88.7, 100, 100, and 94.2% by 3 Screen ICA and 86.8, 100, 100.0, and 93.3% by GADA. There were no significant differences in age at onset, duration of diabetes, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin and C-peptide levels, and the prevalence of autoimmune thyroiditis between patients with SPIDDM who were positive or negative on 3 Screen ICA. However, the prevalence of insulin users was significantly higher in those who were positive than in those who were negative on 3 Screen ICA. ConclusionsSimilar to GADA, 3 Screen ICA may be a useful diagnostic tool for detecting patients with SPIDDM.

However, achieving the long-term stability of copper pastes remains challenging due to their susceptibility to oxidation. Therefore, stable copper nanoparticles with a Cu(0)-Cu(I) core-shell structure containing a surface passivation layer of formate ions-involved Cu(I) coordination polymers are developed. Based on the self-reducing nature of the passivation layer, the nanoparticle-based copper pastes can be sintered in <1 min, showing high electrical conductivity (220 000 S cm(-1)), mechanical flexibility, and long-term stability after sintering. The excellent properties of the developed copper pastes are even comparable with the ones of silver pastes. These stable copper pastes have broad applications in printed electronics (e.g., glucose sensors, RFID tags, and electromagnetic shielding films), showing great potential in the fabrication of flexible printed electronics.

However, fundamental understanding of the solid-state conversion remains to be achieved. Here, taking potassium-sulfur batteries as a model system, we for the first time report the reducing overpotential of solid-state sulfide conversion via the meta-stable S-3(2-) intermediates on transition metal single-atom sulfur hosts. The catalytic sulfur host containing Cu single atoms demonstrates high capacities of 1595 and 1226 mAh g(-1) at current densities of 335 and 1675 mA g(-1), respectively, with stable Coulombic efficiency of approximate to 100 %. Combined spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical computations reveal that the relatively weak Cu-S bonding results in low overpotential of solid-state sulfide conversion and high sulfur utilization. The elucidation of solid-state sulfide conversion mechanism can direct the exploration of highly efficient metal-sulfur batteries.

Need for objective task-based evaluation of deep learning-based denoising methods: A study in the context of myocardial perfusion SPECT	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						deep learning; model observer; SPECT; task-based evaluation	GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK; LOW-DOSE CT; IMAGE QUALITY; COMPENSATION METHODS; PHANTOM POPULATION; LESION DETECTION; OBSERVER; OPTIMIZATION; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE	BackgroundArtificial intelligence-based methods have generated substantial interest in nuclear medicine. An area of significant interest has been the use of deep-learning (DL)-based approaches for denoising images acquired with lower doses, shorter acquisition times, or both. Objective evaluation of these approaches is essential for clinical application. PurposeDL-based approaches for denoising nuclear-medicine images have typically been evaluated using fidelity-based figures of merit (FoMs) such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM). However, these images are acquired for clinical tasks and thus should be evaluated based on their performance in these tasks. Our objectives were to: (1) investigate whether evaluation with these FoMs is consistent with objective clinical-task-based evaluation; (2) provide a theoretical analysis for determining the impact of denoising on signal-detection tasks; and (3) demonstrate the utility of virtual imaging trials (VITs) to evaluate DL-based methods. MethodsA VIT to evaluate a DL-based method for denoising myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) images was conducted. To conduct this evaluation study, we followed the recently published best practices for the evaluation of AI algorithms for nuclear medicine (the RELAINCE guidelines). An anthropomorphic patient population modeling clinically relevant variability was simulated. Projection data for this patient population at normal and low-dose count levels (20%, 15%, 10%, 5%) were generated using well-validated Monte Carlo-based simulations. The images were reconstructed using a 3-D ordered-subsets expectation maximization-based approach. Next, the low-dose images were denoised using a commonly used convolutional neural network-based approach. The impact of DL-based denoising was evaluated using both fidelity-based FoMs and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which quantified performance on the clinical task of detecting perfusion defects in MPS images as obtained using a model observer with anthropomorphic channels. We then provide a mathematical treatment to probe the impact of post-processing operations on signal-detection tasks and use this treatment to analyze the findings of this study. ResultsBased on fidelity-based FoMs, denoising using the considered DL-based method led to significantly superior performance. However, based on ROC analysis, denoising did not improve, and in fact, often degraded detection-task performance. This discordance between fidelity-based FoMs and task-based evaluation was observed at all the low-dose levels and for different cardiac-defect types. Our theoretical analysis revealed that the major reason for this degraded performance was that the denoising method reduced the difference in the means of the reconstructed images and of the channel operator-extracted feature vectors between the defect-absent and defect-present cases. ConclusionsThe results show the discrepancy between the evaluation of DL-based methods with fidelity-based metrics versus the evaluation on clinical tasks. This motivates the need for objective task-based evaluation of DL-based denoising approaches. Further, this study shows how VITs provide a mechanism to conduct such evaluations computationally, in a time and resource-efficient setting, and avoid risks such as radiation dose to the patient. Finally, our theoretical treatment reveals insights into the reasons for the limited performance of the denoising approach and may be used to probe the effect of other post-processing operations on signal-detection tasks.

However, conventional liquid ether electrolytes are not suitable for the high-voltage LMBs over 4.5 V due to their narrow potential windows. Herein, a gel electrolyte strategy is demonstrated to improve the high voltage stability of ether electrolytes in LMBs with Li-rich layered oxide (LLO) cathodes that usually operate at 4.6 V and above. Compared with a liquid electrolyte, the electrochemical window of the gel electrolyte with cross-linked amide framework is increased by 1 V. The strong cross-linked framework not only regulates the uniform growth of cathode electrolyte interface (CEI)/SEI on the cathode/anode sides, but also greatly increases the Li+ transference number and inhibits the generation of harmful substances by anchoring PF6- anions, thus providing a long cycle for LMBs at a high voltage up to 4.7 V. Simultaneously, the flame retardancy and flexibility of the gel electrolyte ensures the safe operation of high-voltage LMBs. Therefore, the LLO||Li pouch cell using gel electrolyte realizes stable cycling at a high voltage 4.6 V, and can pass the acupuncture test.

However, the inability to measure both cellular force and viscoelasticity of statistically significant number of cells noninvasively remains a challenge for quantitative characterizations of various cellular functions and practical applications. Here a double resonator piezoelectric cytometry (DRPC), using AT and BT cut quartz crystals of the same frequency and surface morphology is developed to simultaneously quantify the cells-generated forces (Delta S) and viscoelastic moduli (G ', G '') of a population of isolated single cells or cells with different degrees of cell-cell interactions in a non-invasive and real time manner. DRPC captures the dynamic mechanical parameters Delta S and G ', G '' during the adhesions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under different ligand densities of adhesion molecules fibronectin or Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) modified on the gold surfaces of 9 MHz AT and BT cut quartz crystals, and different seeding densities of HUVECs. It is found that both the ligand density and cell seeding density affect the magnitudes of Delta S and G ', G '' and their correlations are revealed for the first time by DRPC. The validity of DRPC is further verified by mechanical changes of the cells in response to treatments with cytoskeleton regulators.

Knowledge integration in family firms: Understanding the nexus between familiness and organizational effectiveness	EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access						dynamic capabilities; familiness; family business; knowledge integration; organizational effectiveness	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION; DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES; BUSINESS RESEARCH; MODERATING ROLE; CONSTRUCTION; PERSPECTIVE; PERFORMANCE; COMMITMENT; RESOURCE	Although knowledge integration has been deemed relevant for the development and survival of family firms, prior studies suggest that the lack of skills to combine and transfer incumbent family members' knowledge within the family may hinder family firms' organizational effectiveness. Knowledge integration, in this context, might depend on family involvement in ownership, management and governance, and family essence, considering the emotional and relational aspects of the influence the family exerts on the business. Relying on knowledge-based view and dynamic capability perspectives, we propose a model suggesting that knowledge integration intervenes in the relationship between familiness and organizational effectiveness. Our hypotheses are tested on a sample of 102 private Spanish family businesses. The results reveal that familiness is beneficial for knowledge integration, enhancing family firms' organizational effectiveness. Our study provides practical implications for family business owners and managers, and opportunities for further research.

J	Daly, S				Daly, Stephen			<i>Fiat</i> v<i> Commission:</i> A Misconception at the Heart of the Tax Ruling Cases	MODERN LAW REVIEW			English	Article; Early Access								In October 2015, a ripple was sent through the tax world when the European Commission found that Luxembourg and the Netherlands had provided unlawful State aid to Fiat and Starbucks. At the core of the Commission's decisions was the assertion that the Member States had misapplied the 'arm's length principle' - a principle which broadly seeks to ensure that transactions between associated enterprises are priced as if carried out by independent parties Both were appealed. The first decisions of the General Court were handed down in October 2019 and were a mixed bag for the Commission - a win in the Fiat decision, but not Starbucks. The judgment in the subsequent Fiat appeal was handed down in November 2022. This was the first opportunity the Court of Justice had to consider the Commission's central argument that Member States were bound to apply a general 'arm's length principle'. This case note analyses the judgment and considers its ramifications for other Member States, for multinationals, and for the capacity of EU law to tackle harmful tax competition.

But this is simply not true. Planning and response to disruptive events needs to consider the individual needs and vulnerabilities of the people involved which can be exacerbated due to gender, race, ethnicity, age, social class and disability. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the stark reality of vulnerability and disproportionality into focus, in planning for and responding to major incidents and emergencies. In recognition of this, London's NHS emergency preparedness, resilience and response (EPRR) community decided to investigate our own diversity to understand whether we represent Londoners and to use our findings to inform future NHS preparedness for major incidents and emergencies. This paper describes the first part: understanding our own diversity. Armed with this knowledge, we will now strive to be more inclusive of all Londoners in our planning.

Techno-economic and policy analysis of hydrogen and gasoline production from forest biomass, agricultural residues and municipal solid waste in California	BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR			English	Article						Biomass and biofuels; Hydrogen; Climate and Energy Policy; California Low Carbon Fuels Standard; Bioenergy	COST; GASIFICATION; FUELS	Techno-economic and policy analyses were performed of hydrogen and gasoline production from forest biomass (FB). They were compared with fuels produced using agricultural residues and municipal solid waste in California. Twelve process designs were analyzed, with and without carbon capture and storage, and life-cycle analysis was performed, using California's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) 3.0 model, to calculate the average life-cycle carbon intensity of different process designs for hydrogen and gasoline. Discounted cash flow models were developed to assess profitability in terms of the net present value and internal rate of return (IRR). The results showed that forest-to-fuel pathways (positive IRR between 2%-16%) were the least competitive biomass-based pathway option. Sensitivity analysis was performed on economic parameters including feedstock price and renewable identification number (RIN) credit price. In the case of RIN credits, profitability declined significantly as the proportion of FB from federal lands increased given existing statutory limitations. Given the importance of increasing forest management to reduce wildfire risks, the necessary additional policy incentives were quantified to equalize the cost of forest-to-fuels pathways with the other biofuels pathways. To ensure FB-to-fuels pathways are cost competitive with agricultural residues, policymakers could increase the low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credit price for forest fuels (additional credit price support of $41-75 t/CO(2)e), give additional credit to lifecycle emissions reductions from forest fuels (additional carbon intensity decrease of 19-76 gCO2e MJ(-1)), provide concessionary debt or equity with a target weighted average cost of capital (WACC) = 3-4%, subsidize capital costs (12-22% of costs), or subsidize FB delivery ($35-66 per dry ton delivered).

Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic splines were used to investigate the associations between GGap and mortality.Results: During a median follow-up of 16.8 years, 3528 deaths occurred, including 1140 CV deaths. The associations of GGap with risk of all-cause and CV mortality were U-shaped (both P for non-linearity < .001). Compared with individuals with a GGap of 0.09%-0.38% (61st-80th centiles), the multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for individuals with a GGap less than -0.83% (first-fifth centiles) and individuals with a GGap greater than 0.90% (96th-100th centiles) were 1.36 (1.10, 1.69) and 1.21 (1.00, 1.45) for all-cause mortality, and 1.77 (1.16, 2.71) and 1.43 (1.04, 1.95) for CV mortality. The GGap value associated with the lowest risk of all-cause and CV mortality was 0.38% in the general population and 0.78% among individuals with diabetes.Conclusions: We found a U-shaped association between GGap and all-cause and CV mortality, with significant positive or negative GGap values associated with increased mortality risk, probably because of glycaemic variability and fructosamine-3-kinase activity.

Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in large river secondary channels: Contemporaneous and legacy effects of flow connectivity	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Connectivity; Large River; Lower Mississippi River; Macroinvertebrates	FLOODPLAIN SYSTEM; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DYNAMICS; FISH; HABITATS; DANUBE	In large rivers, secondary channels occur where the main channel is divided by an instream island, forming one or multiple smaller channels outside the main channel. Secondary channels are highly variable in morphometry, flow characteristics, and degree of connectivity to the main channel. Engineered closing structures at the upstream end of most secondary channels restrict inflow from the main channel, resulting in gradients of flow connectivity among secondary channels that vary with river stage. We investigated the relationship of flow connectivity to benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage richness and structure among a series of secondary channels of the Lower Mississippi River. Samples were collected over 2 years at times of high and low river stages. We discovered (1) macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and taxonomic richness varied along the flow connectivity gradient, and (2) there was a legacy effect of prior connection on assemblage structure that lasted up to a year. We contend that for management and restoration planning aimed at conservation of large river biological diversity, an important consideration are the life history requirements of animals utilizing secondary channel habitats.

However, preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts with the above three advantages remains conceptually challenging. This work reports the preparation of N-doped carbon confined NiCo alloy hollow spheres (NiCo@N-C HS) as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn-air battery with a higher energy density (788.7 mWh g(Zn)(-1)) and outstanding cycling stability (over 200 h), which are more durable than the commercialized Pt/C+RuO2-based device. Electrochemical results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the synergy in the NiCo@N-C accelerates the electronic transmission for improving activation of O-2* and OH* intermediates and optimizing reacted free energy pathways, while the hollow structures exposure more active sites for improving the reaction kinetics and enhancing the activity of ORR/OER reaction. This work provides crucial understanding for constructing low-cost transition metal-based catalyst to overcome the efficiency and durability barriers of metal-air batteries for widespread applications.

J	Hultman, M; Cooper, S				Hultman, Maja; Cooper, Sophie			Revisiting space and emotion: New ways to study buildings and feelings	HISTORY COMPASS			English	Article							HISTORY; ANXIETY	In her 2014 History Compass article, Margrit Pernau issued a call for scholars to consider entanglements between history of emotion methodologies and space. She argued that 'bodies are necessarily situated in space, and they bear the imprint of the spaces they are moving through and have moved through.' Nine years after the publication of Pernau's article, this study engages with developments in the field of history of emotions to posit that emotional methodologies provide important opportunities for scholars of the urban built environment, adding additional lenses that can help to push the boundaries of urban history. Extending Pernau's thesis by borrowing theoretical and methodological muscle from affect theory and the combined field of slavery and gender studies, via the concepts of atmospheres, reconstruction, and critical fabulation, this article explores new avenues for research that aims to understand and analyse marginalised groups in urban history. The explorative analysis is tested on a macroanalysis of social processes among the Irish diaspora in nineteenth century Melbourne and Chicago and a microhistorical study of a Pietist orphanage in nineteenth century Stockholm and thus showcases the possibility of the approach to go beyond spatial-emotional management and reach contradictory and alternative strategies and experiences.

A multi-stock, multi-fleet, bioeconomic model was used to understand management options under these combined influences. Scenarios considered climate change effects on recruitment of three main gadoid stocks (cod - Gadus morhua, saithe - Pollachius virens, whiting - Merlangius merlangus), possible future developments of fuel and fish prices, and strict implementation of a landing obligation. The latter leads to decreased yield and profits in the short term due to increased choke effects, mainly of North Sea cod, being influenced by climate-induced productivity changes. Allowing fishing above F-MSY, but within sustainable limits, or limiting year-to-year quota changes, could help buffer initial losses at the expense of decreased profits in the mid- to long-term. Economic performance of individual fleets was linked to their main target's stock status, cost structure, and fuel and fish prices. The results highlight a need to consider both biological and economic consequences of climate change in the management of mixed fisheries.

We previously established an acquired 5-FU-resistant CRC cell line, HCT116R(F10), and examined its biological features and 5-FU resistance mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the 5-FU sensitivity and cellular respiration dependency of HCT116R(F10) cells and parental HCT116 cells under conditions of high- and low-glucose concentrations. Both HCT116R(F10) and parental HCT116 cells were more sensitive to 5-FU under low-glucose conditions compared with high-glucose conditions. Interestingly, HCT116R(F10) and parental HCT116 cells exhibited altered cellular respiration dependence for glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration under high- and low-glucose conditions. Additionally, HCT116R(F10) cells showed a markedly decreased ATP production rate compared with HCT116 cells under both high- and low-glucose conditions. Importantly, glucose restriction significantly reduced the ATP production rate for both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in HCT116R(F10) cells compared with HCT116 cells. The ATP production rates in HCT116R(F10) and HCT116 cells were reduced by approximately 64% and 23%, respectively, under glucose restriction, suggesting that glucose restriction may be effective at enhancing 5-FU chemotherapy. Overall, these findings shed light on 5-FU resistance mechanisms, which may lead to improvements in anticancer treatment strategies.

Dynamics of Electronically Excited Metal Atoms (Zn and Cd) in Rare Gas Matrices: Simulation of Multiple-band Emission using Molecular Dynamics with Quantum Transitions	CHEMPHYSCHEM			English	Article						molecular dynamics; exciplex formation; matrix isolation; excitation spectra; relaxation path	LUMINESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY; NONADIABATIC DYNAMICS; PAIR-POTENTIALS; STATE; ZINC; AR	Molecular dynamics with quantum transitions approach is employed to simulate the spectroscopic characteristics of the P-1(1)<-> S-1(0) transitions in atomic zinc and cadmium in order to gain insight into the excited state behavior of these atoms isolated in solid rare gases neon, argon, and krypton. The absorption and emission spectra are simulated. Non-radiative processes play a fundamental role in the transfer of population among the three electronic states initially accessed in absorption. Three distinct relaxation pathways were identified. Two of these are related to the dynamical modes described in previous works [McCaffrey and Kerins, J. Chem.

Comparative analysis of reciprocating and flat-side heat-treated rotary single-file systems: Design, metallurgical characteristics, and mechanical performance	INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL			English	Article						cyclic fatigue; endodontics; reciprocation; root canal treatment; single-file rotary system; torsional strength	CYCLIC FATIGUE RESISTANCE; INSTRUMENTS; KINEMATICS	AimTo compare two flat-side single-file rotary instruments with three single-file reciprocating systems through a multimethod assessment. MethodologyA total of 290 new NiTi single-file rotary (AF F One Blue 25/0.06 and Platinum V.EU 25/0.06) and reciprocating (One Files Blue R25, Reciproc Blue R25, Reciproc R25) instruments were selected, carefully examined for any major deformations, and evaluated regarding their macroscopic and microscopic design, nickel and titanium elements ratio, phase transformation temperatures, and mechanical performance (time/rotation to fracture, maximum torque, angle of rotation, microhardness, maximum bending, and buckling strengths). One-way anova post hoc Tukey, T-test, and nonparametric Mood's median tests were used for statistical comparisons (alpha = 5%). ResultsTested instruments had identical blade counts and near-identical helical angles of approximately 24 degrees (rotary instruments) and 151 degrees (reciprocating instruments). The flat-side analysis revealed a few inconsistencies, such as discontinuity segments, different orientations, and gaps in the homogeneity of the bluish colour. Microscopically, flat-side instruments exhibited blade discontinuity and an incomplete S-shaped cross-section. The surface finish was smoother for One Files Blue and more irregular for both rotary instruments. There were distinct phase transformation temperatures amongst all instruments. All heat-treated instruments were in R-phase arrangement, and Reciproc was in R-phase plus austenite at test temperature (20 degrees C). Compared with the reciprocating instruments, both flat-side instruments exhibited lower results in the cyclic fatigue tests using two different clockwise kinematics, maximum torque, angle of rotation, and maximum buckling strength (p < .05). The rotary systems also exhibited low flexibility (p < .05). AF F One Blue had the lowest microhardness, whilst Reciproc had the highest value. ConclusionThis multimethod investigation revealed that the flat-side rotary instruments underperformed the reciprocating instruments regarding cyclic fatigue (with two different clockwise kinematics), maximum torque, angle of rotation, maximum buckling strength, and flexibility. Manufacturing inconsistencies were also observed in some of the flat-side instruments, including discontinuity segments, different orientations, and in the homogeneity of their bluish colour given by the heat treatment.

Nevertheless, the presence of hysteresis controllers and inaccurate voltage switching table in traditional DTC results in higher torque and flux ripple. This study proposes an enhanced DTC functioned Surface-mounted PMSM (S-PMSM) drive with mitigation of torque and flux ripple. The operation relies on generating the reference voltage vector (VV) in a stationary reference frame, which supports control of torque and flux without hysteresis controllers. The reference VV generation is simple and does not affect control robustness. The position of reference VV in a sector is used to build the voltage vector (VV) switching table. As a result, the application of nearest discrete VV to reference VV produces optimal torque and flux control. Moreover, redundant switching combinations of null VV are effectively used for possible minimization of switching frequency of two-level voltage source inverter (VSI) supplied S-PMSM drive. Therefore, proposed DTC gains improved S-PMSM drive response along with switching frequency reduction. In dSPACE-RTI 1104 platform, experimental response of S-PMSM drive under various operating conditions have been depicted to highlight the proficiency of proposed DTC in comparison with existing DTC.

In this study, the effects of sub-sterilizing doses of gamma radiation (100-250 Gy for CLM, 90-180 Gy for ECB) on the biological and reproductive parameters of F1 progeny from irradiated males were determined. The results indicated that males irradiated at doses of = 200 and = 150 Gy produced highly sterile F1 descents for CLM and ECB, respectively. No adverse effects of radiation doses applied to males were observed on the F1 pupal emergence for both species, nor on the adult longevity of male and female ECB moths. However, the life span of CLM F1 male and female adults decreased with increasing doses. The sex ratio of emerged adults of F1 progeny from irradiated males was skewed towards males with increasing doses; the proportion of males to all emerged adults reached 0.52 and 0.54 at doses of 250 and 150 Gy for CLM and ECB, compared to 0.44 and 0.49 in the controls, respectively. The competitiveness index of irradiated and F1 males of both species fluctuated in acceptable ranges and in general F1 males were stronger competitors than their irradiated male parents. The results of the field cage experiments showed that the larval infestation in all cages including the released irradiated CLM and ECB moths decreased compared to the control treatment - the percentage of damaged leaves and stems in the cages with ratios of 20:1 and 7:1 irradiated-to-normal insects (highest ratios assayed) reached half and one-third of the control for CLM and ECB, respectively.

However, an ever alert and robust immune system is essential for maintaining good health, but resource investment into immunity needs to be traded off against allocation to other functions. In this study, we study the consequences of such a trade-off with growth by ascertaining various components of baseline innate immunity in two types of Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for fast development, in combination with either a long effective lifespan (FLJs) or a short effective lifespan (FEJs). We found that distinct immunological parameters were constitutively elevated in both, FLJs and FEJs compared to their ancestral control (JB) populations, and these constitutive elevated immunological parameters were associated with reduced insulin signalling and comparable total gut microbiota. Our results bring into focus the inter-relationship between egg to adult development time, ecdysone levels, larval gut microbiota, insulin signalling, adult reproductive longevity and immune function. We discuss how changes in selection pressures operating on life-history traits can modulate different components of immune system.

MethodsUsing Danish, nationwide registries (1980-2016), we identified patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (N = 295,653) and patients with a diagnosis of obesity (N = 312,108). Patients were matched (1:3) to persons from the general population on birth year and sex. We computed incidence rates and Cox regression derived hazard ratios (HRs) of a diagnosis of ALS. In multivariable analyses, HRs were controlled for sex, birth year, calendar year, and comorbidities. ResultsWe observed 168 incident cases of ALS (0.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6-0.8] per 10,000 person-years) among patients with type 2 diabetes and 859 incident cases of ALS (0.9 [95% CI: 0.9-1.0] per 10,000 person-years) among matched comparators. The adjusted HR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.72-1.04). The association was present among men (adjusted HR: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.62-0.99]) but not women (adjusted HR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.78-1.37]), and among those aged >= 60 years (adjusted HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.59-0.96]) but not younger. We observed 111 ALS events (0.4 [95% CI: 0.4-0.5] per 10,000 person-years) among obesity patients and 431 ALS events (0.5 [95% CI: 0.5-0.6] per 10,000 person-years) among comparators. The adjusted HR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70-1.11). ConclusionsDiagnoses of type 2 diabetes and obesity were associated with a reduced rate of ALS compared with general population comparators, particularly among men and patients aged 60 years or above. However, absolute rate differences were small.

One effective approach to addressing this issue is sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of porous crystalline material that have emerged as promising sorbents for water harvesting due to their high surface area, tunable pore size, and customizable pore chemistry. In this mini-review, we provide an overview of the different types of COFs, their structural characteristics, and the diverse linkage chemistries used to construct them. Then, we summarize recent advances in using COF-based sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, including strategies for controlling sorption properties and optimizing performance in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges associated with improving the efficiency of COF-based SAWH systems.

Herein, we have designed and synthesized a novel pyrazine-based 2D c-MOF (TPQG-Cu-MOF) bearing extended p-conjugated structure and abundant redox active sites. Thanks to the excellent redox reversibility of pyrazine units and CuO2 units, as well as the insolubility of the rigid framework skeleton, TPQG-Cu-MOF as the cathode material of lithium-ion battery exhibits a reversible specific capacity (150.2 mAh center dot g(-1) at 20 mAh center dot g(-1)), good cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.6% after 500 cycles at 1 A center dot g(-1)) and excellent rate performance. Comprehensive ex-situ spectroscopic studies revealed the reversible redox activity of pyrazine units and CuO2 units of TPQG-Cu-MOF during the Li+ insertion/extraction process. The deepening fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship was proposed, which might pave the way for further development of efficient MOF-based energy storage devices.

J	Thumbeck, SM; Webster, J; Domahs, F				Thumbeck, Sarah-Maria; Webster, Janet; Domahs, Frank			Comprehensive Assessment of Reading in Aphasia (CARA) reading questionnaire-German version	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS			English	Article						alexia; aphasia; comprehension; personal perception; reading; translation	CULTURAL-ADAPTATION; TRANSLATION; GUIDELINES; OUTCOMES	BackgroundReading comprehension is frequently impaired in persons with aphasia (PWA). For goal-setting and outcome measurement, speech and language therapists (SLTs) need to determine an individual's perspective of their reading difficulties and everyday reading activities. The Comprehensive Assessment of Reading in Aphasia (CARA) reading questionnaire provides a person-centred tool to find out the individual perception of reading functions, reading-related emotions and reading activities in PWA. It was developed and evaluated in English. So far, there is no equivalent instrument in German. AimsTo translate and adapt the CARA reading questionnaire into German language and culture, to evaluate its practicability and acceptance, and to provide the first psychometric properties of the German version. Methods & ProceduresBased on translation and adaptation guidelines, we conducted two forward translations that were merged and then adapted. A back translation was prepared and compared with the original version. It was found to be semantically equivalent by one of the authors of the original version. We performed pilot testing with 12 PWA, and the pilot version was adapted according to the comments of these participants. We then collected data on self-reported perception of reading and on psychometric properties of the translated and adapted German version. A total of 22 German-speaking PWA completed the questionnaire at least five times during an intervention study. We analysed retest reliability with Spearman correlation, internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha, internal responsiveness with the standardized response mean, as well as the relationship between outcomes of the questionnaire and text comprehension measures using repeated measures correlations. Outcomes & ResultsOur data suggest good practicability and acceptance of the German version of the CARA reading questionnaire as well as appropriate validity, reliability and sensitivity to measure therapy-induced change. We found moderate correlations between outcomes of the questionnaire and text-level reading speed. Conclusions & ImplicationsThe German version of the CARA reading questionnaire could be helpful in intervention planning and goal-setting with German-speaking PWA. By using the questionnaire, SLTs can find out about a person's individual perception of reading difficulties as well as individually relevant reading activities. The questionnaire provides a tool to measure change and is therefore valuable to demonstrate self-reported individual progress. As reading speed seems to be an indicator of personal perception of reading difficulty, it is important to consider reading speed in reading interventions and in reading comprehension assessments. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSWhat is already known on the subjectReading comprehension is frequently impaired in PWA. Reading preferences, the perception of difficulties and the impact on everyday life reading activities are specific to the individual and thus need to be known for goal-setting, intervention planning and monitoring of change. As part of a comprehensive assessment of reading, Morris et al. developed a person-centred English language questionnaire for this purpose. So far, there is no equivalent tool in German. What this paper adds to the existing knowledgeIn this study, we translated and adapted the questionnaire to German language and culture, and analysed its validity and reliability with German-speaking PWA. We demonstrated that the German version is accessible for German-speaking PWA, and that it has appropriate validity, reliability and sensitivity to measure self-reported change. Outcomes of the questionnaire correlate with text level reading speed. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?The German version of the questionnaire could be a valuable self-reported outcome measure to assess individual perceptions of reading and to measure progress (as perceived by an individual) as a consequence of recovery or intervention in either clinical or research settings. As reading speed might be an indicator of everyday life reading as perceived by an individual, it should be considered in reading assessments and interventions.

The aim of this study was to examine cerebellum volume in a healthy paediatric population. Materials and methodsTo provide MRI-based volumetric measurements of the cerebellum, images from the years 2019 to 2021 were scanned retrospectively. A total of 100 images, including the paediatric population aged 0-15 years, were imported into the volBrain software. Volumetric segmentations were obtained automatically, and each lobular cerebellar volume was obtained. The samples were divided into groups of 0-2 years (n = 18), 3-5 years (n = 24), 6-11 years (n = 34) and 12-15 years (n = 24). Obtained cerebellar volumes, age groups, gender and bilateral side comparisons were made. ResultsIn the comparative analyses performed for the total cerebellum and each of the 12 lobular segments, statistically significant differences were found between the age groups in all measurements except Crus II, lobules VIIB, VIIIA and VIIIB (p < 0.05). In multiple comparison tests, statistically significant differences were found between defined age groups, especially infants and toddlers and early adolescence groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between the ages of the subjects and their cerebellum volumes (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found in lobules I-II, VI, VIIIB, IX and X in right and left side volumes (p < 0.05). ConclusionThere is a tendency to increase in cerebellar volume during the transition from childhood to adolescence. The cerebellum has volumetric differences in the first years of life and during adolescence. When the development of a healthy cerebellum is analysed based on volumetric segmentation, differences are observed. The findings of this study may be useful in confirming various theories attributed to the cerebellum in the clinic.

In this study, dipicolinic acid (DPA), which is one of the main components of Bacillus spores, was evaluated as a new elicitor to enhance kiwifruit resistance to B. cinerea. RESULTSDPA enhances antioxidant capacity and induces the accumulation of phenolics in B. cinerea-infected 'Xuxiang' kiwifruit. The contents of the main antifungal phenolics in kiwifruit, including caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and isoferulic acid, increased after DPA treatment. DPA enhanced H2O2 levels after 0 and 1 days, which promoted catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, reducing long-term H2O2 levels. DPA promoted the up-regulation of several kiwifruit defense genes, including CERK1, MPK3, PR1-1, PR1-2, PR5-1 and PR5-2. Furthermore, DPA at 5 mM inhibited B. cinerea symptoms in kiwifruit (95.1% lesion length inhibition) more effectively than the commercial fungicides carbendazim, difenoconazole, prochloraz and thiram. CONCLUSIONSThe antioxidant properties of DPA and the main antifungal phenolics of kiwifruit were examined for the first time. This study uncovers new insights regarding the potential mechanisms used by Bacillus species to induce disease resistance. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C2H4 from the C-2 hydrocarbons typically entails high-energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are low-energy separation technologies that manufacture high-purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C2H4 from the C-2 hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C2H4 from the C-2 hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C2H4 from the C-2 hydrocarbons.

The FS3-C's successor, the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (FS7-C2), provides denser spatial data coverage over the Tropics and Subtropics, where severe weather systems often occur. This study investigates the impact of FS7-C2 refractivity profiles on the prediction of TC genesis. A quick observing system simulation experiment is conducted for the period when Hurricanes Helene and Gordon (2006) occurred over the North Atlantic Ocean using a regional ensemble data assimilation system. Though assimilating FS3-C or FS7-C2 ROs successfully reproduces Helene's development, assimilating FS7-C2 ROs better captures the genesis and development of Gordon with abundant moisture and vorticity in Gordon's core region, providing conditions favorable for the development of deep convection. A minimum area-mean total precipitable water vapor of 54 mm, as well as the existence of mid-level cyclonic vorticity (e.g., 500 hPa), at the storm core region in the initial condition is required for forecasting Gordon's genesis. Also, the assimilation of FS7-C2 ROs in our experiments reduces the 500 hPa geopotential error by 22% and improves probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecast compared with assimilating FS3-C ROs. Two sensitivity tests are conducted to evaluate the impact of low-level negatively biased FS7-C2 RO profiles and the removal of FS7-C2 data below 3 km on Gordon's genesis. The former test does not degrade Gordon's genesis forecast skills due to a dipole error correlation between the background ROs and the moisture field over an observed RO profile near Gordon. The latter test does degrade Gordon's forecast skills but is still better than the assimilation of FS3-C ROs since the features of low-level moisture and mid-level vorticity are preserved to some extent.

J	Awada, Z; Nedjar, B				Awada, Zeinab; Nedjar, Boumediene			On a finite strain modeling of growth in budding yeast	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						axisymmetric shells; finite element method; growth; large deformations; numerical discretization; walled cells	MULTIPLICATIVE DECOMPOSITIONS; TURGOR PRESSURE; CELL WALL; FORMULATION; ENDOCYTOSIS; FRAMEWORKS; ELEMENT; FORCES; SEPTUM	Cell's ability to proliferate constitutes one of the most defining features of life. The proliferation occurs through a succession of events; the cell cycle, whereby the cell grows and divides. In this paper, focus is made on the growth step and we deal specifically with Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast that reproduces by budding. For this, we develop a theoretical model to predict the growth powered by the turgor pressure. This cell is herein considered as a thin-walled structure with almost axisymmetrical shape. Due to its soft nature, the large deformation range is a priori assumed through a finite growth modeling framework. The used kinematics is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastically reversible part and a growth part. Constitutive equations are proposed where use is made of hyperelasticity together with a local evolution equation, this latter to describe the way growth takes place. In particular, two essential parameters are involved: a stress-like threshold, and a characteristic time. The developed model is extended to a shell approach as well. In a finite element context, representative numerical simulations examining stress-dependent growth are given and a parametric study is conducted to show the sensitivity with respect to the above mentioned parameters. Finally, a suggestion for natural contractile ring modeling closes this study.

In addition to their ultrahigh catalytic activities, their inherent and unique charge-carrier-releasing properties can be used to initiate various redox catalytic reactions, displaying bright prospects for future medical applications. Triggered by mechanical energy, piezocatalytic materials can release electrons/holes, catalyze redox reactions of substrates, or intervene in biological processes to promote the production of effector molecules for medical purposes, such as decontamination, sterilization, and therapy. Such a medical application of piezocatalysis is termed as piezocatalytic medicine (PCM) herein. To pioneer novel medical technologies, especially therapeutic modalities, this review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art research progress in piezocatalytic medicine. First, the principle of piezocatalysis and the preparation methodologies of piezoelectric materials are introduced.

Continued stabilization of blood collections and transfusions in the United States: Findings from the 2021 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey	TRANSFUSION			English	Article; Early Access						blood donation; blood transfusion; survey		Background: National Blood Collection and Utilization Surveys (NBCUS) have reported decreases in U.S. blood collections and transfusions since 2008. The declines began to stabilize in 2015-2017, with a subsequent increase in transfusions in 2019. Data from the 2021 NBCUS were analyzed to understand the current dynamics of blood collection and use in the United States. Methods: In March 2022, all community-based (53) and hospital-based (83) blood collection centers, a randomly selected 40% of transfusing hospitals performing 100-999 annual inpatient surgeries, and all transfusing hospitals performing >= 1000 annual inpatient surgeries were sent a 2021 NBCUS survey to ascertain blood collection and transfusion data. Responses were compiled, and national estimates were calculated for the number of units of blood and blood components collected, distributed, transfused, and outdated in 2021. Weighting and imputation were applied to account for non-responses and missing data, respectively. Results: Survey response rates were 92.5% (49/53) for community-based blood centers, 74.7% (62/83) for hospital-based blood centers, and 76.3% (2102/2754) for transfusing hospitals. Overall, 11,784,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 11,392,000-12,177,000) whole blood and apheresis red blood cell (RBC) units were collected in 2021, a 1.7% increase from 2019; 10,764,000 (95% CI, 10,357,000-11,171,000) whole blood-derived and apheresis RBC units were transfused, a 0.8% decrease. Total platelet units distributed increased by 0.8%; platelet units transfused decreased by 3.0%; plasma units distributed increased by 16.2%; and plasma units transfused increased by 1.4%. Discussion: The 2021 NBCUS findings demonstrate a stabilization in U.S. blood collections and transfusions, suggesting a plateau has been reached for both.	[Free, Rebecca J.; Sapiano, Mathew R.

The results indicated that post-IR (2 Gy) treatment of DSePA (5 mu M) led to a significantly higher cell death as compared to that of DSePA and IR treatments separately. Importantly, combinatorial treatment also showed reduction in the proportion of cancer stem cells and the clonogenic survival of A549 cells. The mechanistic studies indicated that combinatorial treatment although exhibited reductive environment (marked by decrease in ROS and increase of GSH/GSSG) at early time points (2-6 h postradiation), slowed DNA repair, inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/cell migration and induced significant level of apoptosis. DSePA mediated suppression of ATM/DNAPKs/p53 (DNA damage response signaling) and Akt/G-CSF (EMT) pathways appeared to be the major mechanism responsible for its radio-modulating activity. Finally, the combined treatment of IR (2 Gy x 4) and DSePA (0.1-0.25 mg/kg body weight daily through oral gavage) showed a significantly higher tumor suppression of the A549 xenograft as compared to that of DSePA and IR treatments separately in the mouse model. In conclusion, post-IR treatment of DSePA augmented cell kill by inhibiting DNA repair and cell migration in A549 cells.

However, the conventional Birch reduction reaction using liquid ammonia requires laborious procedures to ensure inert conditions and low temperatures. Although several ammonia-free modifications have been reported, the development of an operationally simple, efficient, and scalable protocol remains a challenge. Herein, we report an ammonia-free lithium-based Birch reduction in air without special operating conditions using a ball-milling technique. This method is characterized by its operational simplicity and an extremely short reaction time (within 1 min), probably owing to the in situ mechanical activation of lithium metal, broad substrate scope, and no requirement for dry bulk solvents. The potential of our flash Birch reaction is also demonstrated by the efficient reduction of bioactive target molecules and gram-scale synthesis.

So far, high ZT has been achieved using heavy elements to reduce lattice thermal conductivity (?(lat)). However, it is not preferred to use such elements because of their environmental load and high material cost. Here a new approach utilizing hydride anion (H-) substitution to oxide ion is proposed for ZT enhancement in thermoelectric oxide SrTiO3 bulk polycrystals. Light element H- substitution largely reduces ?(lat) from 8.2 W/(mK) of SrTiO3 to 3.5 W/(mK) for SrTiO3-xHx with x = 0.216. The mass difference effect on phonon scattering is small in the SrTiO3-xHx, while local structure distortion arising from the distributed Ti-(O,H) bond lengths strongly enhances phonon scattering. The polycrystalline SrTiO3-xHx shows high electronic conductivity comparable to La-doped SrTiO3 single crystal because the H- substitution does not form a grain boundary potential barrier and thus suppresses electron scattering. As a consequence, SrTiO3-xHx bulk exhibits maximum ZT = 0.11 at room temperature and the ZT value increases continuously up to 0.22 at T = 657 K. The H- substitution idea offers a new approach for ZT enhancement in thermoelectric materials without utilizing heavy elements.

Interviews were used to explore acceptability.Results Average compliance was 70.4%, while 26% of participants dropped out. Compliance was good in ambulatory (88.9%) and residential care (75.6%), but not in the juvenile detention setting (19.4%). The content of self-selected diary items varied widely. Participants deemed the method acceptable.Conclusions Daily monitoring is feasible for individuals with a mild intellectual disability or borderline intellectual functioning receiving ambulatory or residential care, and can provide scientists and practitioners with important insights into day-to-day behavioural patterns.

Herein, a special designed laser-processing pretreatment is conducted on the surface of 5052Al, and friction-lap joining (FLJ) is employed to join pretreated 5052Al to the CFRP with 50%-55% fiber content. The maximal tensile shear force and strength reach 4.06 kN and 18.04 MPa, respectively, with an increment of 72% compared to the untreated sample. It is the first time to achieve the high-strength joint of Al alloys to CFRPs with high contents of continuous fibers via FLJ. The joining area and adhesion work are quantified by theoretical calculations, and the residual stresses are visualized by finite-element analysis. The laser-processing pretreatment changes the plain Al alloy surface structure into the rough and porous structure, largely increasing the mechanical interlocking effect of the joint, and also changes the Al alloy surface wetting behavior and increases the adhesion work from 59.66 to 81.17 mN m(-1). That largely changes the chemical reaction feature between the CFRP and Al alloy, resulting in their tight bonding. In addition, the residual stresses weaken, which further improve the tight bonding effect.

PLLA nanofibers have good biocompatibility, but the weak piezoelectric coefficient limits the ability of the nanofibers to stimulate cell growth. Therefore, the PLLA piezoelectric film is combined with the PLLA nanofibers to make a multilayer film. In our tests, the piezoelectric output of the multilayer film approximate to 260 mV. In the biological experiments section, without piezoelectric stimulation, the cell length on the nanofibers is approximately twice that of the cells in the blank control group. The length of cells cultured on piezoelectric-based stimulated nanofibers is more than twice that of cells cultured on nanofibers without piezoelectric stimulation. Therefore, it is confirmed that under the dual action of nanofiber guidance and piezoelectric stimulation, the growth rate of cells is four times faster than that in ordinary Petri dishes. Intracellular calcium imaging experiments confirmed that the concentration of Ca2+ in electrically stimulated cells is approximately twice that of ordinary cells. It is also confirmed that piezoelectric materials can complete electrical stimulation of cells in indirect contact with cells.

Functional traits and trait coordination change over the life of a leaf in a tropical fern species	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						development; investment; leaf age; photosynthesis; physiology; resource allocation	PHOTOSYNTHETIC CAPACITY; ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; R PACKAGE; AGE; NITROGEN; GROWTH; REPRODUCTION; CARBON; METABOLICS; ALLOCATION	Premise: Plant ecological strategies are often defined by the integration of underlying traits related to resource acquisition, allocation, and growth. Correlations between key traits across diverse plants suggest that variation in plant ecological strategies is largely driven by a fast-slow continuum of plant economics. However, trait correlations may not be constant through the life of a leaf, and it is still poorly understood how trait function varies over time in long-lived leaves. Methods: Here, we compared trait correlations related to resource acquisition and allocation across three different mature frond age cohorts in a tropical fern species, Saccoloma inaequale. Results: Fronds exhibited high initial investments of nitrogen and carbon, but with declining return in photosynthetic capacity after the first year. In the youngest fronds, we found water-use efficiency to be significantly lower than in the oldest mature fronds due to increased transpiration rates. Our data suggest that middle-aged fronds are more efficient relative to younger, less water-use efficient fronds and that older fronds exhibit greater nitrogen investments without higher photosynthetic return. In addition, several trait correlations expected under the leaf economics spectrum (LES) do not hold within this species, and some trait correlations only appear in fronds of a specific developmental age. Conclusions: These findings contextualize the relationship between traits and leaf developmental age with those predicted to underlie plant ecological strategy and the LES and are among the first pieces of evidence for when relative physiological trait efficiency is maximized in a tropical fern species.

Advanced practice clinicians (APCs)-which include nurse practitioners and physician assistants-increasingly provide primary care to this population. To fill current gaps in the literature, we measured the association between APC involvement in end-of-life care versus hospice utilization and hospitalization for older adults with ADRD. METHODSUsing Medicare data, we identified nursing home- (N=517,490) and community-dwelling (N=322,461) beneficiaries with ADRD who died between 2016 and 2018. We employed propensity score-weighted regression methods to examine the association between different levels of APC care during their final 9 months of life versus hospice utilization and hospitalization during their final month. RESULTSFor both nursing home- and community-dwelling beneficiaries, higher APC care involvement associated with lower hospitalization rates and higher hospice rates. DISCUSSIONAPCs are an important group of providers delivering end-of-life primary care to individuals with ADRD. HIGHLIGHTSFor both nursing home- and community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD, adjusted hospitalization rates were lower and hospice rates were higher for individuals with higher proportions of APC care involvement during their final 9 months of life.Associations between APC care involvement and both adjusted hospitalization rates and adjusted hospice rates persisted when accounting for primary care visit volume.

Earmarked Taxes for Mental Health Services in the United States: A Local and State Legal Mapping Study	MILBANK QUARTERLY			English	Article						mental health; public policy; taxation; earmarked tax; excise tax	POLICY; FEDERALISM; INSURANCE; REVENUES; ILLNESS; STIGMA	Policy PointsLocal governments are increasingly adopting policies that earmark taxes for mental health services, and approximately 30% of the US population lives in a jurisdiction with such a policy.Policies earmarking taxes for mental health services are heterogenous in their design, spending requirements, and oversight.In many jurisdictions, the annual per capita revenue generated by these taxes exceeds that of some major federal funding sources for mental health. ContextState and local governments have been adopting taxes that earmark (i.e., dedicate) revenue for mental health. However, this emergent financing model has not been systematically assessed. We sought to identify all jurisdictions in the United States with policies earmarking taxes for mental health services and characterize attributes of these taxes. MethodsA legal mapping study was conducted. Literature reviews and 11 key informant interviews informed search strings. We then searched legal databases (HeinOnline, Cheetah tax repository) and municipal data sources. We collected information on the year the tax went into effect, passage by ballot initiative (yes/no), tax base, tax rate, and revenue generated annually (gross and per capita). FindingsWe identified 207 policies earmarking taxes for mental health services (95.7% local, 4.3% state, 95.7% passed via ballot initiative). Property taxes (73.9%) and sales taxes/fees (25.1%) were most common. There was substantial heterogeneity in tax design, spending requirements, and oversight. Approximately 30% of the US population lives in a jurisdiction with a tax earmarked for mental health, and these taxes generate over $3.57 billion annually. The median per capita annual revenue generated by these taxes was $18.59 (range = $0.04-$197.09). Per capita annual revenue exceeded $25.00 in 63 jurisdictions (about five times annual per capita spending for mental health provided by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). ConclusionsPolicies earmarking taxes for mental health services are diverse in design and are an increasingly common local financing strategy. The revenue generated by these taxes is substantial in many jurisdictions.

Optimal control techniques have been extensively studied for helicopters, but these methods cannot effectively handle flight control problems since they are sensitive to uncertainties and disturbances. This paper proposes an observer-based robust optimal control scheme that enables a helicopter to fly optimally and reduce the influence of unknown model uncertainties and external disturbances. A control Lyapunov function (CLF) is firstly constructed using the backstepping method, then Sontag's formula is utilized to design an inverse optimal controller to stabilize the nominal system. Furthermore, it is stressed that the radial basis function (RBF) neural network is introduced to establish an observer with adaptive laws, approximating and compensating for the unknown model uncertainties and external disturbances to enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is ensured using the presented control approach via Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Association of Home Monitoring and Unanticipated Interstage Readmissions in Infants With Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						congenital heart disease; hospital readmission; hypoplastic left heart syndrome; interstage period; inverse probability weighted	RISK-FACTORS; PROPENSITY SCORE; MORTALITY; IMPROVEMENT; PERIOD	BackgroundThe impact of home monitoring on unanticipated interstage readmissions in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome has not been previously studied. We sought to examine the association of our institution's Infant Single Ventricle Management and Monitoring Program (ISVMP) with readmission frequency, cumulative readmission days, and readmission illness severity and to identify patient-level risk factors for readmission. Methods and ResultsWe performed a retrospective single-center cohort study comparing infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome enrolled in ISVMP (December 2010-December 2019) to historical controls (January 2007-November 2010). The primary outcome was number of readmissions per interstage days. Secondary outcomes were cumulative interstage readmission days and occurrence of severe readmissions. Inverse probability weighted and multivariable generalized linear models were used to examine the association between ISVMP and the outcomes. We compared 198 infants in the ISVMP to 128 historical controls. Infants in the ISVMP had more than double the risk of interstage readmission compared with controls (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.50-3.78]; P=0.0003). There was no difference in cumulative interstage readmission days (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.69-1.50]; P=0.90); however, infants in the ISVMP were less likely to have severe readmissions (adjusted odds ratio, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.11-0.68]; P=0.005). Other factors independently associated with number of readmissions included residing closer to our center, younger gestational age, genetic syndrome, and discharge on exclusive enteral feeds. ConclusionsInfants in the ISVMP had more frequent readmissions but comparable readmission days and fewer severe unanticipated readmissions. These findings suggest that home monitoring can reduce interstage morbidity without increasing readmission days.	[Shustak, Rachel J.

Until today PZQ is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis in human medicine and used in many combinations with antinematode drugs in veterinary medicine. The Sm.TRPMPZQ, a Ca2+ -permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, has been discovered as primary target of PZQ during the last decade. Furthermore, there is a short overview of routes of large-scale synthesis of racemic and pure (R)-PZQ. Until now racemic PZQ is used in veterinary and human medicine. In 2012 the Pediatric Praziquantel Consortium started PZQ chemistry and process development of pure (R)-PZQ for human application. It is hoped that (R)-PZQ will become available for pediatric use soon. The knowledge of the binding pocket of PZQ in Sm.TRPMPZQ allows to design synthesis of PZQ-derivatives of the next generation for a target-site directed screening. A similar screening should also be started for Fasciola hepatica TRPMPZQ.

Fluoride induces autophagy in ameloblasts, but the molecular mechanisms through which ameloblasts respond to fluoride-induced cellular stress and autophagy remain unclear. This study investigated ER stress-induced autophagy and the regulatory role of the ER molecular chaperone GRP78 in fluoride-induced autophagy in ameloblast LS8 cells. To explore the relationship between fluoride-induced ER stress and autophagy, we assessed changes in fluoride-induced autophagy in LS8 cells following overexpression and/or silencing of the ER stress molecular chaperone GRP78. We found that autophagy induced by fluoride was further increased after GRP78 overexpression in LS8 cells. Fluoride-induced autophagy was reduced in GRP78-silenced LS8 cells. Furthermore, we found that ER stress can regulate autophagy in fluoride-treated ameloblasts (LS8 cells) and that the GRP78/IRE1/TRAF2/JNK pathway is involved in the underlying regulation. Our study suggests that ER stress plays a role in fluoride-induced damage by inducing ameloblast autophagy.

Luckily, memristor emulators using mature Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) processes are good substitutes for memristors in several applications. The common setback for these emulators is their inability to retain their internal states for long periods of time. This article presents a memristive cell that not only has the memristor's characteristics but also can retain its resistance for up to 10 years. To bring forward such a cell, a charge trap in a 1 mm(2) chip is designed and fabricated using a standard 65 nm CMOS process. By characterizing the proposed trap prototype, its unexpected yet interesting behavior is revealed, such as charge tunneling that occurrs at voltages between 350 mV and 650 mV despite the process sensitivity. Next, based on the measurement results and using the VerilogAMS programming language, the charge trap to be combined with other circuits that constitute the proposed memristive cell is modeled. This model, which is partly based on previously reported models, matches the measured characteristics of the fabricated charge trap and can be easily integrated into circuit simulations.

However, the basic technique, namely, optically detected magnetic resonance to manipulate and measure single NV centers needs to be highly sped up for broad and practical applications. Here, this work shows a parallel optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) platform of single NV centers including the programmable excitation laser spots generated by a digital micromirror device, a four-channel uniform microwave delivery, and the fluorescence detector based on scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera. In the viewing field of 26 mu m, hundreds of distinguishable fluorescent spots are addressed and 413 NV center spots are recognized. The magnetic resonance spectrum, Rabi oscillation, and spin echo of each NV center spot are measured in parallel. As a result, a preliminary speedup of approximate to 20-fold is achieved compared to the confocal-based ODMR and can be further extended to thousands of folds after updating the digital micromirror device and camera.

Recent advances in the field include the utilization of programs that multiplex various signals to target different neural structures in the dorsal spinal cord associated with the painful area. Preclinical studies have been fundamental in understanding the mechanism by which this differential target multiplexed programming (DTMP) SCS approach works. Transcriptomic- and proteomic-based studies demonstrated that DTMP can modulate expression levels of genes and proteins involved in pain-related processes that have been affected by a neuropathic pain model. This work studied the effect of the intensity of DTMP signals on mechanical hypersensitivity and cell-specific transcriptomes.Methods: The spared nerve injury model (SNI) of neuropathic pain was induced in 20 animals which were 1:1 randomized into two SCS groups in which the intensity of the DTMP was adjusted to either 70% or 40% of the motor threshold (MT). SCS was applied continuously for 48 h via a quadripolar lead implanted in the dorsal epidural space of animals. Controls, which included a group of implanted SNI animals that received no SCS and a group of animals naive to the SNI, were assessed in parallel to the SCS groups. Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed before SNI, before SCS, and at 48 h of SCS. At the end of SCS, the stimulated segment of the dorsal spinal cord was dissected and subjected to RNA sequencing to quantify expression levels in all experimental groups. Differential effects were assessed via fold-change comparisons of SCS and naive groups versus the no-SCS group for transcriptomes specific to neurons and glial cells. Standard statistical analyses were employed to assess significance of the comparisons (p < 0.05).Results: SCS treatments provided significant improvement in mechanical sensitivity relative to no SCS treatment. However, the change in the intensity did not provide a significant difference in the improvement of mechanical sensitivity. DTMP regulated expression levels back toward those found in the naive group in the cell-specific transcriptomes analyzed. There were no significant differences related to the intensity of the stimulation in terms of the percentage of genes in each transcriptome in which expression levels were reversed toward the naive state.Conclusions: DTMP when applied at either 40% MT or 70% MT provided similar reduction of pain-like behavior in rats and similar effects in neuron- and glia-specific transcriptomes.

Results suggest that deficits in remote memory are primarily explained by impaired retrieval abilities in stable a-MCI and by impaired storage in converter-to-AD a-MCI. This distinction between retrograde amnesia due to defective trace utilisation in stable a-MCI and trace storage in converter a-MCI is consistent with the temporal unfolding of declining anterograde memory over the course of disease progression to AD.

Herein, an ab initio study of the KC2H8 ternary system is presented at a pressure in the range of 0-100 GPa. Its structural, electronic, dynamical, and superconducting properties are investigated, demonstrating that, at low pressure, KC2H8 is dynamically stable in a clathrate structure with space group Fm(3) over bar m and exhibits superconducting behavior with critical temperatures T-c in the range of 4-94 K. The important role played by C- and K-derived phonon modes at low frequencies and H-derived phonon modes at high frequencies is highlighted. Moreover, through the analysis of the hydrogen isotope effect, the conventional phonon-mediated pairing mechanism in this system is proved.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized comparative parallel group trials comparing IB nasal spray to placebo were included.Results: Five RCTs assessed a total of 472 participants with a diagnosis of NAR. IB nasal spray 0.03% were used across all studies. IB has a better impact on decreasing rhinorrhea than the placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.93 (95% CI 0.06-1.8). The mean change in rhinorrhea severity was 85% (95% CI 77-92%) and I(boolean AND)2 26% (p = 0.24). IB outperformed the placebo in terms of shortening the symptom's duration/day, as shown by an SMD of 0.35 (95% CI 0.15-0.55). The difference between treatments was noticeable within the first week and remained consistent throughout the treatment. Patients who were administered IB experienced a substantially greater improvement in physical and mental outcomes. Nasal adverse events with IB were generally intermittent and brief.Conclusion: Compared with a placebo, IB nasal spray is both safe and effective in treating the rhinorrhea associated with NAR. IB significantly reduces the severity and duration of rhinorrhea. The treatment was determined to be beneficial by both patients and physicians and resulted in a better quality of life.

University students with English as their L1 or L2 read passages with embedded pseudowords. In a within-participant manipulation, definitions of the pseudowords were either previewed before reading or reviewed after reading. Previewing significantly affected reading behavior on early and late eye-movement measures, and the patterns of change on the first three contextual encounters with the pseudowords differed for L1 and L2 readers. On the multiple-choice cloze posttest, encountering novel words in reading followed by definitions resulted in somewhat more accurate responses for L1 but not L2 participants. The learning condition did not affect the results of the meaning recall posttest. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between vocabulary support approaches and the reading behavior of L1 and L2 readers when they encounter unfamiliar words in texts.

J	Falótico, T; Ottoni, EB				Falotico, Tiago; Ottoni, Eduardo B.			Greater tool use diversity is associated with increased terrestriality in wild capuchin monkeys	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						ground use; primate culture; Sapajus; stone tools	BEHAVIOR	Terrestriality was an essential factor in human evolution. Hominins' extensive use of the ground allowed exploring a new range of environments and their objects, including new resources and potential tool raw materials. Capuchin monkeys are primarily arboreal primates but are also the most prolific tool users among platyrrhines, customarily using stone tools on the ground due to physical limitations and material availability.Objectives: Our goals were to (1) measure the terrestriality levels of a group of capuchin monkeys and (2) test the hypothesis that terrestriality has a positive effect on the stone tool use variability because the increased time on the ground would offer more opportunities to interact with the available stones, leading to more innovations of tool use behaviors. We predict a more diversified use of stone tools in the population with a higher degree of terrestriality.Materials and Methods: This study was on a group of capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) at Serra da Capivara National Park (SCNP), Brazil. Scan sampling was done for 23 months, recording the behavior and substrate used by the individuals.Results: The ground use rate was 41%, with no sex difference but an age difference: infants were less terrestrial than juveniles and adults.Discussion: Compared to a population with a more limited tool use repertoire (Fazenda Boa Vista), SCNP adult capuchins are more terrestrial (43% v. 27%). Stone tool use diversity and terrestriality in capuchins appear to be positively correlated. Our results support this hypothesis and provide terrestriality measurements of the wild capuchin population with the most complex stone tool kit.

However, their large open-circuit voltage (V-OC) deficit and serious photo-induced halide segregation remain the main challenges that impede their applications. Herein, a post-treatment strategy without thermal annealing is presented to form a 2D top layer of 2-thiopheneethylammonium lead halide (n = 1) on WBG perovskites. This thermal annealing-free post-treatment method can more effectively passivate the defects of WBG methylamine (MA)-free formamidinium/cesium lead iodide/bromide perovskite films and suppress photo-induced perovskite phase segregation, as compared with the thermal annealing method that yields multi-2D phases. The resulting opaque and semi-transparent 1.66 eV-bandgap perovskite solar cells deliver maximum power conversion efficiencies of 21.47% (a small V-OC deficit of 0.43 V) and 19.11%, respectively, both of which are among the highest reports for inverted MA-free WBG PSCs. Consequently, four-terminal all-perovskite tandem cells realize a remarkable efficiency of 26.64%, showing great promise for their applications in efficient multi-junction tandem solar cells.

We review 13 alternative approaches for applying 12 criteria to establish causality. Strength of causal inference is greater when more causal criteria are applied so we propose a scaffolding set of criteria to clearly establish causality. We recommend validating predicted outcomes of wildlife management efforts when predictions are based on a unique mechanism and temporality, especially when manipulative experimental studies are not feasible. We use 3 case studies, namely of lamb predation by feral pigs (Sus scrofa), causes of trends in northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), and causes of trends in mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), to illustrate these topics, which are of wide relevance in wildlife management. We recommend greater use of causality and relative strength of causal inference to improve adaptive wildlife management.

They showed an acceptable ADME profile (in silico) and can be considered as drug-like. In experiments in vivo (CD-1 mice), it was found that the obtained compounds do not have toxic properties at a dose of more than 150 mg/kg (for most compounds at a dose of >300 mg/kg, and for lead compounds - >600 mg/kg). 22 Compounds from this series demonstrated from moderate to high analgesic effects (28-104 % at 1 h and 37-109 % at 2 h after administration) in vivo in the hot plate test (SD rats, 15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (ip)). The lead compound was 4-([1-phenyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazol-5-yl]oxy)butan-1-ol, which not only increased the latent period in the hot plate test by 103 % at both measurement points but also showed a pronounced analgesic effect under conditions of capsaicin-induced nociception (CD-1 mice, 15 mg/kg, ip). According to molecular modeling, all synthesized compounds can interact with the TRPV1 ion channel. This biological target was confirmed in in vitro experiments on Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing rTRPV1. 5-Alkoxypyrazoles were partial agonists of the TRPV1 ion channel in various degree, and the most active was the same pyrazole as in in vivo tests.

This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers in disease monitoring and differential diagnosis of adult SMA patients with sporadic ALS patients. Methods: This was a pilot study with ten adult SMA patients and ten ALS patients consecutively enrolled during hospitalization. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected for assessment of neurofilament light (NFL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH). Serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatinine (Cr) were also compared between groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify differentiated values among ALS and SMA patients. Results: Serum Cr, CSF NFL, and CSF pNFH levels of ALS patients were significantly higher than those of the adult SMA patients (p < .01). Serum CK and Cr were strongly correlated with baseline ALSFRS-R scores in SMA patients (p < .001). The ROC curves revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 in serum Cr with a cut-off value of 44.5 mu mol/L (Sensitivity 90%, Specificity 90%). AUC from the ROC curve of CSF NFL and CSF pNFH were 1.0 and 0.84, with cut-off values of 1275 pg/mL and 0.395 ng/mL, respectively (Sensitivity and Specificity of 100% and 100% in CSF NFL; Sensitivity and Specificity of 90% and 80% in CSF pNFH). Conclusion: CSF NFL and pNFH might be useful biomarkers for differential diagnosis of adult SMA and ALS.

In this work, a simple, surfactant-free, and covalent strategy to stabilize liquid in precise nonequilibrium shapes via fast interfacial polymerization (FIP) of highly reactive n-butyl cyanoacrylate (BCA) monomer triggered by water-soluble nucleophiles is described. Full interfacial coverage can be achieved instantly, and the resultant polyBCA film anchored at the interface can support the unequal interface stress, which allows the production of non-spherical droplets with complex shapes. Notably, the formulation of internal aqueous phase is nearly unaffected since no specific additive is required. Moreover, considering the excellent biocompatibility of BCA and polyBCA, the produced droplets can be used as micro-bioreactor for enzyme catalysis and even bacterial culture, which well mimic the morphology of cells and bacteria to achieve the biochemical reaction in non-spherical droplets. The present work not only opens a new sight for the stabilization of liquid in nonequilibrium shapes, but may also promote the development of synthetic biology based on non-spherical droplets, and tremendous potential applications are anticipated.

Unsubstituted 4-positions give rise to the generation of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes by deprotonation. Preparations of new sydnone methides are described here. They can be represented by mesomeric structures with either exocyclic carbanionic groups like -C(CN)(2)(-), -C(CN)(COOMe)(-), -C(CN)(CONH2)(-), and -C(CN)(SO2Me)(-), or with the corresponding exocyclic C=C double bonds as a common feature with mesoionic N-heterocyclic olefins. An X-ray single structure analysis revealed a length of 140.7(3) pm of the exocyclic bond in the solid state. From the coalescence temperature (55 degrees C) determined by a series of C-13 NMR experiments (150 MHz) at various temperatures, an energy of rotation of 18.5 Kcal/mol was calculated for this bond. The C-13 NMR signals of the anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes, from which the 2-mesityl-substituted anionic NHC proved to be stable up to 10 ?, are highly shifted upfield (d(carbene)=157.9 ppm-160.5 ppm). The carbenes can be reacted in situ with elemental selenium and chlorophosphanes to yield sydnone methide selenoethers after methylation and 4-phosphanylsydnone methides in good to excellent yields, respectively.

J	Saglam, FS; Bektas, H				Saglam, Fatma Sinem; Bektas, Hicran			Risk perceptions of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus regarding insulin therapy and diabetes complications: A cross-sectional study	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article						diabetes complications; insulin; nursing; risk perception; type 2 diabetes mellitus	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; BARRIERS; RESISTANCE; INITIATION; CHINESE; URBAN; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIORS; ATTITUDES	Aims: This study was conducted to determine the risk perceptions of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) regarding insulin therapy and diabetes complications. Background: Self-care behaviour is an important requirement for managing T2DM, and risk perceptions are thought to play a key role in this behavioural process. It is predicted that an accurate risk perception will contribute to diabetes management and the reduction in diabetes-related complications. Design: This study was conducted as cross-sectional and a descriptive study. The STROBE checklist was used. Methods: The study was conducted with 330 patients with T2DM who presented to the endocrinology outpatient clinic of the Eskisehir City Hospital between October 2020 and May 2021. A personal information form, the Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale and the Risk Perception Survey-Diabetes Mellitus were used to collect data. The SAS 9.4 software package was used for the statistical analysis. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Spearman correlation analysis. Results: It was determined that 62.4% of the patients with T2DM participating in the study were female, the mean age was 56.7 +/- 9.1 years, 50.6% were primary school graduates, 31% used oral antidiabetic medications, and 58.7% used insulin together with oral antidiabetic drugs. The mean score of participants on the total Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale was 75.1 +/- 11.5, and the level of negative perceptions towards insulin use was found to be high. The participants' mean score on the total Risk Perception Survey-Diabetes Mellitus was 3.9 +/- 0.8, and it was found that they had high levels of risk perceptions of diabetes complications. There was a moderate, statistically significant negative correlation between the Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale and the Risk Perception Survey-Diabetes Mellitus. Conclusion: Patients with perceptions of a lower risk for diabetes complications had more negative attitudes towards insulin therapy. It is recommended to determine the risk perceptions of patients with T2DM and to plan appropriate nursing interventions that can increase their positive perceptions and change their negative perceptions so that they can make healthy behaviour changes. Additionally, it is recommended that patients with T2DM should be supported and the number of studies in this field should be increased. Relevance to clinical practice: The effective management of diabetes requires cooperation between patients with T2DM and health professionals. Nurses should perform a constant evaluation and follow-up to address patients' knowledge, perception and actual health behaviours and to guide a culturally and gender-sensitive care plan. For individualised care plans that provide appropriate support and counselling, it is necessary to constantly assess risk factors and barriers to preventive health behaviours and perceptions. No patient or public contribution: Patients with T2DM contributed their data to the study.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large fluid intensity lesion (T2W hyperintense to muscle, T1W hypointense and in both sequences isointense to joint fluid) centred on the medial aspect of the right shoulder joint with outpouching into the surrounding muscle. On post-contrast T1W images, there was extensive enhancement of the synovium and of the outpouching within the subscapularis muscle (centrally non-enhancing consistent with abscessation, haemorrhage or necrosis). Bacteriological culture and sensitivity testing on fluid of the shoulder joint and lesion revealed monoculture of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This case report illustrates the value of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal pathology.

These different heteroatom-based supramolecular compounds have inspired us to examine the noncovalent interaction in the isolated host and host-guest complexes. In view of this, in the current manuscript, we investigated the stability and torsional energy barrier of different conformers of the ditopic receptor host 1,6-bis(2,6-bis(benzothiazol-2-yl) pyridine-4-yloxy) hexane (bbh). The conformer that is accompanied by intramolecular C-(HN)-N-. . . and C-(HS)-S-. . . interactions is relatively more stable than the others. Due to torsional angle rotation within the host, the C-(HN)-N-. . . and C-(HS)-S-. . . interactions get disrupted and exhibit different binding sites for capturing guest molecules. In addition, we have extended the investigation to understand the interaction energy and nature of interaction in host-guest (1 : 1 and 1 : 2) complexes formed between the host (bbh) and guest (resorcinol) by using different DFT functionals. Extended transition state-natural orbital chemical valence (ETS-NOCV) analysis of complexes revealed that the electrostatic interaction significantly contributes to the host-guest interaction energy. The noncovalent (NCI) analysis provides the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and other weak interactions within the complexes.

An emulsion was formed using the membrane material, where anhydrous milk fat was used as the core material, milk fat globule membrane polar lipid (MPL) as the emulsifier, and soybean phospholipid (PL) and milk protein concentrate (MPC) incorporated as control emulsifiers. Structural characterization, glyceride composition, and fatty acid release from emulsions by in vitro digestion were investigated. RESULTS: The average particle size at the end of intestinal digestion was in the order MPL < PL < MPC, with diameters of 3.41 +/- 0.51 mu m, 3.53 +/- 0.47 mu m, and 10.46 +/- 2.33 mu m respectively. Meanwhile, laser scanning confocal microscopy results also illustrated that MPL could reduce the degree of aggregation during digestion. The lipolysis degree of MPL emulsion was higher than that of PL and MPC emulsions. MPL not only released higher levels of long-chain fatty acids, such as C18:1, C18:2, C18:3, which are of great significance for infant growth and development, but also released increased levels of C20:4 (arachidonic acid) and C22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid) than PL and MPC emulsions did. CONCLUSION: Fat droplets enveloped by milk fat globule MPLs were easier to digest and are therefore more suitable for infant formula . (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Obesity medications can help with this, increasing long-term dietary compliance by promoting satiety or reducing hunger. However, efficacy and safety of obesity medications vary for individuals. Early identification of non-responders to obesity medications may limit drug exposure while optimizing benefits for responders. This review summarizes factors that impact weight-loss response to liraglutide. Factors linked to greater weight loss on liraglutide include being female, not having diabetes, having relatively high baseline weight, and losing at least 4% of initial weight after 16 weeks of treatment. Other covariates that may predict treatment response but require further confirmation include central effects, nausea, gastric emptying of solids, and genotype. Baseline body mass index, race, and age seem less relevant for predicting weight-loss response to liraglutide. Lesser known and harder-to-measure factors such as cerebral blood flow, food cue reactivity, gut hormone levels, and dietary adherence possibly impact variability of response to liraglutide. This information should assist healthcare providers with establishing realistic weight-loss probability for individual patients. Future research should improve the ability to identify responders to liraglutide. Importantly, this review may provide a framework to identify responders to other obesity medications.

Construction of a novel versatile dressing with good anti-infection and healing-promoting abilities is greatly expected. In this paper, nature-source-based composite microspheres with dual antibacterial mechanisms and bioadhesive features by microfluidics electrospray for infected wound healing is developed. The microspheres enable sustained release of copper ions, which not only show long-term antibacterial properties, but also play important role in wound-healing-related angiogenesis. Additionally, the microspheres are coated with polydopamine via self-polymerization, which renders the microspheres adhesive to the wound surface, and further enhance the antibacterial ability through photothermal energy conversion. Based on the dual antibacterial strategies provided by copper ions and polydopamine as well as the bioadhesive property, the composite microspheres exhibit excellent anti-infection and wound healing performances in a rat wound model. These results, along with the nature-source-based composition and biocompatibility, indicate the great potential of the microspheres in clinical wound repair.

During our studies on two isostructural metal-organic frameworks (Ni-MOF 1 and Ni-MOF 2), we found that Ni-MOF 2 exhibited significantly higher performance for C2H6/C2H4 separation than Ni-MOF-1, as clearly established by gas sorption isotherms and breakthrough experiments. Density-Functional Theory (DFT) studies showed that the unblocked unique aromatic pore surfaces within Ni-MOF 2 induce more and stronger C-H center dot center dot center dot pi with C2H6 over C2H4 while the suitable pore spaces enforce its high C2H6 uptake capacity, featuring Ni-MOF 2 as one of the best porous materials for this very important gas separation. It generates 12 L kg(-1) of polymer-grade C2H4 product from equimolar C2H6/C2H4 mixtures at ambient conditions.

Herein, we report a bacterial system for the simultaneous detection and selection of protease activity on positive and negative target substrates. The system, based on Proteolysis-triggered bActerial SuiCide and Antibiotic Resistance (PASCAR) in Escherichia coli, exploits the beta-lactamase and the human gasdermin D (GS) for the proteolysis-responsive positive and negative selections, respectively. The applicability of the positive selection was illustrated with the directed evolution of the Tobacco etch virus protease toward the recognition of non-native substrates. We also utilized the positive selection for the efficient evaluation of computationally redesigned protease variants. We constructed and optimized a series of GS mutants as suicide modules - with high to low selection stringencies that would enable the use of PASCAR as a practically applicable dual selection system. This study provides a simple and easily accessible tool that facilitates the engineering of proteases with custom specificity and selectivity.

Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care government hospital. Patients: Photographic records of 100 patients with complete UCL +/- P from the age group of 5-18 years (mean age-12.2 +/- 3.93 years) were included in this study. Method: Photographic records of 100 patients with complete UCL +/- P from the age group of 5-18 years were included. A panel of 3 orthodontists, 3 laypersons and 3 cleft patients rated nasolabial aesthetics using 2 scoring systems i.e. Asher-McDade index (AMAI) and Cleft Aesthetic Rating Scale (CARS). Spearman's split-half reliability, Intra-class correlation coefficient and Cronbach's alpha were computed to measure internal consistency and reliability. Inter-panel agreement between pair of groups was determined by means of Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: Estimated reliability of CARS for 3 raters in each panel was in moderate agreement for orthodontists and cleft patients (0.849 and 0.810). Good repeatability and agreement were recorded with moderate to high intra-panel reliability for all parameters of both AMAI and CARS. Overall inter-panel agreement was moderate for both AMAI and CARS. Pair -wise inter-panel agreement showed a moderately positive correlation in both scales (AMAI and CARS) by cleft patients and professionals. Conclusion: CARS index can be reliably used for assessment of nasolabial aesthetics by cleft patients, professionals and lay persons on 2D facial photographs. Patients were more critical than clinicians and laypersons using both indices (CARS and AMAI) as they are more self-aware and conscious. Thus, a clear communication between clinician and patient regarding expectations, perception and satisfaction with surgical results is strongly recommended.

Outcomes of DCIS treated with breast conserving surgery without radiotherapy on recurrence, survival, and health-related quality of life	ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						breast cancer; breast conserving surgery; DCIS; health-related quality of life; sector resection	CARCINOMA-IN-SITU; PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS; SURGICAL TECHNIQUE; SECTOR RESECTION; PROTOCOL B-17; CANCER; WOMEN; MORTALITY; THERAPY; SWEDCIS	Background: Sector resection for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) allows wide excision without compromising breast shape. There are concerns that radiotherapy for some DCIS after sector resection is unnecessary and reduces patient satisfaction and quality of life without affecting survival. This study aimed to investigate whether women with DCIS managed with sector resection without radiotherapy had acceptable rates of recurrence and health-related quality of life outcomes.Methods: Retrospective study of patients who underwent sector resection for DCIS without adjuvant radiotherapy from 1992 to 2021. Tumour size, grade, necrosis, margins, follow up and time to ipsilateral recurrence was recorded. Patients were posted a BREAST-Q to assess health-related quality of life.Results: One hundred and thirty-eight patients were treated for pure DCIS by two surgeons from 1992 to 2018. One hundred and sixteen patients underwent sector resection, 22 had mastectomy. Average age 61 years. Mean follow up 9.14 years. Recurrence rate after sector resection was 18.97%. 55% were DCIS. Annualized recurrence rate was 2.07%. There were no cancer-related deaths. BREAST-Q completion rate was 44%. Satisfaction with breasts, physical, psychosocial, and sexual well-being scores were significantly higher than normative Australian values and a mixed cohort of women who underwent breast conserving surgery with radiotherapy.Conclusion: DCIS can be safely managed with sector resection without radiotherapy and regular long-term follow up. This approach results in low annualized recurrence rates, high levels patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life and should be considered a safe alternative for patients with DCIS to minimize morbidity without affecting cancer survival.

However, the precise role of HMGB1 in ischemic stroke remains to be elucidated.Methods: Comprehensive literature search and narrative review to summarize the current field of HMGB1 in cerebral ischemic based on the basic structure, structural modification, and functional roles of HMGB1 described in the literature.Results: Studies have exhibited the crucial roles of HMGB1 in cell death, immunity and inflammation, thrombosis, and remodeling and repair. HMGB1 released after cerebral infarction is extensively involved in the pathological injury process in the early stage of cerebral infarction, whereas it is involved in the promotion of brain tissue repair and remodeling in the late stage of cerebral infarction. HMGB1 plays a neurotrophic role in acute white matter stroke, whereas it causes sustained activation of inflammation and plays a damaging role in chronic white matter ischemia.Conclusions: HMGB1 plays a complex role in cerebral infarction, which is related to not only the modification of HMGB1 and bound receptors but also different stages and subtypes of cerebral infarction. future studies on HMGB1 should investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of HMGB1 after cerebral infarction. Moreover, future studies on HMGB1 should attempt to integrate different stages and infarct subtypes of cerebral infarction.

This study compared the prevalence of bacterial contamination on touchscreens and posterior surfaces of smartphones owned by HCWs.MethodA cross-sectional study of smartphones used by HCWs working at an emergency department (ED) at a Japanese tertiary care hospital was conducted. Bacteria on each surface of the smartphones were isolated separately. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the prevalence of microbial contamination on each surface of the smartphones and the types of associated bacterial species. Fisher's exact test was used to compare dichotomous outcomes.ResultsThe smartphones of 40 HCWs working in the ED of a Japanese tertiary care hospital were examined. The touchscreens and posterior surfaces were contaminated in 26 (65.0%) and 36 (90.0%) smartphones, respectively, indicating the posterior surface was more frequently contaminated (p = 0.014).

To homogenize the AMH values, we converted those obtained after 2015. We defined PCOM with strict criteria: a follicle number per ovary (FNPO) =12 or=20 per ovary, depending on the date on which the assessment was carried out and the ultrasound device.Results: Forty-two percentage of our FHA population had PCOM. The PCOM+ group had significantly higher ranks of BMI (p = .024) and serum AMH levels (p = .0001) and significantly lower ranks of serum FSH levels (p = .002). LH was positively correlated with fasting insulin (p = .011) and with AMH (p = .035) in the PCOM+ group only but not with BMI. There was a positive correlation between LH and FSH in both groups.Conclusion: Our study suggests that GnRH insufficiency in women with PCOM unravels some mechanisms of LH regulation that are poorly documented in the literature and may involve a direct pituitary effect, as suggested by our results with serum insulin and AMH levels.

Background: The mini--implant overdenture emphasises the advantages of simplicity using flapless surgery and immediate loading. However, some mini--implant have lowe initial stability. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 participants who used mandibular MIODs and maxillary removable complete dentures (RCDs) over 4 years were included. Four one-piece mini--implants (<3 mm in diameter) were placed by a flapless surgical approach after fabrication of new RCDs, and the O--ring attachment was attached at least 8 weeks after implant placement. Results: The average observation period was 58.9 +/- 9.2 months after mini--implant loading. The survival rate of the implants was 100.0%, and the overall change in mean marginal bone level (Delta MBL) was -0.9 +/- 1.1 mm. The implant success rate was 83.3% at the implant level, and 66.7% at the patient level. The mean initial Periotest value was 0.9 +/- 3.1, and it was positively associated with Delta MBL and implant success (P <.05). Patient satisfaction improved after conversion from RCDs to MIODs (P <.05), and mastication and pain showed greater satisfaction with longer loading time (P <.05). Conclusions: The mandibular MIODs could be chosen as an alternative treatment under a two--step immediate--loading protocol in edentulous patients with limited alveolar bone volume. To ensure superior treatment outcomes of MIODs, initial stability of implant must be obtained using as wide a diameter as possible within the anatomically allowable limits.

While the popularity of this model species is rapidly increasing, we need to improve our understanding of how the species interacts with its environment to optimize its husbandry. Specifically, turquoise killifish are substrate spawners that bury their eggs in the sediment, which can be accommodated under captive conditions, but it is not yet known whether or not turquoise killifish have a preference for a specific sediment colour. Here, we performed a laboratory experiment in which fish could choose between white, orange and black sand for spawning, colours which are relevant in both laboratory and field conditions. We assessed their preference in the context of single breeding pairs, as well as in a social group setting. Additionally, we also assessed the preference of individuals for a white versus black background in a nonmating context. Single breeding pairs deposited over 3.5 times more eggs in black compared to orange or white sand. Similarly, fish in social groups deposited over 3.5 times more eggs in black compared to orange sand, which in turn was over two times higher than that in white sand. Fish showed a slight preference for the black compared to the white zone in a nonmating context, but this did not correlate with substrate choice during the spawning tests. The results suggest that turquoise killifish select their preferred spawning location based on the colour of the substrate. These findings contribute to our understanding of the species' biology and can help to guide good welfare and scientific practice.	[Thore, Eli S.

However, its effects and mechanism of action have not yet been clarified. It has been reported that cerebral I/R injury is closely associated not only with ferroptosis but also with inflammation. Hence, the current study aimed to investigate whether high-frequency rTMS attenuates middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral I/R injury and further to elucidate the mediatory role of ferroptosis and inflammation. Methods: The protective effects of rTMS on experimental cerebral I/R injury were investigated using transient MCAO model rats. Neurological scores and pathological changes of cerebral ischemic cortex were assessed to evaluate the effects of rTMS on cerebral I/R injury. The involvement of ferroptosis and that of inflammation were examined to investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of rTMS. Results: High-frequency rTMS remarkably rescued the MCAO-induced neurological deficits and morphological damage. rTMS treatment also increased the mRNA and protein expression of glutathione-dependent peroxidase 4, decreased the mRNA and protein levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 and transferrin receptor in the cortex. Moreover, rTMS administration reduced the cerebrospinal fluid IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha concentrations. Conclusion: These findings implicated that high-frequency rTMS alleviates MCAO-induced cerebral I/R injury, and the underlying mechanism could involve the inhibition of ferroptosis and inflammation. Our study identifies rTMS as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury. Moreover, the mechanistic insights into ferroptosis and inflammation advance our understanding of it as a potential therapeutic target for diseases beyond cerebral ischemia stroke.

Researchers continue, however, to preferentially use comparative and functional approaches to examine complex traits, but these methods cannot address questions about evolutionary process and often conflate function with fitness. Moreover, researchers also tend to examine anatomical elements in isolation, which implicitly assumes independent evolution among different body regions. In this paper, we argue that questions asked in primate evolution are best examined using multiple anatomical regions subjected to model-bound methods built from an understanding of evolutionary quantitative genetics. A nascent but expanding number of studies over the last two decades use this approach, examining morphological integration, evolvability, and selection modeling. To help readers learn how to use these methods, we review fundamentals of evolutionary processes within a quantitative genetic framework, explore the importance of neutral evolutionary theory, and explain the basics of evolutionary quantitative genetics, namely the calculation of evolutionary potential for multiple traits in response to selection. Leveraging these methods, we demonstrate their use to understand non-independence in possible evolutionary responses across the limbs, limb girdles, and basicranium of humans. Our results show that model-bound quantitative genetic methods can reveal unexpected genetic covariances among traits that create a novel but measurable understanding of evolutionary complexity among multiple traits. We advocate for evolutionary quantitative genetic methods to be a standard whenever appropriate to keep studies of primate morphological evolution relevant for the next seventy years and beyond.

A device for swift reagent ion switching in CI mode between consecutive runs is presented. MethodsVOCs emitted from the investigated material were sampled onto Tenax (R) absorption tubes using micro emission chambers and subsequently injected into the GC through thermal desorption. The detector was a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) simultaneously operating in EI and CI modes during a single chromatographic run. A custom permeation tube setup allowed for swift selection between various reagent ions in CI mode, e.g., [N2H](+), [H3O](+), [(H2O)(2)H](+), and [NH4](+). ResultsDifferent reagent ions are swiftly selectable between single GC runs without hardware changes. Differences in precursor ion survival yields and the selectivity of the various reactants were carefully assessed. Several examples for the improved identification of unknown compounds with the available complementary and comprehensive EI&CI data set are demonstrated for a relevant material emission application. ConclusionThe presented technique provides additional value to the standard GC-EI/MS procedure commonly used for material emission characterization. It allows for a non-targeted analysis approach with moderate analysis time.

The sharply nonlinear drop-off in photoneutron production below 10 MV to negligible at 6 MV has scarcely been characterized quantitatively, yet can elucidate important practical insights.Purpose: To measure photoneutron yields in a medical linac at 8 MV, which may strike a reasonable balance between usefully increased beam penetration and dose rate as compared to 6 MV while reducing photoneutron production which is present at 10 MV.Methods: A Varian iX linear accelerator undergoing decommissioning at our clinic was made to operate over a range of photon energies between 6 and 15 MV by calibrating the bending magnet and adjusting other beam generation parameters. Neutron dose within the treatment room was measured using an Anderson-Braun type detector over a continuum of intermediate energies.Results: The photoneutron production for energies below 10 MV was measured, adding to data that is otherwise scarce in the literature. Our results are consistent with previously published results for neutron yield. We found that the photoneutron production at 8 MV was about 1/10 of the value at 10 MV, and about 10 times higher than detector background at 6 MV.Conclusions: Photoneutron production drops off below 10 MV, but is still present at 8 MV. An 8 MV beam is more penetrating than a 6 MV beam, and may offer a suitable tradeoff for modern radiotherapy techniques such as VMAT, SRS, and SABR. Further studies are needed to better understand the impact on treatment plan quality between 8 and 10 MV beams considering the benefits to facility requirements and non-therapeutic patient dose.

Assessment of flaws in cold-sintered ZnO via acoustic wave speed and attenuation measurements	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article						characterization; defects; sinter; sintering; ultrasonics; zinc oxide	ULTRASONIC-ATTENUATION; ZINC-OXIDE; POROSITY; DENSIFICATION; COMPOSITES; STRENGTH	The cold sintering process (CSP) is a low temperature processing technique that utilizes a transient phase to synthesize dense ceramics. However, some CSP parts contain microflaws that arise due to inhomogeneities in pressure, temperature, and transient phase. This work uses 20 MHz ultrasound to verify the presence of defects in CSP ZnO samples of varying densities (84%-97%). Acoustic metrics used in this work include wave speed, which is affected by differences in the effective elastic properties of the medium, and attenuation, which quantifies wave energy loss due to scattering from defects. Wave speed maps were inhomogeneous, suggesting density gradients which were verified with scanning electron microscopy. In addition, it was demonstrated that the pores produced by cold sintering are anisometric, which increases the anisotropy in the elastic properties. High attenuation regions (>300 Np/m) are present in all samples independent of relative density and correspond to defects identified in X-ray computed tomography (XCT) which were as small as 38 mu m in effective diameter. However, some high attenuation spots do not correspond to visible defects in XCT, which suggests the presence of features undetectable with XCT such as residual secondary phases at the grain boundaries.

Instead, it is defined over a finite degree extension of its field of moduli, called a field of definition. We show that given a number m, there exists a Belyi pair such that the degree of a field of definition over the field of moduli is greater than m. As a byproduct, we obtain a counterexample to the local-global principle for Belyi pairs.

N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin-I, and point-of-care ultrasound in dogs with cardiac and noncardiac causes of nonhemorrhagic ascites	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE			English	Article						BNP; canine; congestive heart failure; echocardiography	CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; PERICARDIAL-EFFUSION; MARKERS; DIAGNOSIS; FLUID; CATS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; DIFFERENTIATION; DYSFUNCTION; BIOMARKERS	Background: Nonhemorrhagic ascites (NHA) can be caused by cardiac diseases (cNHA) and noncardiac diseases (ncNHA). N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin-I (cTnI), and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may differentiate between cNHA and ncNHA. Hypothesis/Objectives: We compared NT-proBNP and cTnI concentrations as well as POCUS findings in dogs presented with cNHA and ncNHA. Animals: Dogs (n = 60) were enrolled based on identification of NHA with an effusion packed cell volume < 10%. Methods: Blood samples were collected and POCUS was performed on all dogs. Dogs were diagnosed with cNHA (n = 28) or ncNHA (n = 32) based on echocardiography. The cNHA group was subdivided into cardiac non-pericardial disease (n = 17) and pericardial disease (n = 11). Results: The NT-proBNP concentration (median; range pmol/L) was significantly higher in the cNHA group (4510; 250-10 000) compared to the ncNHA group (739.5; 250-10 000; P =.01), with a sensitivity of 53.8% and specificity of 85.7% using a cut-off of 4092 pmol/L. The NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in the cardiac non-pericardial disease group (8339; 282-10 000) compared with the pericardial disease group (692.5; 250-4928; P =.002). A significant difference in cTnI concentration (median; range ng/L) between the cNHA group (300; 23-112 612) and ncNHA group (181; 17-37 549) was not detected (P =.41). A significantly higher number of dogs had hepatic venous and caudal vena cava distension in the cNHA group compared to the ncNHA group, respectively (18/28 vs 3/29, P <.0001 and 13/27 vs 2/29, P <.001). Gall bladder wall edema was not significantly different between groups (4/28 vs 3/29, P =.74). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: NT-proBNP concentration and POCUS help distinguish between cNHA and ncNHA.	[Morey, Alice G. N.; Karnia, James J. J.; Wiggen, Kelly E. E.; Lyons, Bridget M.

Only the extra-label use in rabbits is possible. Levofloxacin is not labelled for veterinary use in the EU or the USA. The activity of levofloxacin against rabbit pathogens Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined in broth and serum for 10 P. multocida isolates and 5 E. coli isolates from rabbits. One isolate of each bacterial species was used for the time-killing curve study in vitro and ex vivo. In vitro AUC(24)/MIC ratios were used for building the inhibitory pharmacodynamic I-max model. The P. multocida MIC were 0.008-0.5 mu g/mL, MBC -0.015-0.5 mu g/mL. Escherichia coli MIC was 0.008-0.03 mu g/mL and MBC -0.03-0.25 mu g/mL. Bacterial counts were reduced to the limit of detection after 24 h with levofloxacin concentrations of 2 MIC and higher. All serum samples from rabbits treated with levofloxacin eliminated the bacteria within 24 h. AUC(24)/MIC ratios for bacteriostatic, bactericidal and bacterial elimination effects for P. multocida and E. coli isolates were 21, 29 and 75 h and 27, 32 and 60 h, respectively. Proposed daily doses against P. multocida (MIC = 0.015 mu g/mL) and E. coli (MIC = 0.03 mu g/mL) isolates were calculated as <= 0.91 and <= 1.43 mg/kg, respectively. Fluoroquinolones are categorized by WHO as 'highest priority critically important antimicrobials'. Considering the increasing importance of antimicrobial stewardship, antimicrobials from a lower importance category that are active against the isolate of interest should be used in preference to fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolone use in veterinary medicine should be based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing in order to mitigate the risk to public health and prevent the spread of bacterial resistance.

However, the mechanism that induces mortality of N. lugens remains elusive. RESULTS: In the present study, the insecticidal activities of 14 fungicides against N. lugens were determined, of which tebuconazole had the highest insecticidal activity compared with the other fungicides. Furthermore, tebuconazole significantly inhibited the expression of the chitin synthase gene NlCHS1; the chitinase genes NlCht1, NlCht5, NlCht7, NlCht9, and NlCht10; and the beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase genes NlHex3, NlHex4, NlHex5 and NlHex6; it significantly suppressed the expression of ecdysteroid biosynthetic genes as well, including SDR, CYP307A2, CYP307B1, CYP306A2, CYP302A1, CYP315A1 and CYP314A1 of N. lugens. Additionally, tebuconazole affected the diversity, structure, composition, and function of the symbiotic fungi of N. lugens, as well as the relative abundance of saprophytes and pathogens, suggesting that tebuconazole reshapes the diversity and function of symbiotic fungi of N. lugens. CONCLUSION: Our findings illustrate the insecticidal mechanism of tebuconazole, possibly by inhibiting normal molting or disrupting microbial homeostasis in N. lugens, and provide an important rationale for developing novel insect management strategies to delay escalating insecticide resistance.

Design and analysis of such distributed systems are complicated by the many interactions among agents and phenomena of human behavior. In particular, human susceptibility to fatigue and cognitive overload can introduce errors and uncertainty into the system. In this paper, we demonstrate how advanced computational tools can help to overcome these engineering difficulties by optimizing multirobot, multioperator surveillance systems for cost, speed, accuracy, and stealth according to diverse user preferences in multiple case studies. The tool developed is a graphical user interface that returns the optimal number and mix of diverse agent types as a function of the user's trade-off preferences. System performance prediction relies on a multiagent simulation with submodels for human operators, fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), quadrotor UAVs, and flapping wing UAVs combined in different numbers.

The plant receptor-like kinase FERONIA is widely reported to be involved in abiotic stresses. However, its function in apple cold resistance remains unknown. Modification of cell wall components and accumulation of soluble sugars and amino acids are important strategies by which plants cope with cold. In this study, expression of the apple FERONIA receptor-like kinase gene MdMRLK2 was rapidly induced by cold. Apple plants overexpressing MdMRLK2 (35S:MdMRLK2) showed enhanced cold resistance relative to the wild type. Under cold conditions, 35S:MdMRLK2 apple plants had higher amounts of water insoluble pectin, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, which may have resulted from reduced activities of polygalacturonase, pectinate lyase, pectinesterase, and cellulase. More soluble sugars and free amino acids and less photosystem damage were also observed in 35S:MdMRLK2 apple plants. Intriguingly, MdMRLK2 interacted with the transcription factor MdMYBPA1 and promoted its binding to MdANS and MdUFGT promoters, leading to more anthocyanin biosynthesis, particularly under cold conditions. These findings complemented the function of apple FERONIA MdMRLK2 responding to cold resistance.

Bank on it: Do Local Banks Contribute to Rural Community Prosperity?	RURAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article							ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; US; CREDIT; BUSINESSES; COMPETITION; EMPLOYMENT; AMENITIES; INDUSTRY; CONSOLIDATION	Recent research on the restructuring of the financial industry from local banks to interstate conglomerates has raised questions about the impact on nonmetropolitan economies. In this paper, we develop two competing hypotheses and scrutinize the impact of local bank concentration (percent banks that are locally headquartered) on four measures of economic growth from 1980 to 2010 in metropolitan, micropolitan, and non-core Commuting Zones (CZs). We employ fixed effects panel regression models for the 1980-2010 time frame. We find that local bank concentration is positively related to business births and establishment dynamics in non-core and micropolitan CZs. The effects of local banking on measures of income and wages fail to show consistent effects. There are no positive local banking concentration effects on economic growth in metropolitan CZs during this time frame. Implications for theory, research, and policy are discussed.	[Mencken, F.

The investor faces a moral-hazard problem since the entrepreneur may divert the funding for private consumption. I find that the efficient amount of information is generated if and only if the bargaining power of the entrepreneur is high enough. I interpret this result in terms of investors' tightness, competitiveness, and generosity measures. I also show that the investor prefers not to have all the bargaining power when the project costs are high enough.

Published work demonstrates that MUC6 can also be expressed in several cancer types and can aid in the distinction of different tumor entities. To systematically analyze MUC6 expression in normal and cancerous tissues, a tissue microarray containing 15 412 samples from 119 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. At least a weak MUC6 positivity was seen in 50 of 119 (42%) tumor entities. Thirty-three tumor entities included tumors with strong positivity. MUC6 immunostaining was most frequent in mucinous carcinomas of the breast (44%), adenocarcinomas of the stomach (30%-40%) and esophagus (35%), and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the colon. Strong MUC6 staining was linked to advanced pT stage (p = 0.0464), defective mismatch repair status and right-sided tumor location (p <0.0001 each) in colorectal cancer, as well as to high tumor grade (p = 0.0291), nodal metastasis (p = 0.0485), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 positivity (p < 0.0001) and negative estrogen receptor (p = 0.0332)/progesterone receptor (p = 0.0257) status in breast carcinomas of no special type. The broad range of tumor types with MUC6 expression limits the utility of MUC6 immunohistochemistry for the distinction of different tumor types.	[Rico, Sebastian Dwertmann; Schliesser, Sebastian J.

Nurses were selected using the purposive sampling method. Additionally, to reach a sufficient sample size, snowball sampling was applied. Each interview was pseudonymized and transcribed. Transcripts were coded according to Qualitative Content Analysis with data structured into themes and sub-themes. The study was reported according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) checklist for qualitative research.Results: Two main themes including sub-themes were identified: (a) Enabling Factors to Workplace Integration: motivated nursing team, structured orientation program, support by a preceptor, additional practical skills and specific language training and (b) Barriers to Workplace Integration: lack of language proficiency, cultural differences, othering and racism/discrimination. The findings of the study suggest that working in a diverse workplace can be challenging, it is therefore important for successful integration to recognise not only the experiences of IQN but also the perceptions of nurses who work with internationally qualified peers.

Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane-containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C-H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late-stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.

One of the comorbid symptoms of individuals with ASD is sleep disturbance. There are two major hypotheses regarding the neural mechanism underlying ASD, i.e., the excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalance and the altered neuroplasticity hypotheses. However, the pathology of ASD remains unclear due to inconsistent research results. This paper argues that sleep is a confounding factor, thus, must be considered when examining the pathology of ASD because sleep plays an important role in modulating the E/I balance and neuroplasticity in the human brain. Investigation of the E/I balance and neuroplasticity during sleep might enhance our understanding of the neural mechanisms of ASD. It may also lead to the development of neurobiologically informed interventions to supplement existing psychosocial therapies.

What the paper adds to existing knowledge? circle This systematic scoping review brings together all research evidence since 2008 that reported how effective safety planning is for children/young people. circle Findings highlight that when healthcare professionals help children/young people who are suicidal, they need to ensure that the safety plan is completed collaboratively with healthcare professionals and children/young people and that it is appropriate for their age and development. circle There is also need for healthcare professionals to better recognize and respond to the needs of parents/carers who are caring for a child/young person with suicidal ideations/behaviours. What are the implications for practice? circle There is some research indicating that safety planning is effective for use with children/young people, but such evidence has primarily been obtained from females and there is need for more evidence from male study populations. Further research on its use is needed for certain groups of children/young people including those who are care experienced, or identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. circle This review highlighted that healthcare professionals need specific training before they deliver safety planning for children/young people. circle It was identified that parents/carers have additional needs and should be involved in safety planning. An additional resource specifically for parents/carers should be developed. Introduction: Suicide is a leading cause of death for children and young people and its prevention is a global priority. Many Mental Health Services employ safety planning as a brief intervention. There is some evidence of safety planning effectiveness for adults, but little is known about its effectiveness with young people. Aim: To synthesize research reporting safety planning effectiveness for children/ young people with suicidal ideation and identify good practice recommendations. Inclusion criteria: The review relates to safety planning around suicide prevention for children/young people aged less than 18 years, even if it was within a wider intervention. The review was inclusive of all clinical areas (including mental health, primary care, etc), any geographical location or social economic status and inclusivity around the method of delivery. Methods: A systematic scoping review of literature reporting effectiveness data for the use of safety planning with children/young people with suicidal ideation. The systematic scoping review protocol (pre-registered with Open Science Framework) followed Joanna Briggs Institute conduct guidance and PRISMA-ScR checklist. Data analysis and presentation: Fifteen studies were reported during 2008-2021. Overall, there is promising, but limited, evidence of effectiveness for safety planning for children/young people but with complete evidence gaps for some demographic sub-groups. Evidence determined that healthcare professionals should deliver a safety planning intervention that is completed collaboratively, developmentally appropriate, and recognizes parental/carer involvement. Discussion and implications for practice: Further research is needed but current evidence suggests safety planning should be a routine part of care packages for children/ young people with suicidal ideation proportionate to their needs. Developing/implementing these plans needs bespoke health professional training and additional support and resources for parents/carers should be developed.

Here, this problem is addressed using cross-domain object detection in style-images, clipart, watercolor, and comic images. In particular, a cross-domain object detection model is proposed using YoloV5 and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting). As detecting difficult instances in cross domain images is a challenging task, XGBoosting is incorporated in this workflow to enhance learning of the proposed model for application on hard-to-detect samples. Several ablation studies are carried out by training and evaluating this model on the StyleObject7K, ClipArt1K, Watercolor2K, and Comic2K datasets.

As controls, 12 IBD colectomy specimens with well- to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma that lacked any mucinous, signet ring cell, low-grade tubuloglandular or serrated features were also analysed. Compared with MACs and controls, LGTGAs more often had a flat/invisible macroscopic appearance (LGTGAs = 88%, MACs = 34%, controls = 25%, P < 0.001). MACs were more likely to have high-grade differentiation (MACs = 31%, LGTGAs = 0%, controls = 0%, P = 0.002) and a higher pathological stage (pT3 and pT4 MACs = 76%, LGTGAs = 35%, controls = 33%, P = 0.007) than LGTGAs and controls. LGTGAs (70%) and MACs (53%) were more frequently associated with non-conventional dysplasia than controls (0%) (P < 0.001). Crypt cell (40%) and hypermucinous (34%) dysplasias were the most common non-conventional subtypes associated with LGTGAs and MACs, respectively. Synchronous dysplasia often demonstrated non-conventional features in the LGTGA (33%) and MAC (47%) groups (versus 0% for the control group, P = 0.074). Synchronous cancer frequently showed similar histological features as the main tumour (LGTGA group = 60%, MAC group = 38%, control group = 100%).Conclusions Crypt cell and hypermucinous dysplasias are the most common precursor lesions associated with LGTGAs and MACs, respectively, and may serve as a marker of increased risk for these cancer subtypes.

Edge proximity conditions for extendability in regular bipartite graphs	JOURNAL OF GRAPH THEORY			English	Article; Early Access						distance restricted matching extension; forbidden configuration; matching extension		Let m and r be positive integers with r >= 3, let G be an r-regular cyclically ((m - 1) r + 1)-edge-connected bipartite graph and let M be a matching of size m in G. Plummer showed that whenever r >= m + 1, there is a perfect matching of G containing M. When r = 3, Aldred and Jackson, extended this result to the case when m + 1 >= r = 3 by showing there is a perfect matching in G containing M whenever the edges in M are pairwise at least distance f (m) apart where f(m) = { 1, m = 2, 3, 3 <= m <= 4, 4, 5 <= m <= 8 5, m >= 9. In this paper, we relax the condition that r = 3 and the distance restriction introduced by Aldred and Jackson to show that, for m >= r >= 3 and G an r-regular cyclically ((m - 1)r + 1)-edge-connected bipartite graph, for each matching M in G with |M| = m and such that each pair of edges in M is distance at least 3 apart, there is a perfect matching in G containing M.

Various research works are ongoing to evaluate the machinability of plant-based natural fiber composites. In the current investigation, an attempt has been made to fabricate and examine the drilling behavior of Typha angustifolia fiber reinforced (TAFR) composite. Composites were manufactured using Typha angustifolia fibers in unidirectional (UD) and bidirectional (BD) orientations using the epoxy matrix through the compression molding technique. Fibers were characterized using the X-ray diffraction method to determine the crystallinity index and crystallite size. Drilling experiments were conducted on TAFR composites and using Taguchi's L18 mixed-level design with various process parameters the experiments were conducted. The optimal experimental combination rendering the lowest value of exit delamination and thrust force was determined using Taguchi-TOPSIS hybrid approach. A quadratic model was also developed to predict the response of drilling. Drilled hole morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy to know about various failure mechanisms and damages induced during the drilling operations. It was found from the results that the lowest speed and feed rate and higher drill diameter rendered minimal delamination and thrust force for both UD and BD TAFR composites.

Several articles in the special issue describe how event-related potentials (ERPs) have been used to examine processing of faces that vary according to race, some of which have concluded that larger ERP amplitudes elicited by other-race (relative to own-race) faces indicates less efficient visual processing of other-race faces. I describe findings from ERP studies of race categorization that suggest an alternative interpretation-that other-race faces elicit stronger categorization, which impedes individuation of other-race faces.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood donation and transfusions in the United States in 2020	TRANSFUSION			English	Article						blood center operations; platelet transfusion; RBC transfusion	CONVALESCENT PLASMA	Introduction: Reports have suggested the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in blood donation shortages and adverse impacts on the blood supply. Using data from the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS), we quantified the pandemic's impact on red blood cell (RBC) and apheresis platelet collections and transfusions in the United States during year 2020.Methods: The 2021 NBCUS survey instrument was modified to include certain blood collection and utilization variables for 2020. The survey was distributed to all US blood collection centers, all US hospitals performing =1000 surgeries annually, and a 40% random sample of hospitals performing 100-999 surgeries annually. Weighting and imputation were used to generate national estimates for whole blood and apheresis platelet donation; RBC and platelet transfusion; and convalescent plasma distribution.Results: Whole blood collections were stable from 2019 (9,790,000?units; 95% CI: 9,320,000-10,261,000) to 2020 (9,738,000?units; 95% CI: 9,365,000-10,110,000). RBC transfusions decreased by 6.0%, from 10,852,000?units (95% CI: 10,444,000-11,259,000) in 2019 to 10,202,000?units (95% CI: 9,811,000-10,593,000) in 2020. Declines were steepest during March-April 2020, with transfusions subsequently rebounding. Apheresis platelet collections increased from 2,359,000?units (95% CI: 2,240,000-2,477,000) in 2019 to 2,408,000?units (95% CI: 2,288,000-2,528,000) in 2020. Apheresis platelet transfusions increased from 1,996,000?units (95% CI: 1,846,000-2,147,000) in 2019 to 2,057,000?units (95% CI: 1,902,000-2,211,000) in 2020.Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced blood donations and transfusions in some months during 2020 but only a minimal annualized decline compared with 2019.

Various adsorbent samples are prepared with different weight ratios of chitosan to nTiO(2). The adsorption capacity of the prepared adsorbents towards Cu(II) in an aqueous solution is also tested. The adsorption experiment is performed in batch mode under varying experimental conditions. Several isotherm and kinetic models are analyzed with the experimental data, and thermodynamic conditions required for adsorption are also determined. The highest elimination of Cu(II) was 39.19% with the adsorbent chitosan without nTiO(2) (CWT) with 20 mg L-1 initial Cu (II) concentration at adsorbent dosage 3 gL(-1) and 98.5% with the adsorbent CTNC1-1 (chitosan/nTiO(2) nanocomposite with the mass proportions of chitosan:nTiO(2) = 1:1) and 93% with CTNC2-1 (chitosan/nTiO(2) nanocomposite with the mass proportions of chitosan:nTiO(2) = 2:1) with 10 mg L-1 initial Cu(II) concentration at adsorbent dosage 5 g L-1. The isotherm model confirmed the monolayer adsorption. Maximum Langmuir adsorption capacities (q(L)) of the adsorbents for Cu(II) were given as CTNC1-1 > CTNC2-1 > CWT. The pseudo-second-order model excellently depicted the kinetic process with good correlation for all adsorbents. The statistical (R-square is more than 0.99) and genetic algorithm (GA) model (R-square is more than 0.99) effectively predicted the percentage removal of Cu(II).

For the lethality study, the LD50 was determined for each insecticide alone and in binary mixture by topical application. The combination index (CI) was established to quantify interactions occurring between the insecticides. The repellent effect was tested using the area preference technique. The lethal effect of amitraz was 11 and 34 times more potent than that of thymol and eugenol, respectively. Only the combination of eugenol and amitraz at high concentrations showed a synergistic effect (CI: 0.3). The repellent activity of monoterpenes after 30 min of exposure was significant at 780 and 78 mu g/cm(2) for eugenol and thymol, respectively. The residual repellent effect of eugenol lasted for one week at the concentrations of 1170 and 1560 mu g/cm(2), whereas thymol managed to retain its repellent effect for two weeks at concentrations of 1560 and 3900 mu g/cm(2).

Prevalence rates of NSSI, and self-directed violence more broadly, are elevated among military veterans. Despite the inclusion of interpersonal difficulty in the diagnostic criteria for NSSI disorder, the relationship between interpersonal risk factors and NSSI is not well-characterized, especially among veterans. This ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study investigated the hypothesis that interpersonal stressors and associated distress would precede and predict NSSI urge and engagement-but not vice versa-via cross-lagged multilevel modeling.Method: Forty veterans with NSSI disorder completed a 28-day EMA protocol with three daily prompts assessing NSSI urges, NSSI engagement, the occurrence of interpersonal stressors, and associated subjective interpersonal distress.Results: Interpersonal stressors preceded and predicted subsequent NSSI urges, but not NSSI engagement, whereas subjective interpersonal distress preceded and predicted both NSSI urges and NSSI engagement.Conclusion: Results identified interpersonal stressors as a risk factor for NSSI urges, and interpersonal distress as a risk factor for both NSSI urges and NSSI engagement. Findings highlight the importance of temporally assessing interpersonal factors related to NSSI and suggest that interpersonal distress may be a modifiable risk factor for NSSI.

J	Hastie, D				Hastie, David			Return of the Whig: Reviewing Historiographies of the Meaning of "Secular" in the Australian Colonial Public Instruction Acts	JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY			English	Article								The term "secular" in the Colonial Australian public instruction acts was always controversial. Recent policy debates seek to draw a connection between its original intent and removing religion from schools, notably Marion Maddox's Taking God to School (2014), and Catherine Byrne's "Free, Compulsory and (Not) Secular" (2013). The issue resurfaced recently in a NSW Teachers' Federation Research Paper (Waight, 2022), and in Gross and Rutland's Special Religious Education in Australia and Its Value to Contemporary Society (2021). I propose that while this is a valid public policy issue, any originalist argument actually relies upon a singular historiographical argument, namely a "Whig" historiography. However, across historians the meaning of "secular" has actually been evaluated through four different historiographies: a "Whig" progress narrative; economic materialism; critical theory; and a religious/nationalist approach. Maddox, Byrne and Waight's approaches can be characterised within a "Whig" approach to Australian education history, originally found in "The Melbourne School" of Austin and Gregory, and the textbooks of Barcan. Its revival presents a good opportunity to survey the topic of education historiography, assess the "Whig" argument, and to propose that religious/nationalist historiography provides a more accurate interpretation of the original intent of the term "secular."

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the earlier studies that investigated integrating AR and VR "wearables" into teaching and learning English based on the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model compared the differences in learning motivation and performance between traditional teaching methods and those using AR- and VR-based using wearables.Objectives: To create a thematic learning environment based on learners' lived experiences and provide them with an immersive English course that extends textbook knowledge using a technology-assisted real-life learning context.Method: This study used a quasi-experimental research design. A total of 119 participants were spilt into three learning groups based on teaching tools: traditional methods and AR- and VR-based wearable devices. The performance of each group was evaluated through three stages using appropriate educational tools for traditional, AR-, and VR-based classrooms, followed by semistructured interviews. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to investigate the inference learning performance (remembering and analysing) of the four ARCS dimensions with the three teaching methods.Results: The results showed that confidence and relevance were positively correlated with learning performance in the VR-based wearable group. In the context of the ARCS model, learners' confidence predicted learning performance and the remembering subdimension when VR-based learning materials were used.Implications: These results suggest that, compared to traditional teaching methods, VR-based wearables make it easier to create a highly immersive learning environment and are more likely to help learners find the correct words, improve their accuracy, and increase their confidence and sense of accomplishment in the entire learning process.

Changes in endogenous abscisic acid and stomata of the resurrection fern, <i>Pleopeltis polypodioides,</i> in response to de- and rehydration	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						abscisic acid; calcium; drought stress; hydrogen peroxide; nitric oxide; Pleopeltis polypodioides; stomata	ADIANTUM-CAPILLUS-VENERIS; BLUE-LIGHT RESPONSE; NITRIC-OXIDE; DESICCATION TOLERANCE; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; MESOPHYLL-CELLS; GUARD-CELLS; LEAVES; ABA; CO2	Premise: While angiosperms respond uniformly to abscisic acid (ABA) by stomatal closure, the response of ferns to ABA is ambiguous. We evaluated the effect of endogenous ABA, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric oxide (NO), and Ca2+, low and high light intensities, and blue light (BL) on stomatal opening of Pleopeltis polypodioides.Methods: Endogenous ABA was quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; microscopy results and stomatal responses to light and chemical treatments were analyzed with Image J.Results: The ABA content increases during initial dehydration, peaks at 15 h and then decreases to one fourth of the ABA content of hydrated fronds. Following rehydration, ABA content increases within 24 h to the level of hydrated tissue. The stomatal aperture opens under BL and remains open even in the presence of ABA. Closure was strongly affected by BL, NO, and Ca2+, regardless of ABA, H2O2 effect was weak.Conclusions: The decrease in the ABA content during extended dehydration and insensitivity of the stomata to ABA suggests that the drought tolerance mechanism of Pleopeltis polypodioides is independent of ABA.

Herein, we have demonstrated the use of biodiesel as a partial substitute of composite wax of emulsion explosives (EE), and mainly focused on the effects of biodiesel content on the thermal safety and explosion characteristics of EE. Compared with the EE without biodiesel, the average particle size of the internal phase decreases by 45.66 %, and the activation energy of the thermal decomposition reaction increases by 44.90 % when the biodiesel substitution amount is 2 %. The detonation velocity and lead column compression ratio are 5185 m/s and 0.4219 respectively, which were almost consistent with the sample without biodiesel. It follows that biodiesel addition increased the thermal safety of emulsion explosive simultaneously guaranteed explosive performance. Consequently, biodiesel can be developed as a promising oil phase substitute for EE.

More and more family members are impacted by the imprisonment of a loved one. They face a variety of difficulties, such as social exclusion, mental health difficulties, stigma, and isolation. A systematic review and meta-ethnography were carried out using Noblit & Hare's seven-step approach to bring together the qualitative research in this area and support policy recommendations. Key databases were searched systematically and 12 studies, with varying aims, sample, and location, were included. The synthesis produced six core themes, reflecting the experiences of partners (mainly female): Role Transitions; Loss and Isolation; Shame and Secrecy; Encounters with the Prison Systems; Silver Linings; New Ways of Coping. The overarching narrative that integrates the findings suggests that the experience of having a partner in prison is a process of resocialisation. Partners not only conform to new circumstances and adjust their behaviour, but also adjust to changes in their roles and responsibilities, relationships, positions in society, and their futures. The findings, notwithstanding limitations and recommendations for future research, highlight the need for healthcare professionals, community and prison services, and policymakers to work together to support this population in their resocialisation process.

J	Mease, JJ; Neal, B				Mease, Jennifer J.; Neal, Bronwyn			Paradox as resistance in male dominated fields and the value of (sur)facing enthymematic narratives	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article						enthymeme; narrative; paradox; politics	PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY; GENDER; WOMEN; DISCOURSE; WORK	Women working in masculine organizational contexts face a challenge of balancing (1) access to power by co-opting masculine discourse in ways that risk reinforcing it, with (2) challenging and resisting practices that privilege masculinity. In this manuscript, we address one communication strategy for navigating that challenge: The denial/acknowledgment paradox in which women explicitly deny that gender affected their experience, but also describe the many ways it affected their experience. To do so, we examined transcripts of interviews with 11 women candidates who ran in the 2017 Virginia House of Delegates election in the United States and demonstrated this paradoxical communication strategy. Our analysis offers five different structures of the denial/acknowledgment paradox and shows how four of those structures engage what we call an "enthymematic narrative" of victimhood. Ultimately, we argue that (sur)facing the enthymematic narrative amplifies the generative potential of the denial/acknowledgment paradox and suggest that (sur)facing enthymematic narratives should be taken up more broadly as a strategy for organizational and social change.

Perspectives on relapse prevention following intensive treatment of anorexia nervosa: A focus group study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS			English	Article						anorexia nervosa; focus group; qualitative methods; relapse prevention; technology; telehealth	COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; EATING-DISORDERS; WEIGHT-GAIN; PATIENT; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY; ILLNESS; PEOPLE; ADOLESCENTS; TELEHEALTH	Objective: Including the perspectives of individuals with lived experience of mental health issues is a critical step in research and treatment development. Focus groups with patients with a history of treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) were conducted in anticipation of a clinical trial of Relapse Prevention and Changing Habits (REACH+). Methods: Seven female adults (23-51 years) who had previously received inpatient treatment for AN, now in remission, participated in one of two semistructured focus groups. Rapid qualitative analysis was used to examine participants' contributions and identify common topics. Results: Transcript analysis yielded three topics related to relapse prevention: (1) recovery aids, including a sense of agency in treatment decisions and finding new interests/passions, (2) recovery hindrances, such as lack of access to care, and (3) identification of members of support system. Aspects of REACH+ received positive feedback, such as continuity of care from the inpatient setting and the use of telehealth. Viewpoints differed with respect to the helpfulness of obtaining patient weights in treatment. The REACH+ online platform received positive comments regarding content and usability, as well as suggestions for additional content. Discussion: Qualitative feedback from patients with a history of AN highlighted the value of engaging patients in their own treatment decisions, as well as in treatment design and innovation. Within this small group, there were differences of opinion about treatment components, specifically weight assessment, that suggest the need for further data. User-centered design provides opportunities to improve the acceptability and, therefore, dissemination of novel treatments. Public Significance: Relapse prevention is a critical treatment need for patients with anorexia nervosa, as this illness too often follows a protracted course. There are challenges in both obtaining specialized care and in retaining patients in treatment. Here, patient perspectives on these challenges offer input to allow for optimization of relapse prevention treatment. Shared decision-making may be particularly valuable to support an individual's sense of agency and engagement in care.

Remarkably, magnon-magnon coupling is experimentally identified in Ni80Fe20 nanocross array with the number of spins reaching a very low value of approximate to 10(12). Moreover, the coupling strength is effectively tuned via different external parameters, viz. microwave excitation power and the bias-field orientation. Extensive simulations reveal that both the static and dynamical dipolar coupling contribute to the observed anticrossing phenomenon. Simultaneously, mode-softening of spin wave tunable by subtle changes of bias-field orientation is also observed. The findings can greatly enrich various hybrid phenomena with a magnonic platform.

Electrochemical Oxidation and Functionalization of Low-Density Polyethylene	CHEMELECTROCHEM			English	Article						Electrochemistry; Polyethylene; Electrochemical Polymer Functionalization; Polymer Upcycling; Oxidation	INTERMEDIATE; KINETICS	Plastic waste is a serious environmental issue, and polyethylene (PE) is a significant component. The chemically inert nature of PE makes its recycling/upcycling process challenging. Thus, a novel method was demonstrated that enables the selective electrochemical functionalization and deconstruction of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) by using low-cost transition metal electrocatalysts at room temperature (23 +/- 2 degrees C) and low cell voltage (+/- 1 V). Three different electrode and electrolyte combinations were studied for the oxidation of LDPE: copper metal/copper (II) ions, nickel metal/nickel (II) ions, and stainless steel/iron (II) and (III) ions. The copper and nickel electrode/electrolyte pairs showed a promising capability for oxidation and chain-scission of LDPE. In contrast, the stainless-steel and iron electrode/electrolyte pair showed no activity towards LDPE oxidation or depolymerization. The electrolysis of LDPE offers a new vista for the depolymerization and upcycling of plastics, further understanding of the process is needed.

J	Rimehaug, T				Rimehaug, Tormod			"Turning back the clock": A positive strategy for changing unacceptable youth behavior	FAMILY PROCESS			English	Article; Early Access							PARENTS; INTERVENTION; CHILDHOOD	This paper describes "Turning back the clock" (TBC)-an innovative strategy addressing unacceptable or coercive youth behavior based on nonviolent principles, inspired by the nonviolent resistance movement (NVR)-also called connecting authority or caring authority (CA) approaches to guidance and supervision of parents and other adults. Variants of NVR/CA have been evaluated as effective in RCT and pre-post designs. TBC has not been evaluated regarding its effectiveness but shows promising usability in case studies. The aim of this description of the TBC strategy is to encourage development and testing of its usability on large scale to improve it and pave the way for effectiveness evaluations. The core of TBC is to create possibilities for improving behavior without delay by negotiating the social timeline narrative. This allows improvement through reenactment of events immediately after having said or done something unfortunate or unacceptable instead of waiting for the next comparable situation. Adults introduce the strategy by modeling it before youths are encouraged to improve their own misbehavior immediately without waiting for a later opportunity. Finally, adults declare that a set of unacceptable behaviors will be considered disqualifying to any request or demand, but that attempting again as if it had not happened can be a possibility: Using the TBC strategy. This declaration is intended to increase youth's interest in using TBC themselves, and with successful use reduce escalation of conflicts into coercion and threats.

The transformation provides the most direct access to pharmaceutically relevant enantioenriched gamma-nitroesters, utilizing feedstock chemicals, with unprecedented selectivity. The methodology exhibits a broad substrate scope, including beta-(fluoro)alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl substituted electrophiles, and was successfully applied on a gram scale with reduced catalyst loading, and, additionally, catalyst recovery was carried out. The formal synthesis of a range of drug molecules, and an enantioselective synthesis of (S)-rolipram were achieved. Additionally, computational studies revealed key reaction intermediates and transition state structures, and provided rationale for high enantioselectivities, in good agreement with experimental results.

Main concept of the proposed converter is universal power conversion, and the same converter is used for DC-DC/DC-AC applications which also aiming for minimum redundancy because the proposed converter can be able to produce DC and AC output from the fixed/variable DC source. The proposed converter is designed with single-stage dual leg topology, with a designed filter, and protection circuits are connected in output/grid side. The proposed circuit is compared with existing topologies, and comparative analyses are made in both chopper (DC-DC) and inverter (DC-AC) modes for universal or generic operation. Real-time implementation of the proposed model is prepared for the power rating of 3.5 KW during inverter mode and 4 KW when same circuit working in chopper mode. Hardware results are obtained from the model from both chopper and inverter modes. Finally, correct applications, advantages, and future work are concluded in the last section.

Nanomaterials have attracted the scientific research for the past three decades and are widely explored for multifunctional applications. Research is ongoing to understand the properties of various emerging nanomaterials such as MXenes, MBenes, transition metal dichalcogenides, black phosphorous, and so forth to name a few. Among the various layered two-dimensional (2D) materials, transition metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides (collectively known as MXenes) have received profound interest due to their exciting physical and chemical properties. Among the MXene family, titanium-based MXenes have been explored the most. But the research on non-titanium-based MXenes are still in the developing stage. Zirconium (Zr)-based MXenes are the emerging materials having peculiar characteristics. Herein, we discuss the syntheses, properties, and application of Zr-based MXenes. Initially, the MAX phases of Zr-based MXenes are discussed. Further, the synthesis of Zr-based MXenes by various methods are included. Furthermore, the applications of Zr-based MXenes in rechargeable batteries such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, and so forth are reviewed.

As is demonstrated by our previous report, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) with hollow morphology is very beneficial to improve sensing performance. As expected, the PSP-CoFePBA hollow framework in this work exhibits far superior glucose sensing performance compared with classic CoFePBA nanoparticles and nanoboxes as well as most of reported PBA-based glucose sensors. Herein, very high sensitivity of 1184.18 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) and 267.63 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) in the concentration range of 5-325 mu M and 325-1025 mu M, respectively, as well as low detection limit of 0.4 mu M (S/N=3) and high stability can be observed. In a word, this work proposes and develops a simple and general synthetic strategy for constructing PBA-based hollow material, that will be very helpful in this field.

Among various contributing factors for maternal obesity-evoked health sequelae, developmental programming is considered as one of the leading culprit factors for maternal obesity-associated chronic comorbidities. Although a unified theory is still lacking to systematically address multiple unfavorable postnatal health sequelae, a cadre of etiological machineries have been put forward, including lipotoxicity, inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy/mitophagy defect, and cell death. Hereinto, autophagy and mitophagy play an essential housekeeping role in the clearance of long-lived, damaged, and unnecessary cell components to maintain and restore cellular homeostasis. Defective autophagy/mitophagy has been reported in maternal obesity and negatively impacts fetal development and postnatal health. This review will provide an update on metabolic disorders in fetal development and postnatal health issues evoked by maternal obesity and/or intrauterine overnutrition and discuss the possible contribution of autophagy/mitophagy in metabolic diseases. Moreover, relevant mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies will be discussed in an effort to target autophagy/mitophagy and metabolic disturbances in maternal obesity.

Materials and methods: Two typodont acrylic teeth models were prepared to receive fixed dental prostheses with three different span lengths. Span 1: between maxillary canines; span 2: between maxillary second premolars; and span 3: between maxillary second molars. In the first model, prepared teeth had a TOC of 12 degrees, whereas, in the second model, teeth had a TOC of 20 degrees. Each model was scanned 10 times using 4 different intraoral scanners (Omnicam, Primescan, Trios 4, and Medit i500). The STL files from the scans were compared to the reference models (trueness) and within each test group (precision) using a 3D comparison software. Data were then statistically analyzed. Results: Regarding trueness, no significant differences were found among Primescan (32.58 +/- 13.08), Trios 4 (32.33 +/- 12.19), and Medit i500 (32.26 +/- 9.57). However, all showed significantly better trueness than Omnicam (35.70 +/- 8.35) (p < 0.001). The highest values were found in scans between the second molars (47.42 +/- 3.94), followed by scans between second premolars (28.42 +/- 3.78), and the highest trueness was found in scans between the canines (23.80 +/- 3.85). For TOC, 12 degrees had a significantly higher value than 20 degrees (p < 0.001). Regarding precision, the highest values were found with Omnicam (29.84 +/- 3.89), followed by Medit i500 (28.04 +/- 2.94), then Trios 4 (25.64 +/- 3.11), and Primescan (24.69 +/- 5.25). The highest values and least precision were found in scans between the second molars (28.97 +/- 5.27) and scans between second premolars (27.59 +/- 3.97), whereas the highest precision was found in scans between the canines (24.60 +/- 2.04). For TOC, 12 degrees had significantly higher values than 20 degrees (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Intraoral scans are directly affected by scanner type, TOC, and scan spans. All tested scanners showed clinically acceptable results even for long-span restorations.

Given the reformation of non-fullerene acceptors, the certificated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs has developed rapidly over 19% in the small device size (<1 cm(2)). However, the PCEs of large-area OSCs are significantly lower than that of small-area devices. Several essential issues in upscaling OSCs from small-area to large-area need to be overcome to bridge the efficiency gap, including coating techniques, material requirements, morphology optimization, flexible transparent electrodes development, and devices stability research.

Previous studies have shown that ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) and EIN3-like (SlEIL) proteins mediate ethylene signaling and reduce plant tolerance to freezing in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying an EIN3/EILs-mediated photoprotection pathway under chilling stress are unclear. Here, we discovered that salicylic acid (SA) participates in photosystem II (PSII) protection via SlEIL2 and SlEIL7. Under chilling stress, the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene SlPAL5 plays an important role in the production of SA, which also induces WHIRLY1 (SlWHY1) transcription. The resulting accumulation of SlWHY1 activates SlEIL7 expression under chilling stress. SlEIL7 then binds to and blocks the repression domain of the heat shock factor SlHSFB-2B, releasing its inhibition of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 21 (HSP21) expression to maintain PSII stability. In addition, SlWHY1 indirectly represses SlEIL2 expression, allowing the expression of l-GALACTOSE-1-PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE3 (SlGPP3). The ensuing higher SlGPP3 abundance promotes the accumulation of ascorbic acid (AsA), which scavenges reactive oxygen species produced upon chilling stress and thus protects PSII. Our study demonstrates that SlEIL2 and SlEIL7 protect PSII under chilling stress via two different SA response mechanisms: one involving the antioxidant AsA and the other involving the photoprotective chaperone protein HSP21.

This presented literature is aiming at summarizing the regulatory function of epigenetics in physiological amelogenesis process and reviewing the epigenetic mechanisms in occurrence of developmental defects of enamel (DDE), so as to provide biological foundation evidence to support early predication and clinical management of DDE.Method: An extensive literature review was conducted using electronic databases MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science and EMBASE up to November 30, 2022. Studies about epigenetic effects on enamel tissue or cells associated with amelogenesis, including in vivo studies using human or animal models, and in vitro studies, are selected.Results: A total of 22 studies were included. Epigenetic factors or effects specifically activate or silence certain genes, which may regulate related biological activities including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, enamel secretion, and mineralization during the process of amelogenesis. Once the status of epigenetic modification is altered, the quantity and quality of enamel may both be disturbed, which can finally result in DDE.Conclusion: Epigenetics plays a noteworthy role of regulating the amelogenesis process and DDE potentially by altering the expression levels of genes related to enamel formation, providing a new perspective of early predication and clinical management of DDE.

Effects of turmeric extract supplementation on the lipid and lipoprotein subfraction profile in hemodialysis patients: A randomised, double-blind, crossover and controlled trial	PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						chronic kidney diseases; curcuma longa extract; curcumin; hemodialysis; lipid profile; lipid subfractions	CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; NANO-CURCUMIN; CHOLESTEROL; DYSLIPIDEMIA	Dyslipidemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease. Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol from Curcuma longa, can improve lipid profile. This study aims to analyze the effects of Curcuma Longa extract supplementation on lipid profile and lipoprotein subfractions in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This is a longitudinal, double-blind, washout-period randomized clinical trial. The patients were randomized into two groups: the curcumin group (n = 10) (orange and carrot juice with 2.5 g of Curcuma Longa extract) and the control group (n = 11) (juice without curcumin) 3x/w during HD sessions for 3 months. After the washout period, patients continued the supplementation as a crossover for the same period. The lipid profile was measured using enzymatic assays. The high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein subfractions analyses were performed using LipoprintTM. In the curcumin group, the triglyceride values tended to decrease with a different triglyceride variation between the pre and post-intervention for the control and curcumin groups of 38.5 (19.8) mg/dL (p = 0.06). There was no statistical difference in the others parameters. In conclusion, Curcuma longa extract may be a good nutritional strategy to reduce triglyceride plasma levels in hemodialysis patients, but it seems ineffective for the other parameter.

Of much interest, the calculation results are well consistent with the available experimental results. With a strong dependence on the interphase strength, the toughening mechanisms during crack propagation are well presented, for example, fiber pull-out, crack deflection, and interphase debonding. Furthermore, the longitudinal tensile strength of SiCf/SiC composites increases with decreasing the interphase strength, where only a weak enough interphase can result in a significant crack deflection by its cracking. In particular, the ratio of the interphase strength along fibers to the matrix strength should be less than 1.254 to ensure crack deflection in the interphase and fiber pull-out. Moreover, the transverse tensile strength of SiCf/SiC composites reaches a maximum with increasing the interphase thickness into the range of 0.25-0.5 mu m.

Although organizations are aware of its potential benefits, they face some challenges while creating a clear road map to adopt this approach. Capability maturity models are developed to guide organizations by providing an extensive road map for improvement. Accordingly, we developed a capability maturity model, entitled SPL Capability Maturity Model (SPL-CMM), to improve an organization's SPL capabilities by enabling the assessment of SPL-specific processes and providing a guideline for process improvement. SPL-CMM, developed based on SPICE-ISO/IEC 330xx standard, has two dimensions of process and capability. The process dimension consists of 16 SPL-specific processes defined under four process areas: business, architecture, technical, and organization, and the capability dimension has six capability and maturity levels from levels 0 to 5. It is a structured approach assisted by adequate measures with guidance on actions for improvement. A case study was conducted to check the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach in a software company. The case study results show that SPL-CMM is applicable for identifying the current state of the SPL process capability and the gaps for process improvement to the next level.

But this criticism has occurred in the absence of comprehensive, multi-year data on how computer crimes are actually sentenced and how those sentences compare to other, purportedly similar crimes, such as trespass, burglary, or fraud. This article uses an analysis of real-world sentencing data to examine how the computer crimes are actually sentenced. We combined court filings and U.S. Sentencing Commission data files to build a custom data set of 1095 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) sentences from 2005 through 1998. Our results show that CFAA sentences are sentenced differently from trespass, burglary, or non-CFAA fraud crimes; that sentences in which the defendant exceeded authorized access have declined over the years; and that the "sophisticated means" and "special skills" enhancements have been less routinely applied than has been assumed. These results have policy implications for how CFAA crimes are sentenced.

RESULTS: In our field trials we found that weekly applications of a push-pull strategy can reduce stable fly populations on cattle as well as a standard insecticide (permethrin). We also found that the efficacy periods of the push-pull and permethrin treatments following on-animal application were equivalent. Traps with an attractant lure used as the pull component of the push-pull strategy captured sufficient numbers of stable flies to reduce on-animal numbers by an estimated 17-21%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first proof-of-concept field trial demonstrating the effectiveness of a push-pull strategy using a coconut oil fatty acid-based repellent formulation and traps with an attractant lure to manage stable flies on pasture cattle. Also notable is that the push-pull strategy had an efficacy period equivalent to that of a standard, conventional insecticide under field conditions. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Mosaic Cu<SUP>I</SUP>-Cu<SUP>II</SUP>-In<SUP>III</SUP> 2D Perovskites: Pressure-Dependence of the Intervalence Charge Transfer and a Mechanochemical Alloying Method	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article						2D Perovskite; Conductivity; High Pressure; Intervalence Charge Transfer; Mechanochemical Synthesis	MIXED-VALENCE COMPOUND; HALIDE; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; CHALLENGES; DESIGN	The perovskite (BA)(4)[Cu-II(Cu(II)n(III))(0.5)]Cl-8 (1BA; BA(+) = butylammonium) allows us to study the high-pressure structural, optical, and transport properties of a mixed-valence 2D perovskite. Compressing 1(BA) reduces the onset energy of Cu-I/II intervalence charge transfer from 1.2 eV at ambient pressure to 0.2 eV at 21 GPa. The electronic conductivity of 1(BA) increases by 4 orders of magnitude upon compression to 20 GPa, when the activation energy for conduction decreases to 0.16 eV. In contrast, Cu-II perovskites achieve similar conductivity at approximate to 50 GPa. The solution-state synthesis of these perovskites is complicated, with more undesirable side products likely from the precursor mixtures containing three different metal ions. To circumvent this problem, we demonstrate an efficient mechanochemical synthesis to expand this family of halide perovskites with complex composition by simply pulverizing together powders of 2D Cu-II single perovskites and (CuInIII)-In-I double perovskites.

Herein, phytate-coordinated Ni foam (PA-NF) is reported as an efficient pAOR electrocatalyst with a benzylamine oxidation rate of 1.01 mmol h(-1) and a benzonitrile selectivity of similar to 100 %. Experimental evidence indicated the upshift of the d-band center of the Ni sites after PA coordination and enhancement of the adsorption kinetics of oxygen intermediates on the PA-NF surface during the reaction, resulting in high catalytic performance. This work details a facile strategy for enhancing the pAOR performance of Ni- and other transition-metal-based electrocatalysts.

Whether anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy can modify RNP progression is unclear. This investigation quantified the impact of anti-VEGF therapy on RNP progression compared with laser or sham at 12 months. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were performed; Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched from inception to 4th March 2022. The change in any continuous measure of RNP at 12 months and 24 months was the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Outcomes were reported utilising standardised mean differences (SMD). The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version-2 and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines informed risk of bias and certainty of evidence assessments. Results: Six RCTs (1296 eyes) and three RCTs (1131 eyes) were included at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Meta-analysis demonstrated that RNP progression may be slowed with anti-VEGF therapy compared with laser/sham at 12 months (SMD: -0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.29, -0.06; p = 0.003; I-2 = 0; GRADE rating: LOW) and 24-months (SMD: -0.21; 95% CI: -0.37, -0.05; p = 0.009; I-2 = 28%; GRADE rating: LOW). The certainty of evidence was downgraded due to indirectness and due to imprecision. Conclusion: Anti-VEGF treatment may slightly impact the pathophysiologic process of progressive RNP in DR. The dosing regimen and the absence of diabetic macular edema may impact this potential effect. Future trials are needed to increase the precision of the effect and inform the association between RNP progression and clinically important events.

In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin-1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin-coated vesicles formation. Its N-terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature-inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i) enhancing membrane interactions, (ii) helix structuring, (iii) inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv) loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was obtained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa-arginine cell-penetrating peptides into living cells.

Methods: A sample of 232 outpatients with PD was assessed with the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) for functional impairments. Separation anxiety was evaluated using structured interviews and questionnaires. We applied a K-Means Cluster Analysis based on the standardized "PD age of onset" and "the PDSS total score" to identify distinct but homogeneous groups. Results: We identified three groups of patients: group 1 ("PD early onset/severe", N = 97, 42%, onset 23.2 +/- 6.7 years), group 2 ("PD early onset/not severe", N = 76, 33%, onset 23.4 +/- 6.0 years) and group 3 ("PD adult onset/not severe", N = 59, 25%, onset 42.8 +/- 7.0 years). Patients with early onset/severe PD had significantly higher scores on all SA measures than PD late-onset/not severe. Regression analyses showed that SA scores, but not PDSS scores, were predictive of impairment in SDS work/school, social life, and family functioning domains. Conclusions: Our data indicate a significant relationship between SA and PD with an earlier age of onset and an impact on individual functioning.

Many polymeric membranes have been reported in the past for the separation of gases specially to remove CO2 from natural gas and low-pressure flue-gas streams. The performance of membranes can be tailored by dispersing nanofillers in a polymeric matrix to produce mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). This not only adds mechanical strength to membranes but also reduces compaction of the polymeric layer at high pressure and maintains high performance. Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) gained attention in gas separation technology and due to their tubular structure have been used in a variety of applications in biomedical, coating, composite, and electronic industries. However, very little but conclusive literature and reviews are available to indicate that functionalized and non-functionalized HNTs can improve the performance of MMMs for efficient CO2 capture. The current status and gaps for potential applications of HNTs-based membranes for gas separation are identified and reviewed.

However, fiber production in the Lyocell process requires a high recyclability of the solvent. Some compounds from the class of ionic liquids (IL) may have higher dissolving capacities together with a higher thermal stability than the conventional N-methylmorpholin-N-oxide (NMMO), which makes them more valuable in an industrial process. A promising representative of such an advanced solvent for Lyocell process, 7-Methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene acetate ([MTBDH][AcO]) was investigated in this study. A series of 21 consecutive cellulose dissolving and spinning trials via dry-jet wet spinning was conducted with the same batch of solvent. In the spinning trials, the cellulose was regenerated into water consisting spinning bath. The solvent was recycled by removing the water from the spin bath via distillation in reduced pressure. Due these drastic changes in the water content of the IL during the whole process, the hydrolytic stability is an important aspect to assess the recyclability of the IL and viability of the whole process. The chemical composition of the IL was monitored by means of NMR spectroscopy. Although there was an increase of hydrolysis level of the solvent, cellulose could be dissolved constantly and spun to obtain staple fibers. The spinning behavior deteriorated slowly along the additional cycles, along with a measured increase in zero-shear viscosity of the spinning dope. Nevertheless, the physical properties of the obtained fibers were barely influenced by the changes of the ionic liquid.

We hypothesized that histologic evidence of compression would be identified at sites where the upper trunk was impacted by the anterior scalene muscle and the lower trunk by anatomic anomalies or the first rib. The purpose of this study was to investigate this hypothesis in human cadavers. Materials and Methods: Twenty-five cadavers' brachial plexuses were dissected and excised. Histologic and descriptive analysis was directed at juncture 1, the upper trunk and anterior scalene muscle, and juncture 2, C8 and T1 nerve roots (lower trunk) with the posterior border of the first rib. Measurements were obtained at the juncture of the T1 nerve root with the C8 nerve root in relationship to the first rib. Results: Histologic analysis demonstrated epineurial and perineurial fibrosis, myelin thinning, and Renaut bodies at junctures 1 and 2. Lower trunk formation occurred on or lateral to the first rib in 66% of specimens, with asymmetry in 32% of cadavers. A muscle of Albinus was present in 18% of cadavers. A large dorsal scapular artery coursed through 36% of plexuses with a high, arched subclavian artery. Conclusions: We report histologic changes consistent with chronic compression of the upper and lower plexus in the thoracic inlet at hypothesized sites of brachial plexus compression that may correlate with clinical neck/shoulder (upper trunk) and "ulnar nerve-like" (C8-T1/lower trunk) symptoms. Anatomic anomalies identified should alert the surgeon to variations of lower trunk formation at compression sites.	[Tiongco, Rafael Felix P.; Dellon, A.

While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated a-amino acids (a-AAs) as bridges to construct side chain-stapled analogs of an interleukin-17A-binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA-derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D-amino acid bridges, the L-AA-based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the interleukin-17A(IL-17A)-binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL-17A-inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.

This study contributes to improving the sustainability of mining throughout the mine's lifecycle until the final destination of the mining products. We propose recommendations that address the sustainability of mining from a global perspective, framed around the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), following waste hierarchy with Common Agricultural Policies, and policies from the Green Deal on climate, energy, transport, and taxation. Tailings are the most significant source of environmental impact in mining operations and, therefore, must comply with controlling regulations through Tailings Management Facilities (TMFs). However, there have been several mining accidents involving TMFs worldwide. The recommendations begin during planning, preconstruction, and construction with practices such as fair consultations, tax revenue fairness, and mandatory insurance. The operation and management support parallel industries to mining and supporting health and education. Emergency planning involves the surrounding communities in mock drills and environmental monitoring. In the closure and rehabilitation, remediation technologies such as phytoremediation, carbon sequestration incentives, and biomass valorization are recommended. Finally, supporting a circular economy by prioritizing ethical consumption, resource reduction, material recovery, and replacing toxic minerals and materials from the start with "benign by design" is recommended. The strategies involve stakeholders directly or indirectly related to the mining companies' contamination and demonstrate a commitment to the SDGs, offering a holistic perspective on scientific, social, and regulatory issues.

Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with the cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From the viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction systems to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio-detection applications.

Here, we develop the high-performance FSCs based on multiscale dot-wire-sheet heterostructure microfiber of nitrogen-doped carbon dots-Ti3C2Tx/silk nanofibers (NCDs-Ti3C2Tx/SNFs) hybrids via microfluidic fabrication. Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing, plentiful porous channels, accelerated H+ ion transport dynamics, large electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength/flexibility, the NCDs-Ti3C2Tx/SNFs possesses high volumetric capacitance (2218.7 F cm(-3)) and reversible charge-discharge stability in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the solid-state FSCs present high energy density (57.9 mWh cm(-3)), good capacitance (1157 F cm(-3)), long-life cycles (82.3 % capacitance retention after 40000 cycles), which realize the actual energy-supply applications (powering lamp, watch and toy car).

Exploring the acquaintanceship effect for the accuracy of judgments of traits and profiles of adult playfulness	JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY			English	Article; Early Access						adult playfulness; interpersonal perception; OLIW; personality judgments; self-other agreement	SELF-OTHER AGREEMENT; PERSONALITY JUDGMENTS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SIGNAL THEORY; CONSENSUS; SIMILARITY; VALIDITY; MODEL; PLAY; IMPRESSIONS	Objective: We aimed to extend the research on the interpersonal perception of adult playfulness (global and facets: Other-directed, Lighthearted, Intellectual, and Whimsical [OLIW]) by testing whether judgmental accuracy relates to indicators of acquaintanceship.Background: Playfulness has been found to contribute to social relationships.Method: Using data from 658 dyads (1,318 participants) who had been acquainted for 1 month to 62.2 years, we computed measurement invariance analyses and self-other agreement (SOA) for the facets and profiles of playfulness. We operationalized acquaintanceship as length of acquaintanceship, relationship type (friends, family, and partners), and intensity of acquaintanceship. We tested acquaintanceship effects with multigroup latent analyses and response surface analyses.Results: Self- and other ratings of playfulness showed scalar measurement invariance and robust SOA in traits and distinctive profiles (= .37). There was only minor evidence for acquaintanceship effects for relationship duration (only Intellectual playfulness), and group comparisons showed that friends yielded lower SOA in profiles than dyads of family members and couples.Conclusion: Considering that playfulness can be accurately perceived even at zero acquaintance, we discuss whether playfulness is a "good trait" (high trait visibility) in which acquaintanceship plays a minor role. We also discuss methodological considerations for detecting acquaintanceship effects during relationship formation.

Investigating interindividual variability in corticomotor reorganization during sustained hamstring pain: A randomized experimental study	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article; Early Access						Hamstring; TMS; Pain; Corticomotor	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL SCALE; USE-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; ONSET MUSCLE SORENESS; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL PLASTICITY; INJURIES; EXERCISE; BRAIN	BackgroundIncreasing evidence suggests that pain drives maladaptive corticomotor changes that may increase susceptibility to injury and promote symptom recurrence. However, few studies have evaluated the influence of interindividual corticomotor responses to musculoskeletal pain. Existing research in this area has also been limited largely to the upper limb. This is a pertinent point, given the functional and neurophysiological differences between upper and lower limb muscles, as well as the fact that most acute sporting injuries occur in the lower limb. Accordingly, this study explored the variability of corticomotor responses to experimentally-induced sustained hamstring pain and whether specific patterns of corticomotor reorganization were associated with poorer outcomes (mechanical sensitivity, pain, or functional limitation). MethodThirty-six healthy individuals participated. Following random allocation on Day 0, the experimental group performed an eccentric exercise protocol of the right hamstring muscles to induce delayed onset muscle soreness. The control group performed repetition-matched concentric exercise that did not induce soreness. Measures of mechanical sensitivity, pain, function, and corticomotor organization were collected at baseline and on Day 2. Results and conclusionsCorticomotor responses to sustained hamstring pain were variable. Individuals who developed corticomotor facilitation in response to hamstring pain experienced greater mechanical sensitivity than those who developed corticomotor depression. These novel data could have implications for rehabilitation following lower limb pain or injury.

Eucalyptus smithii has recently emerged as a promising species for cellulose pulp production. However, an average of 40% of young trees die during the first and second summer of post-planting. In this study, 32 Phytophthora isolates were obtained from 132 E. smithii young trees with root and collar rot symptoms, confirming the association of Phytophthora to E. smithii decline. Based on phylogenetic analysis of ITS, TUB2, cox1 and HSP90 gene regions and phenotypical characteristics, two species belonging to the genera Phytophthora clade 4 were identified, P. alticola (96%) and P. boodjera (4%). Tested isolates of both species significantly reduced both shoot and root dry weights of inoculated E. smithii seedlings compared to control plants. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that P. alticola and P. boodjera are recovered from young symptomatic E. smithii trees in commercial plantations as well as the first time these species are found in the Americas.

Minimal motor impairment was assessed simultaneously. The time course of seizure protec-tion in rats was compared with the concentration profiles of d-fenfluramine, l- fenfluramine, and their primary active metabolites in plasma and brain.Results: All compounds tested were active against MES-induced seizures in rats and mice after acute (single- dose) administration, but no activity against 6 -Hz seizures was found even at doses up to 30 mg/kg. Estimates of median effec-tive doses (ED50) in the rat -MES test were obtained for all compounds except for d- norfenfluramine, which caused dose-limiting neurotoxicity. Racemic fen-fluramine had approximately the same antiseizure potency as its individual enan-tiomers. Both d-and l- fenfluramine were absorbed and distributed rapidly to the brain, suggesting that seizure protection at early time points (=2 h) was related mainly to the parent compound. Concentrations of all enantiomers in brain tis-sue were >15- fold higher than those in plasma.Significance: Although there are differences in antiseizure activity and phar-macokinetics among the enantiomers of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine, all compounds tested are effective in protecting against MES-induced seizures in rodents. In light of the evidence linking the d- enantiomers to cardiovascu-lar and metabolic adverse effects, these data suggest that l-fenfluramine and l- norfenfluramine are potentially attractive candidates for a chiral switch approach leading to development of a novel, enantiomerically- pure antiseizure medication.

J	Hansson, K; Ganetz, H; Sveningsson, M				Hansson, Karin; Ganetz, Hillevi; Sveningsson, Malin			The significance of feminist infrastructure: #MeToo in the construction industry and the green industry in Sweden	GENDER WORK AND ORGANIZATION			English	Article; Early Access						#MeToo; affective dissonance; digital activism; feminist infrastructure; shared differences	GENDER; INTERSECTIONALITY; MASCULINITY; WOMEN	To better understand the interplay between digital activism and feminist infrastructure, this study investigates #MeToo activism in the Swedish construction industry and green industry. Both are industries in transition characterized by a dissonance between formal incentives, that encourage women and others to work in environments previously dominated by white men, and the informal power structures hosting a toxic masculinity. Based on media texts and interviews with key persons from the industries, the article situates #MeToo in a local context and shows how it was embedded in a supportive social, cultural, and technical infrastructure. In both industries, at the time of #MeToo this feminist infrastructure was already in place consisting of: an awareness of the problem of sexual harassment and abuse, knowledge of feminist explanatory models, established feminist online networks, and a supportive feminist culture, which together with widespread digital and feminist literacy became instrumental in the organization of the movement. Social media connected activists and created a critical mass by supporting the uniting of conflicting identity positions around shared differences. The established feminist infrastructure meant that the #MeToo activism, by articulating a widespread affective dissonance, pushed open doors that were already half open and forced them wide. This can explain some of the movement's success in Sweden.

Guidelines recommend the use of clinical decision tools to increase efficiency and avoid harms from overtesting, including D-dimer screening in patients not at high risk for PE. Women undergo testing for PE more often than men yet have a lower yield from testing. Our study objective was to determine whether patient sex influenced the odds of received guideline-consistent care.MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study at two large U.S. academic EDs from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. Nonpregnant patients aged 18-49 years were included if they presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or syncope and underwent testing for PE with D-dimer or imaging. Demographic and clinical data were exported from the electronic medical record (EMR). Pretest risk scores were calculated using manually abstracted EMR data. Diagnostic testing was then compared with recommended testing based on pretest risk. The primary outcome was receipt of guideline-consistent care, which required an elevated screening D-dimer prior to imaging in all non-high-risk patients.ResultsWe studied 1991 discrete patient encounters; 37% (735) of patients were male and 63% (1256) were female. Baseline characteristics, including revised Geneva scores, were similar between sexes. Female patients were more likely to receive guideline-consistent care (70% [874/1256] female vs. 63% [463/735] male, p < 0.01) and less likely to be diagnosed with PE (3.1% [39/1256] female vs. 5.3% [39/735] male, p < 0.05). The most common guideline deviation in both sexes was obtaining imaging without a screening D-dimer in a non-high-risk patient (75% [287/382] female vs. 75% [205/272] male).ConclusionsIn this cohort, females were more likely than males to receive care consistent with current guidelines and less likely to be diagnosed with PE.

UK-based multicentre cross-sectional study assessing advice requests veterinary dermatologists received from general practitioners	VETERINARY RECORD			English	Article							DISEASE SURVEILLANCE; DOGS; PREVALENCE; HORSES; HEALTH; CARE; TELEDERMATOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS	Background: There is little currently little information available regarding the nature of the advice requests veterinary dermatologists receive from general practitioners. Collation of such data could direct continuing veterinary development in the future. Methods: Dermatologists completed hand-written recording sheets during or after enquiries. Information recorded included the route of enquiry, nature of advice, material provided, practice type and location, animal signalment, presenting signs, diagnosis/differential diagnosis, treatment and referral recommendations, time taken and if charges were made. Results: Twelve dermatology services recorded 768 advice requests over a 6-month period. Most requests were submitted via email and related to canine dermatology (81%). An average of 9.5 minutes was spent replying to requests. Charges weremade in 2% of cases. Advice regarding otitis was most commonly sought, followed by pruritus, alopecia and crusting. The most frequently discussed diagnoses included allergy, otitis, pyoderma, demodicosis, dermatophytosis and neoplasia. Antibiotics, anti-pruritics and topical otic medications were the most commonly discussed therapeutics. Limitations: This is an initial study and therefore there are limitations involving the depth of the data. Additional studies should be completed which identify why advice is sought, decision-making regarding referral, and if advice should be charged similarly to other disciplines. Conclusions: These findings highlight that veterinarians mostly frequently seek advice on management of common dermatological problems, including allergy, otitis and pyoderma.

Evaluating depression anxiety and stress assessment before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using generalisability theory	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Depression; Anxiety and stress scale; Generalisability theory; Reliability; State and trait; Psychometrics	RELIABILITY; SCALE	The current study investigated the assessment of depression, anxiety, and stress during normal and COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Generalisability theory (G-theory) was applied to examine stable and dynamic aspects of psychological distress and the overall reliability of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), using data from two independent samples collected on three occasions with 2- to 4-week intervals. The US data (n = 115) was collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the New Zealand (NZ) data (n = 114) was obtained during the pandemic. The total DASS-21 demonstrated excellent reliability in measuring enduring symptoms of psychological distress (G = .94-.96) across both samples. While all DASS-21 subscales demonstrated good reliability with the pre-pandemic US sample, the subscales' reliability was below an acceptable level for the NZ sample. Findings from this study indicate that the overall psychological distress is enduring and can be reliably measured by the DASS-21 across different conditions and populations, while shifts across depression, anxiety and stress levels are likely during emergency and uncertainty, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Makimoto, F				Makimoto, Fukashi			The effectiveness of <i>goreisan</i>, for gestational edema and amniotic fluid decrease	TRADITIONAL & KAMPO MEDICINE			English	Review; Early Access						amniotic fluid; aquaporin; gestational edema; goreisan; oligohydramnios; wulingsan	POCKET	Objective: Ordinarily, a diuretic uniformly performs diuresis of body water and decreases it. When a diuretic is used for gestational edema, blood vessel dehydration and amniotic fluid are expected to decrease. This may be rather harmful for the gestational prognosis. Goreisan's mechanism of efficacy is different from that of ordinary diuretics. The results of treating gestational edema and amniotic fluid reduction with goreisan were studied. Whether goreisan is helpful for improving gestational prognosis was studied. Clinical results: Goreisan is effective in the treatment of gestational edema. During edematous treatment, goreisan exhibits a diuretic effect. After edema has improved, goreisan does not exhibit a compulsory diuresis effect. These effects were ascertained by examining the change in the expectant mother's weight. Goreisan appeared to normalize the gross body water volume. In the presence of edema, a reduction in the amniotic fluid volume was often apparent after 36 weeks of gestation. Treatment of gestational edema by goreisan prevented the reduction of the amniotic fluid volume. Maximum vertical pocket (MVP) changes before and after treatment with goreisan for oligohydramnios were studied. Goreisan prospectively appeared to exhibit a therapeutic effect on oligohydramnios. Conclusion: Goreisan contributes to improvement in the prognosis of the course of gestation. Goreisan, rather than diuretics, corrects the maldistribution of body water. Only Kampo medicine has these activities for water metabolism. Ordinary diuretics cannot be substituted for these medicines.

A trans-dinitrosylantimony(V) corrole compound has been proposed as a possible reaction intermediate that is subsequently converted into a trans-dinitroantimony(V) corrole product. The formation of these intermediate species has been established via in situ FT-IR spectra. This trans-dinitroantimony(V) corrole species can transfer the nitro group to the beta-pyrrole positions (C3 and C17) of the corrole periphery via a radical pathway. The binding of fluoride to the axial positions of antimony(V) corrole occurs via nucleophilic attack of fluoride ion from BF4-. The trans-difluoroantimony(V) 3,17-dinitro-corrole complexes are fully characterized via X-ray crystallography, UV-vis, FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopy. They catalyze oxygenation reactions under photo-redox conditions in presence of air and light at ambient temperature by forming singlet oxygen.

Design: Retrospective analysis of data from the Indian PHPT registry.Patients: PHPT patients were divided into four discrete groups: asymptomatic, presenting with renal manifestations alone, skeletal manifestations alone, and both skeletal and renal manifestations. Measurements: Clinical, biochemical, and tumour weight and histopathological characteristics of these groups were compared. Results: Of the 229 eligible patients, 45 were asymptomatic, 62 had renal manifestations, 55 had skeletal manifestations, and 67 had both skeletal and renal manifestations. Patients with both skeletal and renal manifestations had higher serum calcium levels than those with isolated skeletal involvement [12.5 (11.1-13.7) mg/dL, 11.2 (10.6-12.3) mg/dL, respectively; p < .05]. Serum alkaline phosphatase (AP), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and parathyroid tumour weight were significantly higher in patients with isolated skeletal, and both skeletal and renal manifestations, compared to the other two groups. A preoperative PTH and AP level of 300 pg/mL and 152 U/L, predicted the risk of developing skeletal involvement with sensitivity and specificity of 71%, 70%, and 69%, 67%, respectively. Conclusions: We observed distinct skeletal and renal phenotypic subgroups among PHPT patients with characteristic biochemical and hormonal patterns with higher parathyroid disease burden in patients with skeletal complications compared to those with isolated renal manifestation.

When examining diverse classes of echinoderms, typically three, sometimes four, nanos genes are present. In this analysis, we identify and annotate nine nanos orthologs in the green sea urchin, Lytechinus variegatus (Lv). All nine genes are transcribed and grouped into three distinct classes. Class one includes the germline Nanos, with one member: Nanos2. Class two includes Nanos3-like genes, with significant sequence similarity to Nanos3 in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp), but with wildly variable expression patterns. The third class includes several previously undescribed nanos zinc-finger genes that may be the result of duplications of Nanos2. All nine nanos transcripts occupy unique genomic loci and are expressed with unique temporal profiles during development. Importantly, here we describe and characterize the unique genomic location, conservation, and phylogeny of the Lv ortholog of the well-studied Sp Nanos2. However, in addition to the conserved germline functioning Nanos2, the green sea urchin appears to be an outlier in the echinoderm phyla with eight additional nanos genes. We hypothesize that this expansion of nanos gene members may be the result of a previously uncharacterized L1-class transposon encoded on the opposite strand of a nanos2 pseudogene present on chromosome 12 in this species. The expansion of nanos genes described here represents intriguing insights into germline specification and nanos evolution in this species of sea urchin.

J	Sadri, M; Piazza, A; Phung, K; Helms, W				Sadri, Mohamad; Piazza, Alessandro; Phung, Kam; Helms, Wesley			The disparate economic outcomes of stigma: Evidence from the arms industry	STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						arms producers; cumulative abnormal returns; labels; legitimacy; stigma	CORPORATE SOCIAL-RESPONSIBILITY; ORGANIZATIONAL STIGMA; IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT; STOCK RETURNS; LEGITIMACY; MARKET; EVENT; MISCONDUCT; REPUTATION; AUTHORITY	Research Summary: Organizational stigma has been commonly associated with a number of negative economic externalities in prior literature, but the mechanism by which this occurs and the extent of the associated consequences have received little attention. We address these gaps by theorizing that stigmatizing labels damage the legitimacy of the target by highlighting a deviation from the expectations of relevant audiences. We also argue that the content and focus of stigmatizing labels, as well as the features of the stigmatizer audience deploying them, will affect the magnitude of the negative economic consequences of stigma. Through an analysis linking the condemnation of arms producers in the media between 1998 and 2016 to cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) in the stock market, we find broad support for our arguments.Managerial Summary: This paper examines the economic impact of stakeholder criticism on firms, using data from the global arms industry to develop a typology of criticism based on its content, focus, and origin. We find that criticism can negatively affect a firm's stock market returns, particularly when those criticizing have the authority to condemn specific behaviors. Civil society entities like nonprofits or the media, politicians, and economic players such as investors each have unique authority to criticize harmful behavior, illegal behavior, and unethical affiliations, respectively. Understanding the different types of criticism and their potential economic consequences can help firms better manage stakeholder relationships and mitigate negative impacts on their financial performance.

This article poses the research question: What is the relationship between corporate purpose and the SDGs?, and develops a model to explain this relationship drawing upon semistructured interviews with managers of Fortune Global 500 companies in Japan. The findings suggest two perspectives of corporate purpose, goal-based and duty-based, influence the relationship. Two-thirds of the companies implemented both perspectives and integrated the SDGs at multiple levels in their organizations whereas one-third only implemented duty-based purpose and integrated the SDGs at the operational level. The paper contributes to theorizing the relationship between corporate purpose and corporate engagement with the SDGs drawing upon empirical evidence. The model provides guidance to managers on how to use the purpose to help drive their contributions to the SDGs.

The approach to diagnosis is still based on symptomatic description without objective validation. In this study, we aimed to compare the peripheral blood levels of hypothesized biomarker proteins: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proBDNF, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and S100B between early-onset schizophrenia-spectrum adolescents (n = 45) and healthy controls (n = 34).Methods: Clinical assessment of the participants encompassed symptomatic description with the use of structured interviews and executive function objective measurement. Plasma levels of BDNF protein were significantly lower in schizophrenia patients than in controls both at admission (p = .003) and 6-8 weeks follow-up (p = .007).Results: We observed significant correlations between BDNF, proBDNF and p75(NTR) levels and positive and negative symptoms scale (PANSS) scores, p75(NTR) and S100B levels and suicidal parameters, as well as a correlation of BDNF plasma level with the risky decision-making style in Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).Conclusions: The results indicate a potential value of studied proteins as a biomarker in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease's course.

Variation in mesopredator abundance and nest predation rate of the endangered Strange-tailed Tyrant (<i>Alectrurus risora</i>)	IBIS			English	Article						breeding biology; camera trap; mesopredator release; nest concealment; nest predators; subtropical grasslands	SITE SELECTION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; GRASSLAND BIRDS; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; PATTERNS; RELEASE; RISK; DISPARITIES; EXTINCTION	Nest predation is the main cause of nest failure in passerine birds and thus is a key determinant of breeding traits. Accordingly, nest predator community composition and abundance modulate nest predation rates. When top predators are absent, mesopredator populations may become unchecked, which in turn increases the predation pressure on their prey species. We evaluated whether nest predator abundance and breeding traits of an endangered grassland bird, the Strange-tailed Tyrant Alectrurus risora, differed between two protected areas: Ibera National Park (INP), where top predators have been extinct for 50?years, and Reserva El Bagual (REB), where Pumas Puma concolor still have a stable population. We measured abundances of potential nest predator species and during the 2015-2018 breeding seasons we monitored Strange-tailed Tyrant nests and set camera traps to identify nest predators. Mesopredator abundance was higher in INP, and foxes were identified as the main nest predators. Nest predation rate was also higher in INP, where the daily nest predation rate and cumulative probability of nest predation were 0.05 +/- 0.006 and 0.81, whereas in REB they were 0.04 +/- 0.004 and 0.70, respectively. The 10-fold higher frequency of fox records in INP could explain the higher nest predation rate observed, suggesting that the extinction of top predators may increase nest predation rates of endangered grassland birds in protected areas through release of native mesopredator species. The lower nest predation observed in REB was compensated for by a higher nest abandonment rate, which resulted in a similar fledgling production in the two study sites. Clutch size, hatching success and number of nestlings did not differ between study sites. The low breeding success recorded for this endangered species despite its populations being in protected areas of high conservation value is alarming given the global decline that grassland bird populations are facing.

J	Chen, Y; Wu, JF; Li, YW				Chen, Yang; Wu, Jiafeng; Li, Yingwei			A "Catalysis-Immobilization-Deposition" Stepwise Strategy toward Dynamic Equilibrium of Polysulfides Conversion and Diffusion in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries	SMALL METHODS			English	Article						catalysis-immobilization-deposition; dynamic equilibrium; lithium-sulfur batteries; stepwise electrocatalysts; synergistic effect		Stepwise electrocatalysis can remarkably accelerate the kinetics of two consecutive reactions in sulfur electrochemistry. However, the significant difference between the catalysis and diffusion rates of polysulfides results in persistent shuttling in the stepwise electrocatalysts. Here, a stepwise electrocatalytic strategy of catalysis-immobilization-deposition is proposed for achieving the consistency of diffusion and catalysis of polysulfides. Accordingly, a sandwich-like stepwise electrocatalyst is designed, which is composed of Co nanoparticles (Co-NP), mesoporous SiO2, and iron single atom (Fe-SA) (denoted as Co-NP@SiO2@Fe-SA), serving as catalysis core, immobilization interlayer, and deposition shell, respectively. Benefitting from the dynamic equilibrium between production and consumption of polysulfides achieved by the spatial synergistic effect of the triple sites, the S/Co-NP@SiO2@Fe-SA cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 731 mAh g(-1) over 500 cycles at 1 C with a small capacity decay of 0.039% per cycle. Moreover, a high areal capacity of 3.8 mAh cm(-2) at a sulfur loading of 4.5 mg cm(-2) is achieved with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5.9. This work sheds light on a new host design concept with high catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity to enable high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

We examined the association of physical activity with epigenetic ageing and the role of immune function and cardiovascular risk factors in mediating this relation. Moreover, we aimed to identify novel molecular processes underlying the association between physical activity and epigenetic ageing. We analysed cross-sectional data from 3567 eligible participants (mean age: 55.5 years, range: 30-94 years, 54.8% women) of the Rhineland Study, a community-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany. Physical activity components (metabolic equivalent (MET)-Hours, step counts, sedentary, light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities) were recorded with accelerometers. DNA methylation was measured with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Epigenetic age acceleration (Hannum's age, Horvath's age, PhenoAge and GrimAge) was calculated based on published algorithms. The relation between physical activity and epigenetic ageing was examined with multivariable regression, while structural equation modeling was used for mediation analysis. Moreover, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study of physical activity across 850,000 CpG sites. After adjustment for age, sex, season, education, smoking, cell proportions and batch effects, physical activity (step counts, MET-Hours and %time spend in moderate-to-vigorous activities) was non-linearly associated with slower epigenetic ageing, in part through its beneficial effects on immune function and cardiovascular health. Additionally, we identified 12 and 7 CpGs associated with MET-Hours and %time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activities, respectively (p < 1 x 10(-5)). Our findings suggest that regular physical activity slows epigenetic ageing by counteracting immunosenescence and lowering cardiovascular risk.	[Fox, Fabienne A. U.; Liu, Dan; Breteler, Monique M.

Mood changes and clinical decision making in adolescent patients on isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris	PEDIATRIC DERMATOLOGY			English	Article						acne vulgaris; adolescent; depression; isotretinoin; mood changes	DEPRESSION	Although numerous studies have demonstrated no causal relationship between isotretinoin and depression or suicide, subtle mood changes and idiosyncratic mood symptoms have been reported in patients on isotretinoin treatment for acne vulgaris, and few studies have described the full range of mood symptoms and clinical course after a mood change arises. We reviewed 247 patients, ages 10-25 years, with acne vulgaris on isotretinoin and found that 26/247 (10.5%) patients experienced mood changes, the most common being depressive symptoms, anxiety, aggression, and emotional lability. Regardless of treatment management, 22/25 (88%) patients experienced improvement of mood symptoms to baseline, and 22/25 (88%) were able to complete their isotretinoin course without symptom recurrence. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring for a broad range of mood changes in patients on isotretinoin, especially those related to a pre-existing mood disorder and including those which do not meet formal criteria for a psychiatric disorder.

Large areas of the coastal zone of Bangladesh remain fallow during the dry season primarily due to salinity. It is estimated that 0.86 million hectares of land currently under fallow in the dry season would be suitable for wheat production using varieties with enhanced salt tolerance. This study investigated the impact of salt tolerance Nax genes (Na+ exclusion) on the grain yield of bread wheat grown on saline soils in southern Bangladesh. Nax1 and Nax2 genes were separately crossed into two Bangladeshi bread wheat varieties, BARI Gom 25 and BARI Gom 26, through conventional crossing with marker-assisted selection. The key outcome was strong evidence that both Nax genes have the capacity to lower leaf Na+ concentration in locally adapted bread wheat and consequently deliver improved yields in challenging field environments in southern Bangladesh with moderate to high salinity. The genetic backgrounds of the adapted varieties played a significant role in the expression of these genes. There was a differential response in the phenotypic expression of Nax genes to reduce leaf Na+ levels between the two local varieties selected as recurrent parents and the resultant variation in yield. The average reduction in leaf Na+ concentrations from the third backcrossed lines in the BARI Gom 25 background was about twice that of lines in the BARI Gom 26 background. These same lines typically yielded between 10% and 20% higher than BARI Gom 25 on moderate to high salinity sites, whereas the backcrossed lines in the BARI Gom 26 background yielded similarly to their recurrent parent at these same sites. The contrast in the differential phenotypic expression of the Nax genes evident in the two recurrent parents represented in this study highlights the importance of crossing salt tolerance Nax genes into a range of locally adapted high-yielding genetic backgrounds to identify the greatest potential for improvement in salt tolerance.

The empirical results show that ETS had a positive effect on GTFEE. A series of robustness tests revealed that the results were robust. Potential mechanisms through which ETS can improve GTFEE include the promotion of technological innovation and the upgrading of industrial structure. The positive effects varied in different cities and different regions - the result was pronounced in eastern China and developed cities, but it was insignificant in central and western areas and developing cities. This study confirms the satisfactory performance of China's ETS in improving GTFEE, and this is relevant for other emerging countries.

One possible solution is to select robust additive to suppress the shuttling transformation. In this work, three AlON powders with different median particle sizes of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.1 mu m were prepared. After studying the effect of CaCO3 on densification process, AlON ceramics with the maximum transmittance of >= 81.1% were successfully fast prepared by pressureless sintering (PS) at 1880 degrees C for only 2.5 h by using three AlON powders doped with different CaCO3 amount. Specifically, AlON ceramics prepared from 1.1 mu m with 0.5-0.8 wt.% CaCO3 doping consistently showed the maximum transmittance of >= 85.3%, which indicates that CaCO3 can serve as a robust additive to enable fast fabrication of highly transparent AlON ceramics even by PS.

They show low phenotypic and molecular differentiation due to their recent, rapid, and reticulate speciation during the Quaternary period. In this study, we evaluate the boundaries of the monocot-like Eryngium regnellii and a closely related entity from the grasslands in the Cerrado of Paraguay. We integrated evidence from multiple data sources to test species delimitation: we estimated the phylogenetic position of both entities within Eryngium based on ITS nrDNA and cpDNA sequences; we carried out univariate and multivariate morphometric analyses to test statistically significant differences and to recognize morphological diagnostic characters; we also analyzed geographic distribution, habitat, and bioclimatic variables to evaluate divergence in environmental niche, and finally, we used Bayesian coalescent-based delimitation approaches to test genetic structure. Divergence in morphology, environmental niche, and genetic structure between E. regnellii and the lineage from Paraguay support the hypothesis of evolutionary independence among these two lineages. Therefore, based on an integrative approach, we recognize and describe a new species from Paraguay: Eryngium cerradense.

We present the case of a 55-year-old man who developed a tender, reducible inguinal bulge and underwent laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair under the clinical diagnosis of an inguinal hernia. Intraoperative observation revealed no hernia sac, but a poorly defined spermatic cord mass, appearing to be responsible for the patient's symptoms, was found and removed. The pathology of the mass was consistent with the diagnosis of an arteriovenous malformation of the spermatic cord. Surgeons should keep in mind the small possibility of arteriovenous malformations in patients with clinical presentation of an inguinal hernia, as they may cause massive bleeding during and after the operation unless handled appropriately.

J	Olma, N				Olma, Nikolaos			The Collective Image of the City: Informal Taxis and the Production of Vernacular Toponyms in Tashkent, Uzbekistan	CITY & SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						informal taxis; mental maps; Tashkent; vernacular toponyms; wayfinding	STREET NAMES; SOCIALIST; POLITICS; GEOGRAPHIES; BUCHAREST; IDENTITY; POWER	Decades of politically motivated place renaming have prompted the population of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to adopt a bottom-up vernacular toponymic register, wherein locations are indicated in relation to points of reference known as orientiry. Orientiry take cues from the built environment and are generated through the population's affective pluritemporal engagements with the city. Accordingly, they can take different material forms, but they can also be dropped or discursively replaced by new ones situated temporally or physically closer to the population's everyday experiences. This article argues that orientiry are kept more or less coherent by the need for Tashkent dwellers to indicate locations to their fellow residents and especially to Tashkent's informal taxi drivers. Orientiry are proliferated and standardized by the exchange of environmental information that occurs between driver and passenger as they find their way through various places and temporalities. The article demonstrates how a combination of cognition, affect, and social stimuli shapes wayfinding in Tashkent, revealing the city's orientiry as a representation of a collective image of the city-an assemblage of individual mental maps that overlap, interfere, contradict, and exclude one another and yet remain functional by similar habitual use of the city.

Although a large number of studies have reported that Fe2O3 NPs could induce hepatotoxicity, the pathogenesis is still unclear, especially the subacute effects on the metabolic network after oral exposure. Therefore, it is necessary to define a highly sensitive strategy to investigate the potential effects of Fe2O3 NPs and the mechanism. In this study, an animal experiment showed that Fe2O3 NPs had no obvious toxic effects on body weight, histopathology and oxide stress. In order to further investigate the potential effects of Fe2O3 NPs in vivo, a more sensitive LC-MS/MS-based lipidomic study was performed. The results of multivariate statistical analysis and western blot analysis showed that Fe2O3 NP exposure significantly affects the hepatic glycerophospholipid metabolism, decreasing triacylglycerol, diglyceride, lysophosphatidylethanolamine and free fatty acids, and increasing phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylinositol and coenzyme Q9. These data provide further insight into the hepatic subacute effects of Fe2O3 NPs obtained by conventional toxicology methods.

Anatomical functional traits and hydraulic vulnerability of trees in different water conditions in southern Amazonia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Brazilian Cerrado; cavitation; functional traits; leaf blade; tropical rainforest; water deficit	LEAF ANATOMY; CAVITATION RESISTANCE; EXPERIMENTAL DROUGHT; TROPICAL FORESTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; WOOD ANATOMY; CARBON SINK; MATO-GROSSO; VEGETATION	PremiseUnderstanding tree species' responses to drought is critical for predicting the future of tropical forests, especially in regions where the climate is changing rapidly. MethodsWe compared anatomical and functional traits of the dominant tree species of two tropical forests in southern Amazonia, one on deep, well-drained soils (cerradao [CD]) and one in a riparian environment (gallery forest [GF]), to examine potential anatomical indicators of resistance or vulnerability to drought. ResultsLeaves of CD species generally had a thicker cuticle, upper epidermis, and mesophyll than those of GF species, traits that are indicative of adaptation to water deficit. In the GF, the theoretical hydraulic conductivity of the stems was significantly higher, indicating lower investment in drought resistance. The anatomical functional traits of CD species indicate a greater potential for surviving water restriction compared to the GF. Even so, it is possible that CD species could also be affected by extreme climate changes due to the more water-limited environment. ConclusionsIn addition to the marked anatomical and functional differences between these phytophysiognomies, tree diversity within each is associated with a large range of hydraulic morphofunctional niches. Our results suggest the strong potential for floristic and functional compositional shifts under continued climate change, especially in the GF.

The aldehydic functional group is reactive and, as such, an invaluable chemical multi-tool to make all sorts of products. Owing to the reactivity, the selective synthesis of aldehydic is a challenging task. Nature has evolved a number of enzymatic reactions to produce aldehydes, and this review provides an overview of aldehyde-forming reactions in biological systems and beyond. Whereas some of these biotransformations are still in their infancy in terms of synthetic applicability, others are developed to an extent that allows their implementation as industrial biocatalysts.

MethodsEighteen PD patients with fatigue (PD-F), 20 PD patients without fatigue (PD-NF), and 23 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and analyzed by the voxel-wise degree centrality (DC) and the seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Meanwhile, the surface-based morphometry (SBM) analysis was also commanded to explore the structural alternations among groups. ResultsPD-F patients displayed reduced DC values in the left postcentral gyrus relative to PD-NF and HCs groups, while increased DC values in the bilateral precuneus compared to HCs. Simultaneously, altered DC value in the left postcentral gyrus negatively corresponded to the mean fatigue severity scale (FSS) in PD-F patients. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves uncovered that the reduced DC value of the left postcentral gyrus could discriminate PD-F from PD-NF and HCs groups. Our FC analysis further revealed that altered FC was located predominantly in the sensorimotor network in the PD-F group. Moreover, we discovered no statistically significant differences between the three groups concerning cortical thickness. ConclusionOur findings indicated that the altered functional connectivity in the sensorimotor network centering on the left postcentral gyrus and the bilateral precuneus might be the potential pathogenesis of PD with fatigue.

Large numbers of adults are attracted by aggregation pheromone [methyl (E,E,Z)-2,4,6-decatrienoate] and cause extensive damage to the fruit. To identify olfactory-related genes in P. stali, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of adult antennae. Among the 27299 contigs, 16 putative odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes were identified and designated as PstaOBP1-16, including 10 classic (i.e., containing six conserved cysteines) and six Plus-C (i.e., containing more than six cysteines) OBP genes. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that four genes (PstaOBP1, 3, 6, and 7) were strongly expressed in the antennae. PstaOBP2 was detected throughout the insect body, with higher expression in the antennae, stylet, and tarsus. The remaining OBP genes were expressed in very small amounts. PstaOBP1, which showed the highest expression in adult antennae, was expressed in Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani & Chalmers cells and the recombinant protein was subjected to a ligand-binding competitive assay. PstaOBP1 bound to methyl (E,E,Z)-2,4,6-decatrienoate with high affinity. Of the other 26 compounds tested, hinokitiol and tropolone bound strongly to PstaOBP1. Hinokitiol is an odor component of hinoki cypress, a host tree of P. stali. Electrophysiological responses to methyl (E,E,Z)-2,4,6-decatrienoate and hinokitiol were detected using adult P. stali antennae. Combined, these results suggest that PstaOBP1 is involved in P. stali responses to pheromone and host plant volatiles.

Uncertainty of spatial averages and totals of natural resource maps	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						block kriging; change of support; geostatistics; machine learning; mapping spatial aggregation; quantile regression forest	PREDICTIONS; STOCKS; SUPPORT; SOILS; MODEL	1. Global, continental and regional maps of concentrations, stocks and fluxes of natural resources provide baseline data to assess how ecosystems respond to human disturbance and global warming. They are also used as input to numerous modelling efforts. But these maps suffer from multiple error sources and, hence, it is good practice to report estimates of the associated map uncertainty so that users can evaluate their fitness for use. 2.We explain why quantification of uncertainty of spatial aggregates is more complex than uncertainty quantification at point support because it must account for spatial autocorrelation of the map errors. Unfortunately, this is not done in a number of recent high-profile studies. We describe how spatial autocorrelation of map errors can be accounted for with block kriging, a method that requires geostatistical expertise. Next, we propose a new, model-based approach that avoids the numerical complexity of block kriging and is feasible for large-scale studies where maps are typically made using machine learning. Our approach relies on Monte Carlo integration to derive the uncertainty of the spatial average or total from point support prediction errors. We account for spatial autocorrelation of the map error by geostatistical modelling of the standardized map error. 3. We show that the uncertainty strongly depends on the spatial autocorrelation of the map errors. In a first case study, we used block kriging to show that the uncertainty of the predicted topsoil organic carbon in France decreases when the support increases. In a second case study, we estimated the uncertainty of spatial aggregates of a machine learning map of the above-ground biomass in Western Africa using Monte Carlo integration. We found that this uncertainty was small because of the weak spatial autocorrelation of the standardized map errors. 4. We present a tool to get realistic estimates of the uncertainty of spatial averages and totals of natural resource maps. The method presented in this paper is essential for parties that need to evaluate whether differences in aggregated environmental variables or natural resources between regions or over time are statistically significant.

However, there have been few investigations about the role of chronic coffee consumption in nigrostriatal structural neurodegeneration in PD. We aimed to investigate whether chronic coffee consumption is associated with the change in striatal volume in PD. Methods: In this study, 130 de novo patients with PD and 69 healthy controls were enrolled from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Patients with PD and healthy controls were, respectively, divided into three subgroups, including current, ever, and never coffee consumers. Then, striatal volume was compared across the three subgroups. Correlation analyses were performed to assess the relationship between cups consumed per day and striatal volume. Furthermore, we included the factors that may have influenced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in multiple linear regression analyses to identify significant contributing factors to striatal volume in each investigated striatal region. Results: Current coffee consumers had decreased striatal volume compared with ever consumers in controls but not patients with PD. Furthermore, the correlation analyses revealed that cups per day were negatively correlated with striatal volume in current consumers of patients with PD and controls. In addition, multiple linear regression analyses showed that current coffee consumption remained as an independent predictor of a decrease in striatal volume in controls. Conclusions: Our study showed that chronic coffee consumption was negatively correlated with striatal volume. In addition, our study showed that chronic coffee consumption was associated with the change in striatal volume in current-rather than ever coffee consumers, which suggests that the chronic effects of caffeine on striatal morphology may fade and even compensate after quitting coffee. Our study provides evidence for the effect of chronic coffee consumption on striatal volume in human brain in vivo.

However, how to promote endometrium repair is always a challenge. Here, a bioactive injectable and self-healing hydrogel is developed by physically combination of thiolated polyethylene (PEG), Cu2+ and cell-free fat extract (CEFFE, CF) for endometrial regeneration and fertility. By inheriting the advantages of various active proteins contained in CEFFE, it could induce the overall repair of endometrial microenvironment for intrauterine adhesion (IUA). In vitro, CF@Cu-PEG reduces endometrial cell apoptosis by more than 50%, and increases angiogenesis by 92.8%. In the IUA mouse, injection of CF@Cu-PEG significantly reduces the rate of uterine hydrometra and prevents the formation of endometrial fibrosis. Remarkably, CF@Cu-PEG contributes to the repair of endometrial microstructure, especially increases the number of endometrial pinopodes, significantly improves endometrial receptivity, and increases the pregnancy rate of IUA mice from 7.14% to 66.67%. In summary, through the physically combination of CEFFE and Cu-PEG, the construction of loaded bioactive injectable hydrogel not only inhibits the IUA, but also induces the self-repair of endometrial cells in situ and improves fertility, providing a new strategy for IUA repair in clinical application.

Here, this work shows that through strong ligand-mediated interfacial energy control, Au-Cu2O dumbbell structures where both the Au nanorod (AuNR) and the partially encapsulating Cu2O domains are highly crystalline. The synthetic advance allows physical separation of the Au and Cu2O domains, in addition to the use of long nanorods with tunable absorption wavelength, and the crystalline Cu2O domain with well-defined facets. The interplay of plasmon and Schottky effects boosts the photocatalytic performance in the model photodegradation of methyl orange, showing superior catalytic efficiency than the AuNR@Cu2O core-shell structures. In addition, compared to the typical core-shell structures, the AuNR-Cu2O dumbbells can effectively electrochemically catalyze the CO2 to C2+ products (ethanol and ethylene) via a cascade reaction pathway. The excellent dual function of both photo- and electrocatalysis can be attributed to the fine physical separation of the crystalline Au and Cu2O domains.

To realize the function of stereoscopic imaging, optoelectronic sensors shall possess good photoresponsive performance, multidirectional sensing, and 3D building capabilities. However, the current imaging sensors are mainly focused on 2D imaging, limiting their practical application scenarios. In this study, a stereopsis-inspired flexible 3D visual imaging system (VIS) based on 2D Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite is demonstrated. The 3D-VIS consists of 800 device units, each of which demonstrates excellent photoresponse performance, mechanical characteristics, and environmental stability. In addition to the capability of detecting 2D reflective images, the 3D-VIS realizes the function of detecting the depth of field and fusing object projections of two directions to invert the 3D image by utilizing voxels to rebuild the spatial structure of the object. In the future, the 3D-VIS will have broad application prospects in medical imaging, virtual reality, industrial automation, and other fields.

Replicate DNA metabarcoding can discriminate seasonal and spatial abundance shifts in river macroinvertebrate assemblages	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						abundance; biomonitoring; detectability; DNA metabarcoding; occupancy; taxonomic resolution	SPECIES RICHNESS; FISH PREDATION; OCCUPANCY; MODELS; STREAM; COMMUNITIES; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; SAMPLE; SIZE	The delivery of consistent and accurate fine-resolution data on biodiversity using metabarcoding promises to improve environmental assessment and research. Whilst this approach is a substantial improvement upon traditional techniques, critics note that metabarcoding data are suitable for establishing taxon occurrence, but not abundance. We propose a novel hierarchical approach to recovering abundance information from metabarcoding, and demonstrate this technique using benthic macroinvertebrates. To sample a range of abundance structures without introducing additional changes in composition, we combined seasonal surveys with fish-exclusion experiments at Catamaran Brook in northern New Brunswick, Canada. Five monthly surveys collected 31 benthic samples for DNA metabarcoding divided between caged and control treatments. A further six samples per survey were processed using traditional morphological identification for comparison. By estimating the probability of detecting a single individual, multispecies abundance models infer changes in abundance based on changes in detection frequency. Using replicate detections of 184 genera (and 318 species) from metabarcoding samples, our analysis identified changes in abundance arising from both seasonal dynamics and the exclusion of fish predators. Counts obtained from morphological samples were highly variable, a feature that limited the opportunity for more robust comparison, and emphasizing the difficulty standard methods also face to detect changes in abundance. Our approach is the first to demonstrate how quantitative estimates of abundance can be made using metabarcoding, both among species within sites as well as within species among sites. Many samples are required to capture true abundance patterns, particularly in streams where counts are highly variable, but few studies can afford to process entire samples. Our approach allows study of responses across whole communities, and at fine taxonomic resolution. We discuss how ecological studies can use additional sampling to capture changes in abundance at fine resolution, and how this can complement broad-scale biomonitoring using DNA metabarcoding.

As a newcomer to thin-film solar cells, the quality of the as-prepared absorb layer remains the most difficult challenge, owing to its distinct crystal structure. Here, a solvent-assisted hydrothermal deposition (SHD) technique is developed for direct deposition of high-quality Sb-2(S,Se)(3) films; it is realized that the addition of ethanol can regulate the reaction kinetics by regulating the concentration of the Sb source during the deposition procedure. Impressively, under such conditions, the deposition rate of the target absorb layer slows dramatically, resulting in more suitable features, such as large grain size, smooth surface, and proper bandgap, which are beneficial for constructing high performance solar devices. More importantly, using this newly developed SHD strategy, the defect (Sb-S1) density of the prepared films decreases by more than one order of magnitude, which is believed to benefit carrier transport. As a result, Sb-2(S,Se)(3) solar cells based on the SHD strategy significantly improve fill factor and short-circuit current density, yielding a high efficiency of 10.75%. This research offers fresh insights into how to make Sb-2(S,Se)(3) films and solar cells of higher quality.

AimsBased on the concept of semantic congruence, we explored the effects of metacognitive prompts and numerical ordinality on information searching and cognitive processing, throughout the process of solving mathematical word problems among primary school students in China. SampleParticipants included 73 primary school students (38 boys and 35 girls) with normal or corrected visual acuity. MethodsThis study was based on a 2 (prompt information: no-prompt, metacognitive-prompt) x 2 (number attribute: cardinal number, ordinal number) mixed experimental design. We analysed multiple eye-movement indices, such as fixation duration, saccadic amplitude, and pupil size, since they pertained to the areas of interest. ResultsWhen solving both types of problems, pupil sizes were significantly smaller under the metacognitive-prompt condition compared with the no-prompt condition, and shorter dwell time for specific sentences, conditional on metacognitive prompts, indicated the optimization of the presented algorithm. Additionally, the levels of fixation durations and saccadic amplitudes were significantly higher when solving ordinal number word problems compared with solving ordinal number problems, indicating that primary school students were less efficient in reading and faced increased levels of difficulty when solving ordinal number problems. ConclusionsThe results indicate that for Chinese upper-grade primary school students, cognitive load was lower in the metacognitive prompting condition and when solving cardinal problems, and higher when solving ordinal problems.

MethodsAfter applying 21 days of chronic unpredictable stress, male rats received intraperitoneal (IP) of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and then were exposed to ELF-EMF (10-Hz, 10-mT exposure conditions) for 3 days (3 h per day) and behavioral assessments were performed 24 h after the treatments. Instantly after the last behavioral test, the brain was extracted for Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR analyses. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to assess the effect of ketamine and ELF-EMF on the expression of astrocyte marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Also, real-time PCR analyses were used to investigate the impacts of the combination of ketamine and ELF-EMF on the expression of caspase3, p53, BDNF, and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus in rats submitted to the CUS procedure. Results were considered statistically significant when p Our results revealed that the combination of ketamine and ELF-EMF increased depression-like behavior, increased degenerated neurons and decreased the number of GFAP (+) cells in the CA1 area and mPFC, incremented the expression of caspase-3, and reduced the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus but showed no effect on the expression of p53 and NMDA-R. ConclusionsThese results reveal that combining ketamine and ELF-EMF has adverse effects on animals under chronic unpredictable stress (CUS).

Patients' and healthcare professionals' awareness of the presence of geriatric impairments could improve outcomes by tailoring treatment plans and decisions for individual patients. ObjectiveWe aimed to explore the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals on nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment to fuel decision-making for treatment choices in older patients with kidney failure. DesignIn an exploratory qualitative study using focus groups, participants discussed perspectives on the use and value of nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment for the decision-making process to start or forego dialysis. Participants and MeasurementsPatients (n = 18) with kidney failure, caregivers (n = 4), and professionals (n = 25) were purposively sampled from 10 hospitals. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and inductively analysed using thematic analysis. ResultsThree main themes emerged that supported or impeded decision-making in kidney failure: (1) patient psycho-social situation; (2) patient-related factors on modality choice; (3) organisation of health care. Patients reported feeling vulnerable due to multiple chronic conditions, old age, experienced losses in life and their willingness to trade longevity for quality of life. Professionals recognised the added value of nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment in three major themes: (i) facilitating continual holistic assessment, (ii) filling the knowledge gap, and (iii) uncovering important patient characteristics. Conclusionsnephrology-tailored geriatric assessment was perceived as a valuable tool to identify geriatric impairments in older patients with kidney failure. Integration of its outcomes can facilitate a more holistic approach to inform choices and decisions about kidney replacement therapy.	[Berkhout-Byrne, Noeleen C.; Voorend, Carlijn G.

Methods: A prospective, multicentric, emergency department delivery, pragmatic study was conducted. To determine the predictive capacity of the scales, lactate was measured and the mREMS and mREMS-L were calculated in adult patients (aged>18 years) transferred with high priority by ambulance to the emergency department in five hospitals of Castilla y Leon between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021. The area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC) curve of each of the scales was calculated in terms of mortality for 30 days. Results: A total of 5371 participants were included, and the in-hospital mortality rate at 30 days was of 11.4% (615 cases). The best cut-off point determined in the mREMS was 7.0 points (sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 84%), and for lactate, the cut-off point was 1.4 mmol/L (sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 67%). Finally, the combined mREMS-L showed a cut-off point of 7.9 (sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 83%). The area under the ROC curve of the mREMS, lactate and mREMS-L for 30-day mortality was 0.851, 0.853, and 0.903, respectively (p < 0.001 in all cases). Conclusions: The new score generated, mREMS-L, obtained better statistical results than its components (mREMS and lactate) separately.	[Calero, M.

Herein, inspired by endogenous reactions, a strategy is proposed to coactivate macrophage M1 polarization by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) with self-autocatalytic cascade reaction. To enhance the generation of NO and ROS, NO Precursor-Arginine as capping agents for inducing synthesis two kinds of chiral ruthenium nanozyme (D/L-Arginine@Ru). Under the properties of Ru nanozymes through synchronously mimicking the activity of oxidase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), chiral Ru nanozyme can rapidly generate O-1(2) and O-2 at first stage, and then catalyze Arginine to produce sufficient NO, thus enhance macrophage M1 polarization to reverse tumor immunosuppression. Moreover, combination the antitumor activity of O-1(2), NO, the chiral Ru nanozymes realize the "cocktail therapy" by inducing tumor cell apoptosis as well as ferroptosis. In addition, the chirality influences the bioactivity of Ru nanozymes that L-Arginine@Ru shows the better therapeutic effect with stronger catalytic activity and natural homology. It is hoped the high performance of chiral Ru nanozyme with "cocktail therapy" is an effective therapeutic reagent and can provide a feasible treatment strategy for tumor catalytic therapy.

Scholars do not agree on what kind of act sharing is and what kind of communicative and illocutionary act is performed when a post is shared. We defend the view that sharing is an act similar to photocopying and distributing a document. Such an act is a basic act that can be used for communicative aims in certain contexts but that is not necessarily communicative. One can repost for several reasons-to manifest agreement or derision, to inform, to please the author, to show activity on social networks, to have an economic return-and only some of them are communicative. However, even when reposters do not perform a communicative act, they are not relieved of every responsibility; in fact, the responsibilities of reposters are like those of the persons who copy and distribute something.

Viscous Microcapsules as Microbioreactors to Study Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells Osteolineage Commitment	SMALL METHODS			English	Article						dynamic microenvironment; mechanical cues; microbioreactors; osteogenic differentiation; shear stress	MARROW STROMAL CELLS; OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION; STEM-CELLS; FLUID; BONE; STRESS; OSTEOPONTIN; EXPRESSION; BEHAVIOR; CUES	It is essential to design a multifunctional well-controlled platform to transfer mechanical cues to the cells in different magnitudes. This study introduces a platform, a miniaturized bioreactor, which enables to study the effect of shear stress in microsized compartmentalized structures. In this system, the well-established cell encapsulation system of liquefied capsules (LCs) is used as microbioreactors in which the encapsulated cells are exposed to variable core viscosities to experience different mechanical forces under a 3D dynamic culture. The LC technology is joined with electrospraying to produce such microbioreactors at high rates, thus allowing the application of microcapsules for high-throughput screening. Using this platform for osteogenic differentiation as an example, shows that microbioreactors with higher core viscosity which produce higher shear stress lead to significantly higher osteogenic characteristics. Moreover, in this system the forces experienced by cells in each LC are simulated by computational modeling. The maximum wall shear stress applied to the cells inside the bioreactor with low, and high core viscosity environment is estimated to be 297 and 1367 mPa, respectively, for the experimental setup employed. This work outlines the potential of LC microbioreactors as a reliable in vitro customizable platform with a wide range of applications.

The synthesized nanophosphors were characterized for their structural, morphological, optical, and photoconductivity (PC) properties using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), photoluminescence (PL), and PC measurements. The sharp diffraction peaks of XRD results exhibit the formation of crystalline hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanostructures. The decrease in diffraction peak intensities of CZO with an increase in Ce concentrations signifies the deterioration of the ZnO crystal. FE-SEM images exhibit the good crystalline quality of nanophosphors composed of spherical- and elongated-shaped nanoparticles that are distributed consistently on the surface. The energy dispersive X-ray pattern of the 4 wt.% Ce-doped ZnO (CZO(4)) sample confirms the doping of Ce in ZnO. The presence of chemical bonds and functional groups corresponds to transmittance peaks established using FT-IR spectroscopy. Deconvoluted PL spectra show two major emission peaks, one in the UV region, which is near-band-edge, and the other in the visible region ranging from similar to 456 to 561 nm. In PC studies, current-voltage (I-V) and current-time (I-T) characteristics, that is, rise/decayin current under dark as well as UV light conditions, are also investigated. Efficient photoconduction is observed in CZO samples. The obtained results indicate the suitability to luminescent and photosensor applications.

In the present study, magnetite was prepared by calcination of natural siderite under an N-2 atmosphere and utilized as a heterogeneous material for sulfamethazine (SMT) degradation via peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. Various characterizations demonstrated that the S600 (siderite calcinated at 600 degrees C for 1 h) had a high specific surface area (57.18 m(2)/g) and high electron transfer ability. Under 1 g/L S600 and 1 mM PDS, 99.9% and 50% of SMT (5 mg/L) and TOC were eliminated in 2 h, with a kinetic constant of 0.026 min(-1). Increasing the S600 dosage and PDS concentration favored SMTdegradation, while inorganic anions and natural organicmatter had the opposite effect. Besides this, Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and scavenger experiment results demonstrated that hydroxyl radicals (about 62.3%) and sulfate radicals (about 20.2%) played a major role, while Fe(IV) (about 16.5%) played a minor role in SMT degradation. Moreover, various intermediates for SMT degradation were put forward based on the LC-MS/MS results and their toxicity was predicted to decrease. This work provides a vision for water treatment based on natural mineral materials and presents a new idea for the comprehensive utilization of siderite. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

Recent years witnessed the development of metal oxide-supported metal catalysts (MOSMCs), covering single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles. As alternatives to conventional carbon-dispersed metal catalysts, MOSMCs are gaining increasing interest due to their unique electronic configuration and potentially high corrosion resistance. By engineering the metal oxide substrate, supported metal, and their interactions, MOSMCs can be facilely modulated. Significant progress has been made in advancing MOSMCs for ORR, and their further development warrants advanced characterization methods to better understand MOSMCs and precise modulation strategies to boost their functionalities. In this regard, a comprehensive review of MOSMCs for ORR is still lacking despite this fast-developing field. To eliminate this gap, advanced characterization methods are introduced for clarifying MOSMCs experimentally and theoretically, discuss critical methods of boosting their intrinsic activities and number of active sites, and systematically overview the status of MOSMCs based on different metal oxide substrates for ORR. By conveying methods, research status, critical challenges, and perspectives, this review will rationally promote the design of MOSMCs for electrochemical energy devices.

J	Wang, ZQ; Lu, JW; Hu, JY				Wang, Zhenqian; Lu, Jiawen; Hu, Jingyi			Association between antihypertensive drugs and hepatocellular carcinoma: A trans-ancestry and drug-target Mendelian randomization study	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						antihypertensive drugs; drug-target; hepatocellular carcinoma; Mendelian randomization; trans-ancestry	NONSELECTIVE BETA-BLOCKERS; RISK; CANCER; HYPERTENSION; METAANALYSIS; INHIBITOR; THERAPY; VARICES; REDUCE; LOCI	Background and AimsAntihypertensive drugs were recently reported to have an oncogenic role in common cancer, however, whether these drugs would affect the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. MethodsA drug-target Mendelian randomization method was adopted to examine the long-term effect of 12 antihypertensive drugs classes on the risk of HCC in Europeans and East Asians. To proxy antihypertensive drugs, we leveraged genetic variants located near or within drug target genes that were associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP). Genetically proxied drugs associated with reduced risk of coronary artery disease were included in primary analysis. Genetic summary statistics of SBP and HCC were derived from publicly available large-scale genome-wide association studies in Europeans and East Asians respectively. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of drugs target genes were used to proxy drugs in a sensitivity analysis. ResultsGenetically proxied thiazides and related diuretics were associated with decreased risk of HCC in both Europeans (OR [95% CI]: 0.79 [0.73, 0.86] per 1 mmHg reduction in SBP; p < 0.001) and East Asians (0.60 [0.45, 0.82]; p = 0.001). Genetically proxied beta-adrenoceptor blockers (BBs) were strongly associated with increased risk of HCC in Europeans (1.46 [1.12, 1.91]; p = 0.004). These findings were replicated in deCODE genetics study and remained consistent when using eQTLs to proxy antihypertensive drugs. ConclusionsOur findings suggested that thiazides diuretics may lower the risk of HCC in both Europeans and East Asians, while BBs may increase the risk of HCC specifically in Europeans. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential of repurposing or retargeting antihypertensive drugs for HCC prevention.

Impact of HPV testing in opportunistic cervical screening: Support for primary HPV screening in the United States	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article; Early Access						cervical cancer prevention; cervical cancer screening; cotesting vs cytology; opportunistic cervical screening; primary HPV screening	POPULATION-BASED EVALUATION; AMERICAN-CANCER-SOCIETY; HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS; INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA; FOLLOW-UP; CYTOLOGY; RISK; WOMEN; DNA; PREVENTION	Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical screening increases diagnosis of precancer and reduces the incidence of cervical cancer more than cytology alone. However, real-world evidence from diverse practice settings is lacking for the United States (U.S.) to support clinician adoption of primary HPV screening. Using a population-based registry, which captures all cervical cytology (with or without HPV testing) and all cervical biopsies, we conducted a real-world evidence study of screening in women aged 30 to 64 years across the entire state of New Mexico. Negative cytology was used to distinguish cotests from reflex HPV tests. A total of 264 198 cervical screening tests (with exclusions based on clinical history) were recorded as the first screening test between 2014 and 2017. Diagnoses of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 or 3 or greater (CIN2+, CIN3+) from 2014 to 2019 were the main outcomes. Of cytology-negative screens, 165 595 (67.1%) were cotests and 4.8% of these led to biopsy within 2 years vs 3.2% in the cytology-only group. Among cytology-negative, HPV tested women, 347 of 398 (87.2%) CIN2+ cases were diagnosed in HPV-positive women, as were 147 of 164 (89.6%) CIN3+ cases. Only 29/921 (3.2%) CIN3+ and 67/1964 (3.4%) CIN2+ cases were diagnosed in HPV-negative, cytology-positive women with biopsies. Under U.S. opportunistic screening, across a diversity of health care delivery practices, and in a population suffering multiple disparities, we show adding HPV testing to cytology substantially increased the yield of CIN2+ and CIN3+. CIN3+ was rarely diagnosed in HPV-negative women with abnormal cytology, supporting U.S. primary HPV-only screening.

The calculated energy-band structures of TbSbTe show two nodal rings on the k(x)-k(y) planes, and the Fermi surface possesses one electron pocket with an enclosure of one hole pocket around the Gamma point. The multiple magnetic phase transitions are induced at critical magnetic fields of H-c(1) approximate to 10.5 kOe, H-c(2) approximate to 20.8 kOe, and H-c(3) approximate to 38.2 kOe at 2 K for the H // ab plane. Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity displays a hump-like feature around 240 K, a general positive slope above T-N = 6 K but a negative slope below T-N. The magnetoresistance exhibits a conversion from the semi-classical H-2 dependence at weak fields to the linear-field dependence at high fields, indicating the presence of a Dirac linear energy dispersion. TbSbTe may provide an ideal platform for studying topological physics and designing devices based on topological quantum materials.

MethodsThis was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Between August 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022, patients with early-stage EC were assessed for enrollment. All patients underwent SLN mapping with ICG or CNPs +/- pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The detection rate (DR), its impact factors, the sensitivity and the negative predictive value (NPV) of SLN mapping were analyzed. ResultsIn total, 206 patients, with 103 per group, were included. The overall and bilateral DRs of the two groups were comparable without significant differences. There was no difference regarding the distribution of mapped SLNs. The sensitivity was 66.7% for both groups, and the NPVs were not significantly different. Furthermore, the sensitivity and NPV reached 100% when calculated either per hemipelvis or only in patients with bilateral SLN detection. ConclusionsSLN mapping by CNPs in EC is feasible with high DRs and diagnostic accuracy compared with ICG. CNPs might be an alternative to ICG for SLN mapping when near-infrared imaging equipment is lacking, especially in stage IA patients.

Precision and Bias of Three Bigmouth Buffalo Aging Structures	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Editorial Material							PECTORAL FIN RAYS; FRESH-WATER FISH; ICTIOBUS-CYPRINELLUS; POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS; AGE-DETERMINATION; LARGEMOUTH BASS; DORSAL SPINES; OTOLITHS; GROWTH; SCALES	The Bigmouth Buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus is a long-lived catostomid with ecological and commercial harvest value. Management of Bigmouth Buffalo relies on accurate age data for population dynamic assessments (recruitment, growth, and mortality), but between-reader precision of nonlethal aging structures compared to otoliths has not been assessed. We analyzed age bias and between-reader precision of ages estimated from pectoral and dorsal fin rays relative to lapillus otoliths for Bigmouth Buffalo (n = 115) captured from shallow natural lakes in Iowa. Maximum agreed age was 21 years for otoliths, 15 years for pectoral fin rays, and 14 years for dorsal fin rays. Ages estimated from pectoral fin rays were the most precise (CV = 12.6%; average percent error [APE] = 8.9%), followed by dorsal fin rays (CV = 16.1%; APE = 11.4%) and otoliths (CV = 21.5%; APE = 16.5%). Pectoral fin rays also had higher exact agreement between readers (37%) and higher agreement within 1 year (77%) compared to dorsal fin rays (35% exact; 69% within 1 year) and lapillus otoliths (17% exact; 61% within 1 year). Both dorsal fin rays and pectoral fin rays underestimated age relative to otoliths, which resulted in younger population age structures and larger mean length-at-age estimates. Our results suggest that biologists can use dorsal and pectoral fin rays as viable nonlethal structures for younger fish (up to 10 years for dorsal fin rays; up to 13 years for pectoral fin rays), whereas otoliths can be difficult to age but are necessary to accurately determine age for older individuals.

Estimation is undertaken using a directional distance function that accounts for the presence of adjustment costs associated with investments in quasi-fixed factors of production. A bootstrap regression is then used to determine the factors affecting dynamic productivity change and its components. Results show that the sample cooperatives experienced a modest decline in productivity over the study period, on average. The analysis of productivity change decompositions suggests that productivity decline is mainly due to the negative contribution of technical inefficiency change. Results further reveal that ignoring adjustment costs when modeling cooperatives' performance leads to distortions in estimates of productivity and its components. The regression analysis results show that years of operation and a higher share of energy products in supply turnover are positively related to productivity change, technical inefficiency change, and scale inefficiency change.

In this work, an integrally formed Janus hydrogel is facilely fabricated in one step by controlling the interfacial distribution of free carboxyl groups on the two sides of hydrogels. At a lower stirring speed, the generated bigger sized emulsion droplets mainly occupy the top surface of hydrogel, which effectively hinders the exposition of carboxyl groups on the top surface, driving them to be more distributed on the bottom surface, ultimately resulting in the poor adhesion of top surface but robust adhesion of bottom surface to various wet tissue even underwater. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two surfaces. In vivo rabbit experiment outcomes clearly validate that the bottom surface of hydrogel firmly adheres to the stomach defect, and the other opposite surface can efficiently address the postoperative adhesion problem. Besides, this hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical toughness and conductivity which has been used as a highly adhesive strain sensor to real-time monitor the beating heart in vivo. This simple yet effective strategy provides a much more feasible approach for creating Janus hydrogels bioadhesives.

Solution processing has several advantages such as low consumption of materials, low-cost processing, and large-area manufacturing. However, use of a solution process entails complications, such as the need for solvent resistivity and solution-processable materials, and yields SOLEDs that have limited luminous efficiency, severe roll-off characteristics, and short lifetime compared to OLEDs fabricated using thermal evaporation. These demerits impede production of practical SOLED displays. This review outlines the industrial demands for commercial SOLEDs and the current status of SOLED development in industries and academia, and presents research guidelines for the development of SOLEDs that have high efficiency, long lifetime, and good processability to achieve commercialization.

Glass-ceramic fibers containing Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped YCa4O(BO3)(3) nanocrystals were fabricated by the molten core method and successive heat treatment. After a careful heat treatment, Nd3+/Yb3+ co-doped YCa4O(BO3)(3) nanocrystals were precipitated in the fiber core. Enhanced broadband near-infrared (NIR) emission from 850 to 1150 nm (bandwidth: similar to 252 nm) was obtained in the glass-ceramic fiber compared to that of precursor fiber. These results suggest that the Nd3+/Yb3+ glass-ceramic fibers are promising for broadband NIR optical amplifications and lasers.

Highly Efficient Quasi 2D Blue Perovskite Electroluminescence Leveraging a Dual Ligand Composition	ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS			English	Article						blue emitter; light-emitting diodes (LEDs); perovskite light-emitting diodes; perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells	LIGHT-EMITTING-DIODES; CATION	Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are advancing because of their superior external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and color purity. Still, additional work is needed for blue PeLEDs to achieve the same benchmarks as the other visible colors. This study demonstrates an extremely efficient blue PeLED with a 488 nm peak emission, a maximum luminance of 8600 cd m(-2), and a maximum EQE of 12.2% by incorporating the double-sided ethane-1,2-diammonium bromide (EDBr2) ligand salt along with the long-chain ligand methylphenylammonium chloride (MeCl). The EDBr2 successfully improves the interaction between 2D perovskite layers by reducing the weak van der Waals interaction and creating a Dion-Jacobson (DJ) structure. Whereas the pristine sample (without EDBr2) is inhibited by small stacking number (n) 2D phases with nonradiative recombination regions that diminish the PeLED performance, adding EDBr2 successfully enables better energy transfer from small n phases to larger n phases. As evidenced by photoluminescence (PL), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization, EDBr2 improves the morphology by reduction of pinholes and passivation of defects, subsequently improving the efficiencies and operational lifetimes of quasi-2D blue PeLEDs.

In this study, a pseudo-targeted metabolomics approach based on scheduled multiple reaction monitoring was developed, and a total of 114 compounds with good linearity, sensitivity, and reproducibility were selected for relative quantification, and the chemical differences between Astragali Radix of different growth patterns were further compared by chemometric analysis. With the help of multivariate and univariate analysis, 26 differential compounds between wild/semi-wild Astragali Radix and cultivated Astragali Radix were determined. Then five marker compounds were screened out by lasso regression, and further verified by systematic clustering, random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression. In addition, malonyl-substituted flavonoids showed relatively higher content in wild/semi-wild Astragali Radix. Thus, the malonyl substitution was characteristic for flavonoids in wild/semi-wild Astragali Radix. In conclusion, the application of pseudo-targeted metabolomics and various statistical methods could offer multi-dimensional information for the holistic quality evaluation of Astragali Radix.

J	Htun, N				Htun, Nay			Holistic and integrated systemic policies and practices for decarbonization	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article; Early Access						decarbonizing; energy efficiency; energy policy; sustinable and resilient development	CLIMATE-CHANGE	A bold, visionary, transforming, systemic, holistic, integrated, caring, inclusive, equitable, sustainable, and resilient paradigm for fast transitions toward a clean energy and decarbonized future is imperative and urgently needed. Business as usual and silo approaches are not viable with the changes that are occurring. These changes are linked and interacting systems of physical, natural, health, social, economic, finance, governance, and institution.The effects and impacts are dire, existential, and pervasive.The 2021 IPCC Report Physical Science Basis: Summary for Policymakers, in clear language stated "it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, oceans and land".The scientific communities in the US, Europe, Asia and other regions all subscribe to this situation.Well documented global empirical evidence is also confirming the profound systems and systemic transformations that are occurring.Business, industry, and the general public, in particular youths, worldwide are all increasingly demanding actions - that transcend words of what needs to be done to deeds of how and now.In the US, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would allocate US 370 billion for combating climate change and clean energy production. The IRA is the largest climate spending package ever.President Biden has called for 100% clean electricity by 2035 and pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50%-52% below 2005 levels by the end of this decade, doubling the previous target.A decarbonized future was endorsed by Leaders at the 2021 G-7 Carbis, UK Summit. There is growing realization that the global climate change crisis requires strengthened and expanded global cooperation with new, innovative and non-bureaucratic mechanisms for collaboration.The 2021 IPCC Report summarized that global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the mid- century under all emissions' scenarios considered. "Global warming of 1.5 and 2 degrees C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades." The UNEP and IEA contends reducing anthropogenic methane emissions will help mitigate climate change and is a cost-effective proposition.The release of methane and micro-organisms from melting of permafrost needs to be better studied and understood., The confluence of increased heat, humidity, fine particulates air pollution, water contaminants and the COVID pandemic, will exacerbate health burdens. This will have serious consequences for human wellbeing, and cascading into national and global security. With climate change, therapeutics and vaccines will not work.The article provides a brief overview of the unprecedented climate related hurricanes, storms, floods and wildfires disasters occurring in all regions of the world. It highlights of some of the key effects, impacts and consequences with current policies and practices with regard to the energy-climate conundrum. There is an imperative to change course toward a decarbonized future.A number of systemic expeditious interventions are delineated.

However, one significant problem is that its residual effluents are detrimental to the surrounding ecosystem. There is a dire need to find an organic, alternative, biodegradable substrate. Vermicompost tea (VCT) was investigated on its suitability as a hydroponic substrate to provide both nutritional and microbiological benefits. It was found VCT increased the biomass of maple peas (Pisum sativum var. arvense L.), increased stem length, raised the potassium ion content, and promoted the uptake of nitrogen by the roots. Meanwhile, the microorganisms associated with earthworm guts were detected in the maple peas root system, namely the inter-rhizosphere of maple peas, including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Flavobacteriaceae. The presence of these microorganisms in large number indicated the ability for VCT to retain earthworm intestinal microbes via intestinal tract movement, excreting, and other vital activities. In addition, Rhizobia spp., such as Burkholderiaceae and Rhizobiaceae were also identified in VCT. They are critical for legumes as they can form root or stem nodule symbioses to produce growth hormone, vitamins, nitrogen fixation, and protection against plant stress. These findings are consistent with our chemical analysis that VCT-treated maple peas had increased nitrate and ammonium nitrogen content relative to the control in roots, stems, and leaves, hence increasing maple peas' biomass. The abundance and species of the inter-root bacterial population were found to change during the experimental period, indicating the importance of microbial balance to the growth and nutrient uptake of maple peas.

In this paper, we suggest the concept of 'co-creative spatiality' to refer to the special sites, relations and processes of human-AI collaboration in artistic creative practice. Our study builds on interviews with 26 Finland-based artists who have used AI in their artistic work. In our analysis, we focus on the questions of what, how, where, who and with of creativity, through which we study the spatialities of creativity and their links to AI. We discuss, how the emerging techno-materialities of AI affect co-creative spatiality by stretching the boundaries of (human) imagination and sparking creativity across new imaginative terrains. Co-creative spatiality reveals novel and unfamiliar collaborations that constitute our material worlds and, therefore, we believe it invites geographical analysis from all those interested in the transformations of creative and artistic practices in the age of AI.

However, recombinant protein excretion is often bottlenecked by cell lysis and plasmid stability. In the present study, recombinant Escherichia coli cell immobilization was performed on a hollow fiber membrane. Tryptone concentration in the expression medium (Super Optimal Broth), which was used as a nitrogen source, was varied between 5 and 20 g L-1 to enhance the excretion of recombinant cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase), plasmid stability, and resistance of cell lysis. RESULTS: The immobilized cells with 5 g L-1 concentration of tryptone improved the plasmid stability with 119% improvement and 69% reduction of cell lysis without remarkably altering the excretion of CGTase compared with the tryptone concentration of 20 g L-1. The immobilized cells showed a 2-fold increase in excretion of CGTase, a 45% reduction in cell lysis, and a 172% gain in plasmid stability in comparison with the free cells. Moreover, the doubling time increased to 58 and 5 h for the immobilized and free cells, respectively. The immobilized cells recorded 2301.62 U mL(-1) of cumulative CGTase activity through seven fermentation cycles using the untreated membrane, marking their excellent reusability. CONCLUSION: This new technique of recombinant protein expression utilizing an immobilized cell system under low tryptone concentration is an outstanding approach to improve recombinant CGTase excretion and plasmid stability with low cell lysis.

J	Miao, Q; Huang, JH; Yin, H				Miao, Qing; Huang, Jinhao; Yin, Hui			How vicarious experiences influence non-compliance with COVID-19 prevention regulations	ANALYSES OF SOCIAL ISSUES AND PUBLIC POLICY			English	Article; Early Access							PUBLIC TRUST; DECISION-MAKING; BROKEN WINDOWS; SELF-EFFICACY; GOVERNMENT; JUSTICE; AUTHORITIES; PERCEPTIONS; IMPULSIVITY; PUNISHMENT	In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have adopted strict regulation strategies such as travel restrictions, gathering restrictions, and daily health reporting. With the normalization of the pandemic, people have shown resistance to these highly intensive regulations. Yet few studies have explored the mechanisms of behavioral change from compliance to non-compliance from the perspective of vicarious experiences. Based on the social cognitive theory, we constructed a model linking vicarious experiences, risk perception, and non-compliance behavior to reveal the mechanism of why individuals do not comply with pandemic prevention rules and regulations. A sample of 1080 Chinese participants was obtained from a time lagged design. The results indicated that vicarious experiences could influence non-compliance with prevention rules and regulations via perceived probability and perceived consequence of being caught. In addition, public trust in the government could negatively moderate the direct effect of the intention of violating prevention rules and regulations on non-compliance. This direct effect is stronger for citizens with low levels of public trust in the government than for those with high levels. Our findings advance the understanding of the mechanisms behind the way vicarious experiences affect citizens' non-compliance behavior with COVID-19 prevention rules and regulations.

Infant externalizing behavior and parent depressive symptoms: Prospective predictors of parental pandemic related distress	INFANCY			English	Article							EMOTIONAL ASSESSMENT; MENTAL-HEALTH; CHILDREN; DISASTER; STRESS	Understanding predictors and effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic is a top-priority in research endeavors. The impact of COVID-19 on all components of family life and mental health cannot be overstated. This study emphasizes the need to investigate predictors of parents' responses to disaster by conceptualizing the depth of the impact of the pandemic using Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Systems Model. We evaluate parents of infants as the center of the microsystem and discuss the importance of parents' responses to the pandemic for children's development. Specifically, utilizing a prospective design involving a sample of 105 infant-mother-father triads, we test the predictive effects of mothers' and fathers' mental health and infant externalizing behavior assessed prior to the pandemic when infants were 16-months on later pandemic related distress (PRD) approximately 1 year later. Results indicate that for both mothers and fathers, more depressive symptoms during their child's infancy predicted more PRD. Although mothers' reports of more child externalizing behavior significantly predicted more PRD, fathers' reports of externalizing were strongly, positively correlated with their concurrent depressive symptoms but not directly related to PRD. We demonstrate the importance of pre-existing mental health and parents' perceptions of their children's behavior as early as 16 months, in coping with disaster.

The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of the MU firing rate and its association with clinical factors in ALS patients using high-density surface electromyography (HDSEMG) and MU decomposition analysis. MethodsNineteen ALS patients and 20 controls prospectively underwent HDSEMG recording of the vastus lateralis muscle during ramp-up (30% of maximum voluntary contraction) and sustained (10% of maximal voluntary contraction for 60 seconds) contractions on performing isometric knee extension. After decomposition analysis, instantaneous firing rates (IFRs) of individually identified MUs were calculated. Comparison of IFRs and clinical variables between ALS patients and controls and analysis of the correlation between individual mean IFR and clinical variables in ALS patients were performed. ResultsThe number of identified MUs was lower in ALS patients than in controls (P = .017). Mean IFRs of MUs (i.e., mean MU firing rates) were higher in ALS patients than in controls at some force levels on ramp-up contraction (P < .05) and at 50 to 60 seconds during sustained contraction (9.1 [ALS] vs 8.3 [controls] pulses per second; P = .036). There was no correlation between the clinical parameters and mean IFR of each patient. DiscussionALS patients had a higher MU firing rate during muscle contraction at a low force level. Noninvasive assessment of the MU firing rate by HDSEMG can detect a motor neuronal hyperexcitable state in ALS patients.

Herein, a symmetry-mismatch-driven interfacial phase transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state is reported. By constructing superlattices using CaRuO3 and SrTiO3, two oxides with different oxygen octahedron networks, the tilting/rotation of oxygen octahedra near interface is tuned dramatically, causing an angle increase from approximate to 150 degrees to approximate to 165 degrees for the Ru-O-Ru bond. This in turn drives the interfacial layer of CaRuO3, approximate to 3 unit cells in thickness, from paramagnetic into ferromagnetic state. The ferromagnetic order is robust, showing the highest Curie temperature of approximate to 120 K and the largest saturation magnetization of approximate to 0.7 mu(B) per formula unit. Density functional theory calculations show that the reduced tilting/rotation of RuO6 octahedra favors an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state. This work demonstrates an effective phase tuning by coupled octahedral rotations, offering a new approach to explore emergent materials with desired functionalities.

Here, two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents, named PT-UCNP-B/G, which can modulate neuronal activities via photostimulation and thermo-stimulation under near-infrared laser irradiation at 980 nm and 808 nm, respectively, are demonstrated. PT-UCNP-B/G emits visible light (410-500 nm or 500-570 nm) through the upconversion process at 980 nm, while they exhibit efficient photothermal effect at 808 nm with no visible emission and tissue damage. Intriguingly, PT-UCNP-B significantly activates extracellular sodium currents in neuro2a cells expressing light-gated channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) ion channels under 980-nm irradiation, and inhibits potassium currents in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the voltage-gated potassium channels (KCNQ1) under 808-nm irradiation in vitro. Furthermore, deep-brain bidirectional modulation of feeding behavior is achieved under tether-free 980 or 808-nm illumination (0.8 W cm(-2)) in mice stereotactically injected with PT-UCNP-B in the ChR2-expressing lateral hypothalamus region. Thus, PT-UCNP-B/G creates new possibility of utilizing both light and heat to modulate neural activities and provides a viable strategy to overcome the limits of optogenetics.

The van der Pauw electrodes configuration is used to determine the electrical resistance. Scanning electron microscope-energy-dispersion X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis is carried out to identify the real amount of conductive elements on a fabric surface as a result of yarns or fabric metallization and to explain the electrical conductivity of the textile materials. The planar electrical anisotropy of electroconductive woven fabrics is observed. The maximum and minimum values of resistances of woven fabric are connected with the weft/warp of which direction coincides with the direction of the longitudinal and transversal axes in the sample plane. SEM-EDS analysis confirms that the electrical conductivity of fabrics depends on the samples elemental composition and the amount of metals deposited on yarns or woven fabrics. It is observed that the sample metallization with thick coating gives a better solution than weaving textiles from coated yarns from the point of view of electrical properties.

The lack of clarity in distinguishing between these two terms has led to biased computations, erroneous interpretations, and misleading recommendations. The problems are highlighted in this paper, taking the example of calculation of Probability of Target Attainment (PTA). This metric is used to propose pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoints required for the interpretation of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the PK/PD index, area under the unbound concentration time curve/minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC), computation of PTA from total plasma concentrations scaled by f(u) ineluctably leads to biased estimates. The bias is greater if the variability associated with f(u) is added, instead of removing it during this scaling. The explanation for the bias is that total plasma drug concentrations are intrinsically more variable than the corresponding free concentrations. This is due to the variability of antimicrobial binding for total, but not for free plasma concentrations. In consequence, the greater variability always leads to underestimation of the PK/PD cutoff (i.e., the critical MIC that is guaranteed for a given percentile of the population). A further consequence is an increase in calculated dosage required to attain the targeted quantile. This erroneous approach, of using free antimicrobial drug fraction, is not limited to the derivation of PK/PD cutoff, but may also have consequences for antimicrobials drug safety in clinical patients.

J	Tranter, B				Tranter, Bruce			Do Australians trust scientists? It depends on the 'science'	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES			English	Article; Early Access						Australia; climate change; genetically modified foods; public health; trust in science	CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE; POLITICIZATION; VIEWS	Trust in science and scientists underlies public support for social and environmental issues, from taking action on climate change to preventing the spread of viruses. Nationally representative Australian survey data show that public trust in university research is higher than that conducted in other institutions. As sources of information, public trust in scientists is considered across potentially polarising and relatively uncontroversial fields of science, with trust varying considerably according to the type of science examined. Public trust is highest in vaccine science and weather forecasting, and lowest for GM crop science, while climate science and forest management fall in between. Social and political background variables are important correlates of trust in science. Younger, tertiary educated, politically progressive Australians are most trusting. Greens party identifiers and environmentalists are more likely than other respondents to trust all types of science examined here-including GM crop science-while institutional trust is positively associated with trust in scientists.

Yakima Basin Integrated Plan-A collaborative partner's perspective	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE			English	Article; Early Access						climate change; collaborative governance; ecosystem resilience; fisheries; habitat; irrigation; restoration; Yakima River Basin		Resilience to climate change is not a process that can be done single-handedly. Centring the focus around building both a climate-resilient system and well-rounded partnerships, the Kittitas Reclamation District (KRD), Washington State, USA, as part of the Yakima River Basin Integrated Water Resource Management Plan (YBIP), has been successful in mitigating water scarcity in the Kittitas Valley and benefitting the larger Yakima River Basin. By using collaborative governance, a decision-making process that breaks down barriers and engages people across the boundaries of public agencies, different levels of government and the public, the KRD has modified its long-term operational goals. The priority is now to establish if a proposed project can provide benefits to other interests and their water needs throughout the Yakima River Basin. We must work together to look at the big picture of a large geographical area in an effort to solve multiple water issues through a single project. As part of YBIP, the goals come to fruition through comprehensive planning for water conservation and the established relationships the partners have with each other. We work together using trust, respect and civility to move towards action and acknowledging that achieving our goals is made possible through collaboration. Opportunities to work together are sought out and taken so that water conservation and other water resiliency projects can be funded and implemented as quickly as possible in an effort to plan for future water scarcity. Protecting the certainty of the water supply for the future of the farms and the ecosystem is of utmost importance.

The 2D mesoporous plate-like Ni-Mn/Al LDHs are successfully prepared via a co-precipitation method. The molar ratio of divalent to trivalent cations is maintained at 3:1 and the pH at 10. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirm that the samples consist of pure LDH phases with a basal spacing of 7.66 to 7.72 angstrom, corresponding to the (003) planes at 2 theta of 11.47(o) and the average crystallite sizes of 4.13 to 8.67 nm. The plate-like Mn-doped Ni-Al LDH consists of many superimposed nanosheets with a size of 9.99 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies confirm the incorporation of Mn2+ into the Ni-Al LDH. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy results indicate that incorporating Mn2+ into LDH enhances its interaction with light. The experimental data from the batch fluoride adsorption studies are subjected to kinetic models such as pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order. The kinetics of fluoride retention on Ni-Mn/Al LDH obey the pseudo-second-order model. The Temkin equation well describes the equilibrium adsorption of fluoride. The results from the thermodynamic studies also indicate that fluoride adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous.

Previously, we screened out a fungicidal lead compound CBUA-TPP (1) through triphenylphosphonium (TPP)-driven mitochondrial-targeting strategy. The targeting led to the rapid accumulation of 1 in mitochondria and the saturation inhibition of complex II in a short time, resulting in electron leakage and the explosion of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the contribution of biphenyl-2-amines to the activity of these compounds and their structure-activity relationship are still unknown. RESULTSTwo series of CBUA-TPP (1) analogues (series 2 and 3) were designed and synthesized. The bioassay results indicated that series 2 compounds generally showed much higher fungicidal activities than series 3, suggesting the crucial contribution of the biarylamine module in these targeted molecules and the pyridinyl substitution of phenyl is unfavorable to their activities. Interestingly, these two series of compounds displayed almost opposite substituent effects. Several compounds showed excellent fungicidal activities in vitro, among which compound 2-1 exhibited excellent field control efficacy on potato late blight. CONCLUSIONBy optimizing the lead compound, the contribution of biarylamine in CBUA-TPP (1) analogs to the fungicidal activity is clarified. Several compounds, represented by 2-1, have great potential as fungicide candidates. They exhibit high and broad-spectrum fungicidal activities and are highly effective against common pathogenic fungi infecting vegetables and fruits both in vitro and field control. It not only provided a new choice for controlling these diseases, but its low resistance tendency also provided a better scheme for resistance management. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

Government Twitter handles are an excellent platform for faster information dissemination and engaging citizens. While most government ministries actively use Twitter, limited attention is given to its modus operandi. Using data retrieved from the official Twitter handle of 'The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare' (MOHFW) of India, the current study examines the effect of the content characteristics, including content type and media type, on citizen engagement measured as tweet likes and retweets. The findings are based on 3742 tweets from MOHFW, recording more than 4.06 million likes and 1.23 million retweets over the initial six months of the largest COVID-19 vaccination drive. Results show that content-sharing guidance for stakeholders gained the maximum engagement, while the latest news about the COVID-19 crisis resulted in the least engagement. Photos gained maximum engagement, while statuses resulted in the least engagement. The results illuminate the textual features of the government's Twitter communication and will enable policymakers to manage their social media content strategy diligently.

Accelerating the replacement from fossil-based solvents to sustainable ecofriendly solvent is desirable for solution-based printed organic electronics. Herein, by simple introducing methyl to the benzene groups of polydiarylfluorene-based polymer, this work realizes the solution processing of blue polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) with a bio-based solvent of limonene toward large-area printed display. Film processed from this solvent exhibits satisfactory morphology and remarkable photophysical performances, even though the polymer chains show more serious aggregation in solution. What's more, devices fabricated with spin-coated films present higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) and better spectra repeatability. Encouraged by the good film-forming ability of this polymer in limonene, this work realizes the fabrication of printed large-area films (5 x 5 cm(2)) with uniform emission and surface morphology by blade coating. Furthermore, this work develops passive matrix (PM) PLEDs arrays with 20 x 20 pixels that can dynamically display monochrome letters and numbers, demonstrating the potential application of cost-effective printing techniques in large-area display.

Design: Population-based prospective cohort study. Setting: Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Population: A cohort of 2502 mother-offspring pairs. Methods: Maternal blood pressure was measured in early, mid and late pregnancy, and information on gestational disorders were obtained from medical records. Offspring cardiac measurements were assessed by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance at 10 years. Main outcome measures: Left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes (LVEDVs and RVEDVs), and ejection fractions, and left ventricular mass (LVM). Results: Offspring exposed to pre-eclampsia had a lower right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (difference, -0.31 SDS; 95% CI -0.60, -0.02); however, no associations with other cardiac outcomes were present. Higher maternal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in early and late pregnancy was associated with lower LVEDVs and RVEDVs (p < 0.05), with the strongest effect in early pregnancy. No associations of systolic blood pressure (SBP) with offspring outcomes were present. These associations persisted after additional adjustment for birth and child factors. Paternal SBP and DBP were not associated with offspring cardiac outcomes. Conclusions: No consistent associations of gestational hypertensive disorder status with childhood cardiac outcomes were present. Higher maternal DBP throughout pregnancy was associated with lower childhood LVEDVs and RVEDVs. Stronger maternal-offspring rather than paternal-offspring associations were present, which may suggest that suboptimal maternal gestational haemodynamic adaptations affects offspring cardiac structure through direct intrauterine effects. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and examine the underlying mechanisms.	[Bongers-Karmaoui, Meddy N.; Wiertsema, Clarissa J.; Jaddoe, Vincent W.

Climatic conditions affect shoot flammability by influencing flammability-related functional traits in nonfire-prone habitats	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						climatic conditions; evolution; functional traits; plant flammability; wildfire	LITTER FLAMMABILITY; PLANT TRAITS; LEAF TRAITS; FIRE; VEGETATION; PATTERNS; DETERMINANTS; TEMPERATURE; PHYLOGENIES; DYNAMICS	center dot Plant flammability is an important driver of wildfires, and flammability itself is determined by several plant functional traits. While many plant traits are influenced by climatic conditions, the interaction between climatic conditions and plant flammability has rarely been investigated. center dot Here, we explored the relationships among climatic conditions, shoot-level flammability components, and flammability-related functional traits for 186 plant species from fire-prone and nonfire-prone habitats. center dot For species originating from nonfire-prone habitats, those from warmer areas tended to have lower shoot moisture content and larger leaves, and had higher shoot flammability with higher ignitibility, combustibility, and sustainability. Plants in wetter areas tended to have lower shoot flammability with lower combustibility and sustainability due to higher shoot moisture contents. In fire-prone habitats, shoot flammability was not significantly related to any climatic factor. center dot Our study suggests that for species originating in nonfire-prone habitats, climatic conditions have influenced plant flammability by shifting flammability-related functional traits, including leaf size and shoot moisture content. Climate does not predict shoot flammability in species from fire-prone habitats; here, fire regimes may have an important role in shaping plant flammability. Understanding these nuances in the determinants of plant flammability is important in an increasingly fire-prone world.

The use of comparatively inexpensive perfluoroalkyl iodides (RfI), mild reaction conditions and a wide range of substituents introduced make this method very attractive for the preparation of imidazobenzazepines with a variety of fluorinated moieties.

Clinical gait analysis provides the opportunity for movement quantification to investigate an observed maladaptive change in gait pattern and offers an objective outcome of change. Pressure-sensor-based technology, inertial and activity monitoring, and instrumented gait analysis (IGA) were employed to define motor abnormalities in Angelman syndrome. Temporal-spatial gait parameters of persons with Angelman Syndrome (pwAS) show deficiencies in gait performance through walking speed, step length, step width, and walk ratio. pwAS walk with reduced step lengths, reduced step widths, and greater variability. Three-dimensional motion kinematics showed increased anterior pelvic tilt, hip flexion, and knee flexion. PwAS have a walk ratio more than two standard deviations below controls. Dynamic electromyography showed prolonged activation of knee extensors, which was associated with a decreased range of motion and the presence of hip flexion contractures. Use of multiple gait tracking modalities revealed that pwAS exhibit a change in gait pattern to a flexed knee gait pattern. Cross-sectional studies of individuals with AS show a regression toward this maladaptive gait pattern over development in pwAS ages 4-11. PwAS unexpectedly did not have spasticity associated with change in gait pattern. Multiple quantitative measures of motor patterning may offer early biomarkers of gait decline consistent with critical periods of intervention, insight into appropriate management strategies, objective primary outcomes, and early indicators of adverse events.

To achieve this, a dynamic model averaging framework is used, considering monthly data over the period 1994:1-2021:3. Our results suggest that the convenience yield, the global economic activity index, and the government bond yields act as the main factors that exercise a persistent and significant impact, for the largest part of the study period, although at different magnitude. More importantly, though, we show that at different time periods there are additional factors that exercise a significant impact on the oil price differential, such as refining constraints, stock market volatility, trading volume, and geopolitical risk. Thus, unless a dynamic modeling framework is employed, the full spectrum of the related effects cannot be revealed. A series of tests confirm the robustness of our findings. Several policy implications of these results are also discussed.

Advanced catalysts boosting CO2RR with high activity, selectivity, and durability at low overpotentials are of great importance but still elusive. Here, we report that the ultrathin Pd-Ag dendritic nanoplates (PdAg DNPs) exhibited boosted activity, selectivity, and stability for producing formate from CO2 at a very low overpotential in aqueous solutions under ambient conditions. As a result, the PdAg DNPs exhibited a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate of 91% and a cathodic energy efficiency (EE) of similar to 90% at the potential of -0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), showing significantly enhanced durability as compared with pure Pd catalysts. Our strategy represents a rational catalyst design by engineering the surface geometrical and electronic structures of metal nanocrystals and may find more applicability in future electrocatalysis.

To overcome these borderline situations, portable and easy-to-use screening devices are needed for the non-expert public and confirmed by medical personnel/physicians who can quickly guide/prescribe antibiotic treatments. In such a context, nanotechnologies are very promising and useful tools due to the remarkable optical, chemical and physical properties of biocompatible nanomaterials deposited or synthesized on traditional solid electrodes that greatly improve the detection limit and the selectivity of nanostructured-based biosensors. With this in mind, this review summarizes the latest advances in the bioelectrochemical detection of E. coli and its related products using different biosensor configurations in saline buffers and spiked real samples, namely food products (milk, fruits, vegetables), body fluids (blood, urine, swine feces) and river water.

The doping effect of Ce on the catalyst for selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 was investigated. Compared to Cobalt-chromium oxide catalyst, the doping of Ce improved the catalytic activity and water and sulfur resistance of the catalyst. The doping of Ce significantly changed the surface morphology, reduced the crystallinity and increased the specific surface area of the catalyst. The large specific surface area of the catalyst facilitated the high dispersion of the acidic sites and promoted the adsorption and desorption of NH3. The doping of Ce increased the chemisorbed oxygen content and the number of acidic sites, enhancing the SCR activity of the catalyst. In addition, the doping of Ce increased the percentage of Co3+ and changed the ionic state of Cr, promoting the interaction between metal ions.

The proposed resonator has the characteristics of the band-pass filters, suppressing the out-of band signals. It is illustrated the proposed resonator has a simple circuit topology without sacrificing the performances of the DBPA. To verify the methodology, a high efficiency DBPA prototype operating at 1.72 and 3.48 GHz is fabricated and measured. The DBPA obtains a bandwidth of 100 and 50 MHz at the low and high frequency bands, respectively. The measurement results show that the DBPA delivers a saturation power of 43.1 and 40.8 dBm at 1.72 and 3.48 GHz, respectively. The measured drain efficiencies of the DBPA are 75.4% and 68.6% at 1.72 and 3.48 GHz, respectively. Meanwhile, when the DBPA is stimulated by a 20 MHz LTE signal with a peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of 7 dB, the measured adjacent channel leakage ratios are lower than -50 dBc at both 1.72 and 3.48 GHz after digital predistortion.

However, the obvious structural degradation such as the layered-to-spinel transformation, associating with deteriorated electrochemical cycle stability, hinder their extensive applications in batteries. Herein, a composite structure is designed based on a Mn-based oxide of LiMn0.8Ni0.2O2 with a high-voltage spinel crystal domain pre-introduced into the parent layered structure, showing good structural stability during electrochemical process. Results show that Li2MnO3 crystal domain suffers from sluggish Li+ ions kinetics and structural transformation from layered to metastable spinel, while the pre-introduced high-voltage spinel crystal domain exhibits almost maintained structure, and the optimal performance near to theoretical capacity of LiMn0.8Ni0.2O2 cathode can be harvested after electrochemical activation. This design is useful for stabilizing the entire structure prior to the degradation of the parent structures, and the electrochemical contributions of layered Li2MnO3 and pre-introduced high-voltage spinel crystal domains are also discerned. This study provides new guidelines for designing high-performance composite-structure Mn-based cathode materials by pre-introduction of stable crystal domains.

In this study, we show that GSNOR deficiency in tumors is associated with poor prognostic histopathological features and poor survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). GSNOR-low tumors were characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment with exclusion of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. Notably, GSNOR-low tumors exhibited an immune evasive proteomic signature along with an altered energy metabolism characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and energetic dependence on glycolytic activity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated generation of GSNOR gene knockout (KO) CRC cells confirmed in vitro and in vivo that GSNOR-deficiency conferred higher tumorigenic and tumor-initiating capacities. Moreover, GSNOR-KO cells possessed enhanced immune evasive properties and resistance to immunotherapy, as revealed following xenografting them into humanized mouse models. Importantly, GSNOR-KO cells were characterized by a metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis to produce energy, as indicated by increased lactate secretion, higher sensitivity to 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), and a fragmented mitochondrial network. Real-time metabolic analysis revealed that GSNOR-KO cells operated close to their maximal glycolytic rate, as a compensation for lower OXPHOS levels, explaining their higher sensitivity to 2DG. Remarkably, this higher susceptibility to glycolysis inhibition with 2DG was validated in patient-derived xenografts and organoids from clinical GSNOR-low tumors. In conclusion, our data support the idea that metabolic reprogramming induced by GSNOR deficiency is an important mechanism for tumor progression and immune evasion in CRC and that the metabolic vulnerabilities associated with the deficiency of this denitrosylase can be exploited therapeutically.

This study reports the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile-type TiO2 and H-Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ into the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as Li-6 solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.	[Michaely, Anna; Janka, Oliver; Giesselmann, Elias C.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between normal range uACR and the prevalence of hypertension. MethodsThe research used data from the 2009 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which included 14,919 participants. We defined the uACR as the amount of albumin (mg/dL) divided by creatinine (g/dL) in randomly voided urine. Hypertension was defined as mean systolic blood pressure >= 130 mmHg, or diastolic >= 80 mmHg, or were taking hypertension medication or were informed of a hypertension diagnosis by a physician/health professional. ResultsIn multivariable-adjusted models, per 5 mg/g uACR increment, the hypertension prevalence increased 1.31-fold (OR, 1.31; 95% CI 1.23-1.40), the odds [95% confidence interval (CI)] for hypertension prevalence were 2.25 (1.86-2.72) for those in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. The nonlinear relationship between hypertension prevalence and uACR was found by visually assessing images (p for nonlinearity<.001). In addition, in the subgroup analysis stratified by body mass index, the lower the BMI, the stronger the association between uACR and hypertension prevalence. ConclusionsEven within the normal range, subtly elevated uACR was associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension in the USA general population, and this association may be enhanced in individuals with low BMI. Further research is needed to assess the clinical applicability of these findings.

Catalyst-/Additive-Free One-Pot Synthesis of Oxazolidines in Water via Regioselective and Stereoselective C-H Functionalization Approach	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						Catalyst-free; oxazolidines; tert-amine; C-H functionalization; one-pot synthesis	ORGANIC-SYNTHESIS; BOND; DERIVATIVES; LIQUID; AMINES	A catalyst-free approach for the synthesis of oxazolidine derivatives is developed here. Though the synthesized oxazolidines contain three stereogenic centers, single diastereomer of the product is obtained. Single crystal X-ray analysis of the product confirmed the stereochemistry. The reaction is performed by taking tetrahydroisoquinoline/cyclic benzylic amine (1 equivalent) and aromatic aldehyde (2 equivalent) in water under refluxing condition which produces excellent yield (87-96 %). With pyrrolidine as amine substrate, the reaction gives alpha,beta-unsaturated cyclic imines which is an example of beta-C-H functionalization of secondary amine. The proposed mechanism shows that the reaction proceeds through the formation of azomethine ylide which undergoes [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction providing the oxazolidine product.

J	Rather, IA; Kumar, G; Saha, R				Rather, Irfan Ahmad; Kumar, Gulshan; Saha, Rahul			Improved aquila optimization-based parameter evaluation framework and meta-heuristic algorithm in radio-over-fiber SpatialMux multi-input multi-output long-term evolution system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Aquila optimization; error vector magnitude; MIMO system; QAM modulation and spatial multiplexing; QPSK modulation; radio-over-fiber	MIMO	In heterogeneous access network, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radio-over-fiber (RoF) system is an efficient approach for multiple signal transmission with low cost and complexity. The performance of RoF fronthaul system in MIMO system will be varied with different nonlinear effects. By adjusting various transmission parameters, such as the input signal power or the laser bias current, the nonlinear impacts produced by the RoF system can be reduced. In this paper, a novel algorithm Improved Aquila Optimization (IAO) is proposed to optimize transmission circumstances of MIMO RoF system. It determines the appropriate bias current for both lasers and Radio Frequency (RF) signal power in a short period. The input signals are wavelength multiplexed with Intensity Modulation and Direct Detection (IM/DD) applied. The carrier as well as transmission frequency is governed by the MIMO-Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard. The proposed system is implemented in MATLAB, and the performance is evaluated. The experimental results show that fast convergence and trade-off between noise and nonlinearity are obtained with varying bandwidth. In the experimental scenario, the maximum Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of 1.88, 3.14 and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0.134, 3.146 were attained for both quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). For 100 iterations, the processing time was reduced to 0.137 s. When compared with the conventional state-of-the-art approaches, the accuracy and computational complexity of the proposed approach are improved.

The template free material was obtained by calcination and the channels of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) were successfully loaded with cerium (corrosion inhibitor). This cerium loaded material was modified with N-1-(3-Trimethoxysilylpropyl)diethylenetriamine through grafting with surface hydroxyl group. Subsequently, the surface-modified material was actively used as a curing agent, host for corrosion inhibitors and filler as well in epoxy-based coatings for mild steel. The mesoporous silica material was characterized by using a combination of various analytic and spectroscopic techniques like FT-IR, powder-XRD, N-2 sorption, solid state Si-29 and C-13 MAS NMR studies. The physicochemical, physicomechanical, and thermal properties of the hybrid film were analyzed through standard techniques like FT-IR, TGA-DTA, DMTA and FE-SEM. The coated hybrid film on mild steel was tested for corrosion inhibition by using potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The aforementioned studies revealed the developed coating system exhibited promising corrosion protection performance which was evident from i(corr) (6.65 nA), E-corr (-502.850 mV), impedance (1.2x10(6) omega) and phase angle (>80 degrees). The observed water contact angle (WCA)>90 degrees suggesting the hydrophobic nature of the coated surface.

Traditionally, WM has been treated with chemoimmunotherapy. Recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in WM, both as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs. There is emerging evidence on use of other agents including BCL2 inhibitors and on treatment of rare presentations of WM. In this update, the Medical and Scientific Advisory Group of Myeloma Australia review the available evidence on the treatment of WM since the last publication in 2017 and provide specific recommendations to assist Australian clinicians in the management of this disease.

In this work, the capture of CO2 by 3N-M-VG (3N doped mono-vacancy graphene) nanosheets in the electric field of 0.000-0.040 a. u. were investigated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The interaction between CO2 and 3N-M-VG increased with increasing applied electric field and the adsorption of CO2 by 3N-M-VG underwent a transition from physical to chemisorption at electric field strengths of 0.020-0.030 a. u. In addition, the material allows the capture and release of CO2 by switching on and off an applied electric field. CO2 adsorption and selectivity of 3N-M-VG in CH4/H-2/CO2 gas mixtures can be greatly improved by applying an electric field. Theoretical results of this study can provide guidance for the design of highly selective CO2 capture materials.

J	Brown, K; Lam, CK; Binks, M				Brown, Kiarna; Lam, Chor Kiu (Maree); Binks, Michael			Short cervix and preterm birth in the top end	AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						cervical cerclage; cervical length measurement; preterm birth; progesterone; Northern Territory; ultrasound		BackgroundReducing rates of preterm birth (PTB) remains a significant challenge. The Northern Territory (NT) records some of the highest rates of PTB in the country, especially in First Nations women. In 2014, a Western Australian (WA) preterm birth prevention initiative involved the implementation of seven key initiatives. One of these was routine mid-trimester cervical length measurement. The initiative successfully reduced PTB rates following its first year of implementation. This was the first successful reduction in PTB, including the earlier gestational ages, across a population. AimsTo assess the uptake of routine cervical length measurement in the Top End of the NT after the success of the WA PTB prevention initiative and assess if treatment of a short cervix improved PTB rates. MethodsA retrospective cohort study of all women who received antenatal care and delivered their baby at the NT's only tertiary hospital was performed. Mid-trimester ultrasound scan data were collected from two separate time windows, before and after the implementation of the WA intervention. Treatments and gestational age at birth were recorded. ResultsAdoption of routine screening of cervical length measurement at mid-trimester ultrasound in the NT was successful, increasing from 4 to 88%. Detection rates of short cervix doubled. However, there was no difference to PTB rates despite targeted management. ConclusionPTB remains a significant challenge in the NT, especially for First Nations women who are found to have a short cervix more commonly than non-Indigenous women in the Top End.

Setting-based prevention at the workplace can reduce the UV exposure of outdoor workers through appropriate technical or organizational measures. We explored the implementation of setting-based UV protection at the workplace in Germany from the perspective of outdoor workers. MethodsA Germany-wide sample of 319 outdoor workers from different employment sectors (64.3% male) was surveyed via telephone on different technical and organizational measures for UV protection at the workplace. Bivariate analyses were performed to explore associations with job-related characteristics. ResultsIn general, 28.0% were rarely or never provided with a place in the shade during working hours, and 27.4% rarely or never provided with a shaded place during breaks. One-third had rarely or never the opportunity to work in the shade on hot summer days. Overall, 51.9% reported receiving protective clothing from their employer, 45.5% were provided with headgear, and 25.1% with sunscreen. About one-third had often or always the option of starting work earlier in the morning on hot summer days to work less in the sun, while 18.6% had to work overtime on such days. One-third (35.4%) had been educated at work about risks of solar radiation and sun protection measures. ConclusionsOur study is among the first to present findings on the implementation of different setting-based UV protection measures at the workplace and provides starting points for employers and policy makers to improve UV protection at the workplace.

J	Grundy, PR; Spargo, G				Grundy, Paul R.; Spargo, Gail			Bt cotton and modern insecticide adoption decreases <i>Helicoverpa</i> spp. population recruitment in a subtropical cropping system	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						area-wide management; IPM; pupae; resistance management	ARMIGERA LEPIDOPTERA-NOCTUIDAE; CENTRAL QUEENSLAND; RESISTANCE; CROPS; MANAGEMENT; IPM; ABUNDANCE; HUBNER; CHLORANTRANILIPROLE; SUPPRESSION	Extensive crop sampling for Helicoverpa spp. pupae was undertaken (2017-2021) to provide insights as to how pest population dynamics have altered in a subtropical cropping system following the introduction of transgenic Bt cotton and newer generation insecticides for pulse production. Previously (1996-1999), a pattern of year-round population cycling and build-up was identified to occur between summer cotton (non-Bt) and winter chickpea, enabled by widespread resistance to broad-spectrum insecticides used at the time. Current pupae sampling was unable to recover pupae from Bt cotton, suggesting this crop had become a population sink rather than a source for Helicoverpa spp. Pupae were less abundant in pulses, with monthly counts varying from 0 to 3192/ha in chickpea being a fraction of previous densities that ranged from 10,000 to 100,000/ha whilst pupae were not detected in mungbean crops. Poor survival (0%-39.5%) of pupae collected from chickpea, likely due to sub-lethal insecticide exposure during the larval stage, further limited population recruitment. The highest densities of pupae (up to 18,666/ha) were routinely recovered from unsprayed pigeon pea grown as refuges for Bt cotton resistance management, although Tachinid spp. parasitoids caused increasing pupal mortality with refuge age. This study suggests that the high control efficacy afforded by transgenic Bt traits incorporated into cotton and newer insecticides used on pulse crops has provided a form of area-wide management that may explain suppression of Helicoverpa spp. pupae densities compared to levels previously recorded across the cropping system.

It has been recognized that various elements of the reaction system, including catalysts, intermediates, and products, will undergo real-time variations during the reaction process, which are of significant meaning to the in-depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, material structure, and active sites. As judicious tools for real-time monitoring of the changes in these complex elements, in situ techniques have been exposed to the spotlight in recent years. This review aims to highlight significant progress of various advanced in situ characterization techniques, such as in situ X-ray based technologies, in situ spectrum technologies, and in situ scanning probe technologies, that enhance our understanding of heterogeneous electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. We provide a summary of recent advances in the development and applications of these in situ characterization techniques, from the working principle and detection modes to detailed applications in different reactions, along with key questions that need to be addressed. Finally, in view of the unique application and limitation of different in situ characterization techniques, we conclude by putting forward some insights and perspectives on the development direction and emerging combinations in the future.

Outcomes of Investigating T Wave Inversion With Echocardiography in an Unselected Young Male Preparticipation Cohort	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article						cardiomyopathy; electrocardiography; preparticipation screening; T wave inversion	SUDDEN-DEATH; ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC ABNORMALITIES; FORCES ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; ATHLETES HEART; PREVALENCE; POPULATION; DIAGNOSIS; EXERCISE; SOCIETY; ADULTS	BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography (ECG) may be performed as part of preparticipation sports screening. Recommendations on screening of athletes to identify individuals with previously unrecognized cardiac disease are robust; however, data guiding the preparticipation screening of unselected populations are scarce. T wave inversion ( TWI) on ECG may suggest an undiagnosed cardiomyopathy. This study aims to describe the prevalence of abnormal TWI in an unselected young male cohort and the outcomes of an echocardiography-guided approach to investigating these individuals for structural heart diseases, focusing on the yield for cardiomyopathies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive young male individuals undergoing a national preparticipation cardiac screening program for 39 months were studied. All underwent resting supine 12-lead ECG. Those manifesting abnormal TWI, defined as negatively deflected T waves of at least 0.1 mV amplitude in any 2 contiguous leads, underwent echocardiography. A total of 69 714 male individuals with a mean age of 17.9 +/- 1.1 years were studied. Of the individuals, 562 (0.8%) displayed abnormal TWI. This was most frequently observed in the anterior territory and least so in the lateral territory. A total of 12 individuals (2.1%) were diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy diagnoses were significantly associated with deeper maximum TWI depth and the presence of abnormal TWI in the lateral territory, but not with abnormal TWI in the anterior and inferior territories. No individual presenting with TWI restricted to solely leads V-1 to V-2, 2 inferior leads or both was diagnosed with a cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiomyopathy diagnoses were more strongly associated with certain patterns of abnormal TWI. Our findings may support decisions to prioritize echocardiography in these individuals.

Online and onsite supervised exercise therapy and education for individuals with knee osteoarthritis - A before and after comparison of two different care delivery models	MUSCULOSKELETAL CARE			English	Article						exercise; knee; online; osteoarthritis; rehabilitation	PERFORMANCE-BASED TESTS; HIP; COVID-19; TELEHEALTH; OUTCOMES	Objective: To compare the 3 and 12-month changes on pain, function and quality of life between online and onsite delivery of Good Life with Osteoarthritis in Denmark (GLA:D-(R)) in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Design: Non-inferior comparison of individuals with knee OA receiving physiotherapist-supervised online (TeleGLA:D) or onsite (GLA:D-(R)) (12 exercise and 2 education sessions). The primary outcome was the baseline-to-3- month change on KOOS-12 summary score. Secondary outcomes were changes in KOOS-12 subscales pain, function and quality of life and pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale (VAS 0-100)) at 3 and 12 months; 40 m fast-paced walk and 30 s chair-stand at 3 months. Using mixed linear regressions, comparisons were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, comorbidities and number of knees and hips with OA. Results: Over a 1-year period (May 2020-May 2021), we included data from 3789 participants (3701 GLA:D-(R); 88 TeleGLA:D). At 3 months, TeleGLA:D showed noninferior change-scores to GLA:D-(R) on KOOS-12 summary score; adjusted mean difference (90% Confidence Intervals (CI)) -2.40 (-5.55 to 0.75). For secondary outcomes, there was a statistically significant difference in change-scores, favouring TeleGLA:D in gait speed; adjusted mean difference (90%CI) 0.23 m/s (0.18-0.27). TeleGLA:D remained non-inferior to GLA:D-(R) at 12 months. Conclusions: Online delivery of physiotherapist-supervised neuromuscular exercise and education for individuals with knee OA may be non-inferior to traditional onsite delivery in reducing pain and improving function and quality of life. The wide confidence intervals, baseline imbalance, loss to follow-up and the non-randomized design highlight the need for a confirmatory randomized controlled trial.

Investors with high inaction are likely to underperform in the future. Our results show a similar underperformance for stocks with a high non-trading level of institutional investors. We investigate several behavioral biases as potential drivers of the non-trades and find no evidence of distraction, overconfidence, and disposition effects. Institutional investors' tendency to sell stocks with salient price movements and recency bias best explains their inactions. Overall, the non-trading behavior of institutional investors serves as a unique predictor for their future performance and potential behavioral biases are driving this predictability.

However, the existing clinical patches are still limited in effective uterus recovery, resulting in low pregnancy and live birth rates. Herein, a novel engineered, and biocompatible Janus collagen patch (JCOP) is developed to achieve excellent uterine defect recovery and increase effective live births. The JCOP can highly match the structure, micromorphology, and mechanical properties of a natural uterus due to homologous-like tissue homogeneity. JCOP's rough surface and loose-extracellular-matrix-like porosity promote fibroblast adhesion and tissue regeneration, whereas its smooth surface reduces fibroblast adhesion and prevents visceral adhesions. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional resistance to swelling and deformation along with stable mechanical strength for long-term preservation in the body and can withstand the highest uterine pressure in a humid interior environment attributed to its superior structural layout. Moreover, JCOP@bF, a functional JCOP linked to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) via a specific collagen-binding domain, significantly promotes repair of the injured uterus, restores the ability of the endometrium to accept embryos, and supports their development to a viable stage in a rat model of uterine damage. This study shows great promise for treating infertility caused by uterine damage.

The clinicopathologic significance of<i> NPM1</i> mutation and ability to detect mutated NPM1 by immunohistochemistry in non-AML myeloid neoplasms	GENES CHROMOSOMES & CANCER			English	Article; Early Access						non-AML myeloid neoplasm; NPM1 immunohistochemistry; NPM1 mutation	HEALTH-ORGANIZATION CLASSIFICATION; MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES; 2016 REVISION; NUCLEOPHOSMIN; LEUKEMIA; PROGRESSION; PROTEIN; MDS	NPM1 mutated non-AML myeloid neoplasms (MN; <20% blasts) are characterized by an aggressive clinical course in a few studies. In this retrospective study, we evaluate the clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of non-AML MN patients with NPM1 mutations. We assessed NPM1 mutation by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). Cytoplasmic NPM1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed, formic acid-decalcified bone marrow biopsy specimens. We evaluated 34 non-AML MN patients with NPM1 mutations comprising MDS (22), MPN (3) and MDS/MPN (9). They commonly presented with anemia (88%), thrombocytopenia (58%) and leukopenia (50%). Bone marrow dysplasia was common (79%). The karyotype was often normal (64%). NGS for MN-associated mutations performed in a subset of the patients showed a median of 3 mutations. NPM1 mutations were more often missense (c.859C > T p. L287F; 65%) than frameshift insertion/duplication (35%) with median variant allele frequency (VAF; 9.7%, range 5.1%-49.8%). Mutated NPM1 by IHC showed cytoplasmic positivity in 48% and positivity was associated with higher VAF. The median overall survival (OS) in this cohort was 70 months. Nine patients (26%) progressed to AML. OS in patients who progressed to AML was significantly shorter than the one of patients without progression to AML (OS 20 vs. 128 months, respectively, log rank p = 0.05). NPM1 mutated non-AML MN patients commonly had cytopenias, dysplasia, normal karyotype, mutations in multiple genes, and an unfavorable clinical outcome, including progression to AML. Our data demonstrated that IHC for NPM1 can be a useful supplementary tool to predict NPM1 mutation in some non-AML MN; however, genetic testing cannot be replaced by IHC assessment.

We examined the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial and its observational follow-up study (ACCORDION) to investigate the effect of intensive glucose control on multiple events and further identify any subgroup effects.Materials and Methods: A recurrent events analysis, using a negative binomial regression model, was applied to estimate the treatment effect on different consecutive cardiovascular disease events, including non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalisation from heart failure, and cardiovascular death. Interaction terms were used to identify potential effect modifiers. The robustness of the results was confirmed in sensitivity analyses using alternative models.Results: The median duration of follow-up was 7.7 years. Of the 5128 participants in the intensive and 5123 in the standard glucose control arm, respectively, 822 (16.0%) and 840 (16.4%) participants experienced a single event; 189 (3.7%) and 214 (4.2%) participants experienced two events; 52 (1.0%) and 40 (0.8%) experienced three events; and 1 (0.02%) and 1 (0.02%) experienced four events. There was no evidence of a treatment effect, with a rate difference of 0.0 (-0.3, 0.3) per 100 person-years comparing intensive versus standard intervention, although with non-significantly lower event rates in younger patients with HbA1c < 7% and higher event rates in older patients with HbA1c = 9%.Discussion: Intensive glucose control may not affect cardiovascular disease progression except in select subgroups. Since time-to-first event analysis may miss beneficial or harmful effects of glucose control on the risk of cardiovascular disease, recurrent events analysis should be routinely analysed in cardiovascular outcome trials, particularly when investigating long-term treatment effects.

The experimental results show that the addition of Nd2O3 allows complete sintering densification of the MAS at lower temperatures, and appropriate addition ratios increase the crystallinity, promote the formation of Indialite, improve the MAS microstructure, reduce the coefficient of thermal expansion, and optimize the dielectric properties. Ultimately, the best performance is achieved by adding 4 wt% Nd2O3 to the MAS sample and sintering at 1255 degrees C for 15 min.

Anthocyanins function as screens to protect photosynthetic tissues from photoinhibition. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis and spatial accumulation pattern of anthocyanins remain some unresolved issues. Here, we demonstrate that the GARP-type transcription factor GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 (GLK1) functions as a positive factor in anthocyanin accumulation. GLK1 enhances the transcriptional activation activities of MYB75, MYB90, and MYB113 via direct protein-protein interactions to increase the expression of anthocyanin-specific biosynthetic genes. Anthocyanins accumulate in an acropetal manner in Arabidopsis. We also found that the expression pattern of GLK1 overall mimicked the accumulation pattern of anthocyanin from the base of the main stem to the shoot apex. Based on these findings, we established a working model for the role of GLK1 in anthocyanin accumulation and propose that GLK1 mediates the spatial distribution pattern of anthocyanins by affecting the transcriptional activation activities of MYB75, MYB90, and MYB113.

Expanding the boundaries of previously obtained informed consent in research: Views from participants in the Personalised Risk-based Mammascreening study	HEALTH EXPECTATIONS			English	Article						cancer screening; focus groups; informed consent; personal autonomy; qualitative research	BROAD CONSENT; INCIDENTAL FINDINGS; PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS; BIOBANK RESEARCH	IntroductionUnderstanding participants' concerns and information needs regarding broadened consent is crucial to ensure transparency and participant autonomy. Our study qualitatively examined these issues in women participating in the Personalized RISk-based MAmmascreening study (PRISMA). The original PRISMA informed consent was project-specific (i.e., breast cancer research), limiting the scope of secondary research. We explored participants' needs for broadened consent to preserve informed decision-making while maximising the potential re-use of data. MethodsFocus groups (FGs) were performed following a semistructured discussion guide. Two independent researchers analysed the data thematically using an inductive approach. FindingsTwenty-three asymptomatic women and 13 women diagnosed with breast cancer were randomly divided into six FGs. Four superordinate themes were identified: (1) Normalization, (2) Attitude towards the pharmaceutical industry, (3) Privacy and (4) Knowledge. Our participants viewed data sharing as an important conduit for advancing medical science. Perceived integrity was more often attributed to noncommercial than commercial parties, with a marked mistrust towards the pharmaceutical industry. Most requested information needs related to data protection. Participants' ideal consent process would confer a range of options; for example, they would be able to choose with whom data can be shared, whether data will be de-identified or anonymous, the expiration date of their consent and how, if requested, general and personal study results would be disclosed. ConclusionOur participants expressed clear information needs and a strong desire to be actively engaged in future data sharing decisions. Given that many researchers collaborate with commercial parties, building public confidence in these institutions would be beneficial. Illustrative examples addressing privacy concerns and clarifying difficult terms would aid consent decision-making. Although our participants displayed great altruism in sharing their data and accepted that broad consent would ultimately facilitate future research, broad consent did not reflect their ideal situation. Dynamic consent may be an option but warrants further feasibility research. Patient and Public ContributionWomen were recruited from the general breast cancer screening population. Their perceptions and information needs, as reported in this study, will not only inform broadened consent for PRISMA but ideally guide other consent templates and decisions regarding consent processes.

Methods: A total of 120 subjects with untreated Stage II/III periodontitis participated in this study. At baseline, questionnaires were administered to assess the following lifestyle behaviours: adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD), physical activity (PA) and stress levels, sleep quality, smoking and alcohol use. Participants received Steps 1/2 of periodontal therapy and were re-evaluated after 3 months. A composite outcome of the endpoint of therapy (i.e., no sites with probing pocket depth [PPD] >= 4 mm with bleeding on probing, and no sites with PPD >= 6 mm) was regarded as the primary outcome. Simple and multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between lifestyle behaviours and clinical periodontal outcomes. Disease severity at baseline, body mass index, diabetes, household disposable income and plaque control were considered as confounders. Results: Multiple regression analyses showed significantly lower odds of achieving the endpoint of therapy in subjects with poor sleep quality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.47; p <.01), smoking (OR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.06-0.52; p <.05) and alcohol use above the suggested intake (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.07-0.63; p <.01). Subjects with a combination of `unhealthy lifestyles' (low adherence to MD and low PA levels and high levels of stress and poor sleep quality) showed higher proportions of residual PPD >= 6 mm (MD = 1.51; 95% CI: 0.23-2.80; p <.05) and lower odds of achieving the endpoint of therapy (OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.33-0.99; p <.05) at re-evaluation. Conclusions: Subjects with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours showed worse clinical outcomes 3 months after Steps 1/2 of periodontal therapy.

Here, we describe the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of decarboxylated osteocalcin under acidic conditions. Decarboxylated osteocalcin at pH 2.0 retains the alpha-helix structure of native osteocalcin with three gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues at neutral pH. This implies that decarboxylated osteocalcin is stable under an acidic environment in bone. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Glu17 and Glu21 are important for the adiponectin-inducing activity of decarboxylated osteocalcin. These findings suggest that the receptor of decarboxylated osteocalcin responds to the negative charge in helix 1 of osteocalcin.

Methods: A cohort of 5093 participants aged >= 65 years (not disabled or institutionalized), completed the baseline survey in April 2013. Functional outcomes and mortality served as follow-up data from April 2013 to March 2018. However, the data did not include events, such as certified cases for long-term care and death for 12 months from the start of follow-up. We collated data on the use of the annual health check system in 2012 and frailty checkups using the postal Kihon Checklist in 2013. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the association between participation in the check-ups, and functional outcomes and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Long-term care and mortality risks were significantly lower among those aged <75 years who used health screening than among those who did not, despite adjusting for confounding factors (hazard ratios: 2.1-3.5). In those aged >= 75 years, the risk for long-term care was lower in individuals participating in both health and frailty check-ups and in those who participated in the frailty check-ups only, than in those who did not participate. Conclusions: The association between participation in health and frailty check-ups and adverse health outcomes differed among the age groups, indicating the potential benefit of health and frailty check-ups in older adults.

Changes in serum chloride (Cl) are commonly perceived as 'just' parallel to changes in serum sodium, however, are less well-studied in the context of cirrhosis. Aims: To investigate whether serum chloride independently predicts outcomes in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD) and stable clinical course or with critical illness. Methods: In total, 891 patients with ACLD (defined by hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] >= 6 mm Hg) were followed after HVPG measurement between 2003 and 2020 (ACLD-cohort). In total, 181 critically ill patients with cirrhosis admitted to the ICU between 2004 and 2007 were recruited for the ICU-cohort. Hypo-/hypernatremia (normal: 136-145 mmol/L) and hypo-/hyperchloremia (normal: 98-107 mmol/L) at baseline were assessed. Results: ACLD-cohort: 68% of male patients with a median MELD (adjusted for Na) of 11 (9-17) were included (Child-Pugh-stages-A/B/C: 46%/38%/16%) and followed for a median of 60 months. Lower serum chloride (adjusted average HR per mmol/L: 0.965 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.945- -0.986], p = 0.001) showed a significant association with hepatic decompensation/liver-related mortality on multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, HVPG, albumin and MELD. In line, hypochloremia was significantly associated with hepatic decompensation/liver-related mortality (adjusted average HR: 1.656 [95% CI:1.267-2.163], p < 0.001). ICU-cohort: 70% of patients were male, median MELD was 31(22-39) at ICU admission (92% with Child-Pugh-stage-C). After adjusting for hypo-/hypernatremia,MELD, and blood pH, hypochloremia remained independently associated with ICU-mortality (aOR Cl: 3.200 [95%CI: 1.209-8.829], p = 0.021). Conclusion: Hypochloremia is associated with increased mortality in clinically stable and critically ill patients with cirrhosis independently of MELD including serum sodium. ICU-cohort: 70% of patients were male, median MELD was 31(22-39) at ICU admission (92% with Child-Pugh-stage-C).

J	Seney, V; Safford, J				Seney, Valerie; Safford, Jacqueline			Year one review: Staff perception on the implementation of the chair restraint on an adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit	JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRIC NURSING			English	Review						chair restraint; nursing; psychiatric inpatient	TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE; PHYSICAL RESTRAINT; EXPERIENCES; SECLUSION; CHILD	This pediatric psychiatric mental health hospital implemented a new mechanical restraint, the chair restraint, as an additional safety management intervention, to join the already utilized six-point board. PurposeThe purpose of this project was to assess perceptions, thoughts, and feelings of psychiatric mental health nursing staff when utilizing the chair restraint on an adolescent unit. Furthermore, to explore decision making related to choosing the chair restraint verses choosing to use the six-point board as a safety management intervention. MethodologyThis was a phenomenological qualitative study, utilizing semistructured interviews to explore the experiences of nursing staff, consisting of behavioral health specialists, and direct-care staff nurses who work on an adolescent psychiatric unit utilizing both chair restraint and the six-point board. Ten nursing staff were interviewed. Using thematic analysis, staff perceptions, thoughts, and feelings when using mechanical restraints for safety management were explored. Demographics were collected however, there was no variability in the responses and saturation was reached. FindingsFive themes emerged from the interviews. The Five themes that emerged were: Restraint chair was less traumatic and preferred, feelings of defeat when de-escalation was not successful, pushing away emotions as protection, units were short staffed, and patient behaviors were seen as a potential barrier to eliminating the six-point board. ConclusionThe results of this study will be used to guide to further develop behavioral health education, orientation for new staff, and to understand ways to support staff through their experiences in managing a patient's unsafe behaviors.

J	Wiens, JJ				Wiens, John J. J.			Trait-based species richness: ecology and macroevolution	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS			English	Article						adaptive radiation; diversification; macroecology; macroevolution; species richness; trait	LATITUDINAL DIVERSITY GRADIENT; ANCESTRAL CHARACTER STATES; BODY-SIZE; TROPICAL CONSERVATISM; DEPENDENT SPECIATION; ADAPTIVE RADIATIONS; EXTINCTION RATES; LIFE-CYCLES; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION	Understanding the origins of species richness patterns is a fundamental goal in ecology and evolutionary biology. Much research has focused on explaining two kinds of species richness patterns: (i) spatial species richness patterns (e.g. the latitudinal diversity gradient), and (ii) clade-based species richness patterns (e.g. the predominance of angiosperm species among plants). Here, I highlight a third kind of richness pattern: trait-based species richness (e.g. the number of species with each state of a character, such as diet or body size). Trait-based richness patterns are relevant to many topics in ecology and evolution, from ecosystem function to adaptive radiation to the paradox of sex. Although many studies have described particular trait-based richness patterns, the origins of these patterns remain far less understood, and trait-based richness has not been emphasised as a general category of richness patterns. Here, I describe a conceptual framework for how trait-based richness patterns arise compared to other richness patterns. A systematic review suggests that trait-based richness patterns are most often explained by when each state originates within a group (i.e. older states generally have higher richness), and not by differences in transition rates among states or faster diversification of species with certain states. This latter result contrasts with the widespread emphasis on diversification rates in species-richness research. I show that many recent studies of spatial richness patterns are actually studies of trait-based richness patterns, potentially confounding the causes of these patterns. Finally, I describe a plethora of unanswered questions related to trait-based richness patterns.	[Wiens, John J.

An estimation and inference procedure for high-dimensional linear regression models with locally stationary error processes is developed. Combined with a proper estimator for the autocovariance matrix of the non-stationary error, the desparsified lasso estimator is adopted for the statistical inference of the regression coefficients under the fixed design setting. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the desparsified estimators is established under certain regularity conditions. Element-wise confidence intervals for regression coefficients are constructed. The finite sample performance of our method is assessed by simulation and real data analysis.

However, the functions of their plant counterparts remain to be characterized. center dot We identified a natural maize crumpled kernel mutant, crk2, which exhibits reductions in endosperm cell number and size, as well as embryo/seedling lethality. Map-based cloning and functional complementation confirmed that ZmTFCB is causal for the mutation. center dot ZmTFCB is targeted mainly to the cytosol. It facilitates alpha-tubulin folding and heterodimer formation through sequential interactions with the cytosolic chaperonin-containing TCP-1 epsilon subunit ZmCCT5 and ZmTFCE, thus affecting the organization of both the spindle and phragmoplast MT array and the cortical MT polymerization and array formation, which consequently mediated cell division and cell growth. We detected a physical association between ZmTFCB and the maize MT plus-end binding protein END-BINDING1 (ZmEB1), indicating that ZmTFCB1 may modulate MT dynamics by sequestering ZmEB1. center dot Our data demonstrate that ZmTFCB is required for cell division and cell growth through modulating MT homeostasis, an evolutionarily conserved machinery with some species-specific divergence.

It can be exacerbated through the excessive water uptake by vegetation during climate droughts, while signs of deep soil drought remain unclear worldwide due to a lack of unified methods and comparative data. In this study, we performed a literature search, focusing on deep soil water profiles (>2 m) and quantification of the degree of deep soil drought as indicated by dried soil layers (DSLs). The results revealed the following: (1) DSLs were distributed worldwide, with mean values of 2.2 +/- 0.5 m, 3.3 +/- 3.9 m, 14.6% +/- 8.3%, and 0.66 +/- 0.14 for the formation depth, thickness, soil water content, and quantitative index, respectively; (2) at the global scale, DSLs were more common and more severe under forestland, including shrubland, than under grassland and farmland; (3) DSLs were shaped directly by rooting depth and soil particle composition and indirectly by land use, soil thickness, terrain, and climate. The preliminary investigation of DSL distribution confirms the existence of DSLs globally, something that has not been addressed in previous studies. Our study provides an early warning of DSL formation in association with rooting depth and soil particle composition under an increased drought condition, which in turn harms vegetation production and sustainability.

The main ore mineral being magnetite, provides an opportunity to study the magnetite texture and iron-oxygen isotope composition of the mineralization, which has heretofore not been reported. These offer insights into the nature and condition of formation of the mineralization thereby paving the way for better understanding the genesis and evolution of the mineralization as well as classifying it. The mineralization is characterized by Type I and Type II magnetite varieties based on their textural features. Type I magnetite is the dominant magnetite and is characterized by ilmenite oxy-exsolution features with triple junction contacts, while Type II magnetite lacks these features. The presence of ilmenite oxy-exsolution features in the Type I magnetite indicates a primary magmatic formation of the magnetite followed by re-equilibration of primary Ti-rich magnetite in the presence of a high-temperature fluid. Oxygen isotope (d(18)O) values for the magnetite range from +2.89% to 9.30 parts per thousand indicating precipitation from evolved ore-forming fluids through reaction with country rocks. The iron isotope (d(56)Fe) of the magnetite shows little variation, with positive values ranging from +0.49-0.66 parts per thousand. These values plot within the magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal magnetite fields when compared to the published global range of d(56)Fe values for different deposit types. A similar result is obtained by plotting the coupled Fe-O isotope pair, further buttressing the magmatic-hydrothermal origin of the mineralization. Based on these data, the Sanaga iron mineralization is best explained as a magmatic-hydrothermal deposit.

The importance of wetland habitat area for waterbird species-richness	IBIS			English	Review						area; habitat variables; landscape; species-richness	BIRD COMMUNITIES; SCALE-DEPENDENCE; POTHOLE REGION; PATCH-SIZE; LANDSCAPE; ASSEMBLAGES; HETEROGENEITY; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; METAANALYSIS	The area of habitat patches is a significant factor when determining species-richness in any given habitat. However, this area effect is not the same for every taxonomic group and can change if is considered together with other habitat variables. The main objective of this study was to identify the importance of wetland area for waterbird species-richness when it is considered in conjunction with other habitat variables. Studies published in the Scopus and Web of Science databases in marine/coastal and inland wetlands were reviewed. A vote-counting approach was conducted to evaluate how many studies include area as a major variable, and a meta-analysis was performed to measure the effect size of the relationship between area and species-richness. Area was a significant predictor of waterbird species-richness in most of the studies (28 of 40 studies, 70%) as assessed by the vote-counting approach, and the mean effect size was high (r = 0.81, n = 1 studies) in the meta-analysis. Few studies reported the shape of the relationship between habitat area and species-richness, but most reported a positive correlation. Although the species-area relationship is widely recognized, our review shows that an important proportion of studies (30%) also found that other habitat variables were significant variables when they were considered together with habitat area. Consequently, in the case of wetlands, habitat area should be considered in conservation, but not as the only measure of management and restoration if the objective is to conserve waterbird biodiversity by improving species-richness.

Herein, Cu-doped CoS2 (Cu-CoS2) nanoparticles are fabricated by a solvothermal method and evaluated as promising cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. Based on physicochemical analysis as well as density functional theory calculations, it is revealed that doping Cu heteroatom in CoS2 lattice can increase the covalency of the Co-S bond with more electron transfer from Co 3d to S 3p orbitals, thereby resulting in less electron transfer from Co 3d to O 2p orbitals of Li-O species, which can weaken the adsorption strength toward Li-O intermediates, decrease the reaction barrier, and thus improve the catalytic performance in Li-O-2 batteries. As a result, the battery using Cu-CoS2 nanoparticles in the cathode exhibits superior kinetics, reversibility, capacity, and cycling performance, as compared to the battery based on CoS2 catalyst. This work provides an atomic-level insight into the rational design of transition-metal dichalcogenide catalysts via regulating the electronic structure for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries.

Moreover, nutrients and flavor substances in the same or various species of wild edible fungi differ greatly with the influence on different components from habitats and geographic areas. So, 5 common wild edible fungi were collected from different areas in Yunnan Province, and several findings were made from this research. Above all, through the evaluation of amino acids, these 5 fungi met the criteria for ideal protein by WHO/FAO, and the nutritional value of protein was ranked as matsutake > truffle > collybia albuminosa > bolete > chanterelle. Next, after the analysis of taste activity values, the ranking of taste was bolete > collybia albuminosa > truffle > matsutake > chanterelle. Subsequently, the ranking of characters was truffle > collybia albuminosa >bolete > matsutake > chanterelle through principal component analysis. Finally, truffle could be completely divided by Fisher discrimination analysis with a bigger difference from others, main in ash, protein, sugar, and polysaccharide, meanwhile, truffle and bolete could be completely divided by orthogonal projections to latent structures discrimination analysis, main in protein, crude fiber, fat, and amino acid. So, there was a more conspicuous difference in nutrients among fungi, through which nutrients combined with multivariate statistics analysis made possible the correct differentiation of small range categories in wild edible fungi, and the correct classification of small range of them could effectively be realized.

Missing the bigger picture: Why insect monitoring programs are limited in their ability to document the effects of habitat loss	CONSERVATION LETTERS			English	Article						Anthropocene; biodiversity; extinction; insect declines; monitoring	DECLINES; LANDSCAPES; AREAS	The fate of insects in the Anthropocene has been widely discussed in the scientific literature, the popular media, and in policy circles. This recent attention is justified because reductions in insect abundance and diversity have the potential to undermine the stability of terrestrial ecosystems. Reports of insect declines have also been accompanied by skepticism that is healthy and to be expected in scientific discussion. However, we are concerned about a prevalent misconception that equates reports from monitored natural areas with the global status of insects. In the vast majority of cases, areas monitored for arthropods are undeveloped and thus do not record or even necessarily reflect the masses of insects that are continuously being impacted by habitat loss to urban, suburban and agricultural expansion. We address this misconception and discuss ways in which conservation and policy can be enhanced by correctly locating results from insect monitoring programs within our broader knowledge of biodiversity loss.

Environmental context and herbivore traits mediate the strength of associational effects in a meta-analysis of crop diversity	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						agroecosystem; crop diversification; intercropping; IPM; neighbourhood effect; plant-insect interaction; push-pull; trap crop	VEGETATIONAL DIVERSITY; POPULATION; DENSITY; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RESISTANCE; COLLARDS; PLANTS; DAMAGE	1. Crop diversification offers a promising solution to meet expanding global food demands while maintaining ecosystem services. Diversification strategies that use mixed planting to reduce pest damage (e.g. intercropping), termed `associational effects' (AE) in the ecological literature, can decrease (associational resistance) or increase (associational susceptibility) herbivore abundance on a focal plant. While application of AE to agroecosystems typically reduces pest abundance, the range of outcomes varies widely. 2. We conducted a meta-analysis using 272 estimates of insect herbivore abundance on crops neighbored by a conspecific or heterospecific from 44 studies undertaken on six continents. We focus on four agricultural crops well represented from sites across the globe to test hypotheses related to understanding how herbivore traits (diet breadth, feeding guild, origin), plant traits (crop type, phylogenetic distance to neighbour) and environmental context (climate, experimental design) contribute to variation in the outcomes of AE. 3. Overall, bicultures provided a strong reduction of insect abundance on the focal crop. Climate and interactions between herbivore traits, particularly diet breadth and origin, and plant traits or environmental context mediated the strength of AE. 4. Bicultures provided the strongest reductions in insect abundance at low latitudes, and this effect decreased at higher latitudes but only for insects with certain traits. Abundance of generalist herbivores and globally distributed pests tended to be most strongly negatively affected by bicultures, under certain contexts, whereas specialist herbivores and native pests were less affected by neighbours. 5. Synthesis and application. This meta-analysis highlights that crop diversification schemes have an overall strongly beneficial effect of reducing pest abundance. However, there was also variability in the outcomes that is determined in part by the interactive effects of herbivore traits and environmental context. The results provide guidance for incorporating beneficial ecological interactions into integrated pest management strategies.

We aim to characterize lower extremity muscle fat fraction (MFF) as a potential biomarker of disease severity, and evaluate its relationship with motor performance in DM2. Methods3-Tesla MRIs were obtained from nine patients with DM2 and six controls using a T1W-Dixon protocol. To calculate MFF, muscle volumes were segmented from proximal, middle, and distal regions of the thigh and calf. Associations between MFF and motor performance were calculated using Spearman's correlations (rho). ResultsMean age of DM2 participants was 62 +/- 11 y (89% female), and mean symptom duration was 20 +/- 12 y. Compared to controls, the DM2 group had significantly higher MFF in the thigh and the calf segments (p-value = .002). The highest MFF at the thigh in DM2 was located in the posterior compartment (39.7 +/- 12.9%) and at the calf was the lateral compartment (31.5 +/- 8.7%). In the DM2 group, we found a strong correlation between the posterior thigh MFF and the 6-min walk test (rho = -.90, p-value = .001). The lateral calf MFF was also strongly correlated with the step test (rho = -0.82, p-value = .006). DiscussionOur pilot data suggest a potential correlation between lower extremity MFF and some motor performance tests in DM2. Longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are required to validate MFF as a marker of disease severity in DM2.

These methods have several key limitations: (1) bounding boxes capture too much background, especially when images experience perspective transformation; (2) insufficient domain-specific data and cost to label; and (3) redundant or incorrect detection results on videos or multi-frame data; where it is a nontrivial task to select the best detection and check for outliers. Recent developments in commercial augmented reality and robotic hardware can be leveraged to support inspection tasks. A common capability of the previous is the ability to obtain image sequences and camera poses. In this work, the authors leverage pose information as "prior" to address the limitations of existing supervised learned, single-shot, semantic detectors for the application of visual inspection. The authors propose an unsupervised semantic segmentation method (USP), based on unsupervised learning for image segmentation inspired by differentiable feature clustering coupled with a novel outlier rejection and stochastic consensus mechanism for mask refinement. USP was experimentally validated for a spalling quantification task using a mixed reality headset (Microsoft HoloLens 2). Also, a sensitivity study was conducted to evaluate the performance of USP under environmental or operational variations.

Postural balance was assessed with their eyes open and closed on both firm and foam surfaces and motor skills were measured using the short version of Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition (Bot-2). Multiple linear regression analysis with stepwise backward selection was used to find a simplified model that best explained the data.Results: Postural balance accounted for 11% of the total variation in fine motor skills, except for the eyes open firm condition, 10% of the gross motor skills and about 14% of the total Bot-2 score. The eyes open foam condition was the only significant contributor to the gross motor skills model and the overall motor score.Conclusion: Assessing postural balance assessment at 5-6 years of age may predict motor skills. It may be useful for monitoring early child development and designing physical activity programmes for this age group.

Design, settingCross-sectional, retrospective survey using the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire-R2: Adapted Version (Australian Child Maltreatment Study); computer-assisted mobile telephone interviews using random digit dialling, Australia, 9 April - 11 October 2021. ParticipantsAustralians aged 16 years or more. The target sample size was 8500 respondents: 3500 people aged 16-24 years and 1000 respondents each from the five age groups (25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65 years or more). Main outcome measuresSelf-reported health service use during the past twelve months: hospital admissions, length of stay, and reasons for admission; and numbers of consultations with health care professionals, overall and by type. Associations between maltreatment and health service use are reported as odds ratios adjusted for age group, gender, socio-economic status, financial hardship (childhood and current), and geographic remoteness. ResultsA total of 8503 participants completed the survey. Respondents who had experienced child maltreatment were significantly more likely than those who had not to report a hospital admission during the preceding twelve months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.66), particularly admission with a mental disorder (aOR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.03-5.6). The likelihood of six or more visits to general practitioners (aOR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.87-3.02) or of a consultation with a mental health nurse (aOR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.75-4.06), psychologist (aOR, 2.40; 95% CI, 2.00-2.88), or psychiatrist (aOR, 3.02; 95% CI, 2.25-4.04) were each higher for people who reported maltreatment during childhood. People who reported three or more maltreatment types were generally most likely to report greater health service use. ConclusionsChild maltreatment has a major impact on health service use. Early, targeted interventions are vital, not only for supporting children directly, but also for their longer term wellbeing and reducing their health system use throughout life.

Herein, a new luminescent zinc(II) coordination polymer, [Zn(4-ABPT)(NIPA)(H2O)], SSICG-5, is synthesized by using a Lewis acidic Zn(II) ion, aromatic nitro group containing ligand 5-nitroisophthalic acid (H(2)NIPA), and basic -NH2 rich ligand 3,5-di(pyridine-4-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-amine (4-ABPT). SSICG-5 can detect Fe3+ and Cr2O72- selectively with a LOD of 0.16 mu M and 1.94 mu M, respectively. Additionally, carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation via one-pot CO2 cycloaddition reaction has significant importance for reduced waste formation, minimizing reaction time and lowering chemical usage. Zn metal centre of SSICG-5 possesses a replaceable coordinated water molecule. The active metal sites combined with the Lewis acidic and basic sites of the ligands make SSICG-5 an ideal bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reaction under room temperature (RT), solvent-free conditions. Notably, SSICG-5 exhibits near quantitative conversion (turnover number (TON) of 198) of propylene oxide to its carbonate compound under mild reaction conditions.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab for prophylaxis of COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients	BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY			English	Review						COVID-19; efficacy; immunocompromised; SARS-CoV-2; tixagevimab; cilgavimab		Immunocompromised patients, such as those with a haematological malignancy, are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe outcomes and mortality. Tixagevimab/cilgavimab is a monoclonal antibody combination which binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The PROVENT phase III clinical trial reported that tixagevimab/cilgavimab prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection in immunocompromised participants. However, the trial was conducted before the Omicron variant became prevalent. This systematic review and meta-analysis provide an up-to-date summary of the real-world effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab in immunocompromised patients, including patients with haematological malignancies. Clinical studies from 1 January 2021 to 1 October 2022, which reported breakthrough COVID-19 infections after tixagevimab/cilgavimab, were included. COVID-19-related hospitalisations, intensive care admissions and mortality were also assessed. A meta-analysis was performed to ascertain overall clinical effectiveness. Eighteen studies, with 25 345 immunocompromised participants, including 5438 patients with haematological pathologies, were included in the review. The overall clinical effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab against COVID-19 breakthrough infection, hospitalisation, intensive care admission and COVID-19-specific mortality was 40.54%, 66.19%, 82.13% and 92.39%, respectively. This review highlights the clinical effectiveness of tixagevimab/cilgavimab at reducing COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes for immunosuppressed individuals, including patients with a haematological malignancy, during the Omicron-predominant era. Real-world studies are important to provide ongoing certainty of the clinical benefit for immunocompromised patients against new SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Herein, various cosensitized DSSCs are prepared using D35, XY1b, and Y123 dyes and employed to construct cobalt tandem DSSCs. First, the performance of single cells with and without scattering layers is studied. The results show that the cosensitized cells using D35 + XY1b and XY1b + Y123 dyes have higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the others, attributed to their longer light absorption wavelength and higher charge recombination resistance. Furthermore, the XY1b + Y123 cell has significantly higher open circuit voltage (V-oc) but slightly lower current density (J(sc)) than those of the D35 + XY1b cell. The cosensitized systems are further utilized to prepare tandem cells. Photoelectrodes without and with scattering layers are used as top and bottom cells, respectively. It shows that by using D35 + XY1b (higher J(sc)) and XY1b + Y123 (higher V-oc) as sensitizers of top and bottom cells, respectively, a PCE as high as 36.27% can be achieved under fluorescent lighting. The cells using these dyes have high long-term stability at room temperature.

Although the approach produces less ambiguous bundlings, it suffers from high computational cost. In this paper, we present a new Edge-Path bundling approach that increases the computational speed of the algorithm without reducing the quality of the bundling. First, we demonstrate that biconnected components can be processed separately in an Edge-Path bundling of a graph without changing the result. Then, we present a new edge bundling algorithm that is based on observing and exploiting a strong relationship between Edge-Path bundling and graph spanners. Although the worst case complexity of the approach is the same as of the original Edge-Path bundling algorithm, we conduct experiments to demonstrate that the new approach is 5-256 times faster than Edge-Path bundling depending on the dataset, which brings its practical running time more in line with traditional edge bundling algorithms.

In order to explore the relationship between oxygen function groups in the catalysts and their catalysis behavior, we prepared graphene-based catalysts with different oxygen densities for formaldehyde reduction reaction by adjusting the content of oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphene surface. We found that oxygen-rich graphene (oGO) exhibited the highest activity as well as selectivity for the electroreduction of formaldehyde to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). Compared with graphite sheets and reduced graphene (rGO), the oGO exhibit the highest 1,2-PDO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 27.4% with partial current density of 13.7 mA cm(-2) at pH 7. In-situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) confirms that the increased content of oxygen-containing groups on the catalyst surface promotes the adsorption and enrichment of (H2CO)-H-center dot, which in turn facilitates the coupling reaction to form 1,2-PDO.

However, non-invasive trapping and removal of such biothreats during cell culturing, particularly many precious cells, is of great challenge. Here, inspired by the wake-riding effect, a biocompatible opto-hydrodynamic diatombot (OHD) based on optical trapping navigated rotational diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin) for non-invasive trapping and removal of nano-biothreats is reported. Combining the opto-hydrodynamic effect and optical trapping, this rotational OHD enables the trapping of bio-targets down to sub-100 nm. Different nano-biothreats, such as adenoviruses, pathogenic bacteria, and mycoplasmas, are first demonstrated to be effectively trapped and removed by the OHD, without affecting culturing cells including precious cells such as hippocampal neurons. The removal efficiency is greatly enhanced via reconfigurable OHD array construction. Importantly, these OHDs show remarkable antibacterial capability, and further facilitate targeted gene delivery. This OHD serves as a smart micro-robotic platform for effective trapping and active removal of nano-biothreats in bio-microenvironments, and especially for cell culturing of many precious cells, with great promises for benefiting cell-based bio-analysis and biomanufacturing.

Abundance and distribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with oil-yielding plants	JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						AMF; colonization; fungi; oil-yielding; symbiosis	DIVERSITY; NUTRITION; ROOTS	Due to their role in nutrient transmission, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread plant root symbionts. They may improve plant production by altering plant community structure and function. Therefore, a study was conducted in the state of Haryana to analyze the distribution pattern, diversity, and association of different AMF species with oil-yielding plants. The results of the study revealed the percentage of root colonization, sporulation, and diversity of fungal species associated with the selected 30 oil-yielding plants. The percentage root colonization ranged from 0% to 100%, the highest in Helianthus annuus (100.00 +/- 0.00) and Zea mays (100.00 +/- 0.00) and the least in Citrus aurantium (11.87 +/- 1.43). At the same time, there was no root colonization in the Brassicaceae family. The number of AMF spores present in 50 g of soil samples varied from 17.41 +/- 5.28 to 497.2 +/- 8.38, with maximum spore population in Glycine max (497.2 +/- 8.38) and minimum in Brassica napus (17.41 +/- 5.28). Besides, the presence of several species of different genera of AMF was reported in all the studied oil-yielding plants, that is, 60 AMF belonging to six genera viz. Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis, and Scutellospora were observed. Overall, this study will promote AMF usage in oil-yielding plants.

However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z-Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen-induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z-Scheme electron transfer from gamma-Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo-generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z-Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.

In some superrosids, the root hair cells and nonhair cells are distributed randomly (Type I pattern), and in others, they are arranged in a position-dependent manner (Type III pattern). The model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) adopts the Type III pattern, and the gene regulatory network (GRN) that controls this pattern has been defined. However, it is unclear whether the Type III pattern in other species is controlled by a similar GRN as in Arabidopsis, and it is not known how the different patterns evolved. center dot In this study, we analyzed superrosid species Rhodiola rosea, Boehmeria nivea, and Cucumis sativus for their root epidermal cell patterns. Combining phylogenetics, transcriptomics, and cross-species complementation, we analyzed homologs of the Arabidopsis patterning genes from these species. center dot We identified R. rosea and B. nivea as Type III species and C. sativus as Type I species. We discovered substantial similarities in structure, expression, and function of Arabidopsis patterning gene homologs in R. rosea and B. nivea, and major changes in C. sativus. center dot We propose that in superrosids, diverse Type III species inherited the patterning GRN from a common ancestor, whereas Type I species arose by mutations in multiple lineages.

Therefore, understanding and optimizing the electrolyte distribution is vital to maximizing power output and achieving low degradation. Although challenging, tracking the PA in nanometer-sized pores is essential because most active sites in the commonly used carbon black-supported catalysts are located in pores below 1 mu m. For this study, a cell is operated at 200 mA cm(-2) for 5 days. After this break-in period, the cathode is separated from the membrane electrode assembly and subsequently investigated by cryogenic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (cryo FIB-SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). PA is located on the surface and in the bulk of the cathode catalyst layer. In addition, the PA distribution can be successfully linked to the gas diffusion electrode morphology and the binder distribution. The PA preferably invades nanometer-sized pores and is uniformly distributed in the catalyst layer.

The main macroscopic findings were widely disseminated, multinodular, whitish lesions involving liver and kidney and severe and diffuse haemorrhagic jejunitis. Histopathologically, the nodules are characterised by sheets of neoplastic round cells. An immunohistochemical panel including lymphoid, histiocytic/myeloid and pan-neuroendocrine markers was performed. Taking into account the epidemiology of malignant round cell tumours in camelids, the neoplastic cell morphology as well as the negativity to all the tested markers, null cell lymphoma is considered as the most likely differential diagnosis. As recently highlighted by the literature, these findings confirm lymphoma as a potential systemic and aggressive neoplasm in young alpacas.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Department of Health and Human Services held a virtual SoS in transfusion medicine (TM) symposium. Study Design and MethodsIn advance of the symposium, six multidisciplinary working groups (WG) convened to define research priorities in the areas of: blood donors and the supply, optimizing transfusion outcomes for recipients, emerging infections, mechanistic aspects of components and transfusion, new computational methods in transfusion science, and impact of health disparities on donors and recipients. The overall objective was to identify key basic, translational, and clinical research questions that will help to increase and diversify the volunteer donor pool, ensure safe and effective transfusion strategies for recipients, and identify which blood products from which donors best meet the clinical needs of specific recipient populations. ResultsOn August 29-30, 2022, over 400 researchers, clinicians, industry experts, government officials, community members, and patient advocates discussed the research priorities presented by each WG. Dialogue focused on the five highest priority research areas identified by each WG and included the rationale, proposed methodological approaches, feasibility, and barriers for success.

Despite the breadth of research on dating violence, studies examining control tactics in youth relationships are limited. The current qualitative study documented control tactics from the perspective of youth who are currently in dating relationships. MethodIndividual semistructured interviews were conducted with 39 participants aged 15-22 years old to gather information regarding conflict management strategies used in their dating relationships. The participants were recruited from high schools and junior colleges across the province of Quebec, Canada. ResultsDirect content analysis revealed three categories of control tactics, including, isolation, domination, and emotional manipulation. These findings highlight the importance of further examining control dynamics in adolescent and emerging adult dating relationships to improve dating violence prevention programs. ConclusionsEducational programs can help prevent control from escalating to more direct forms of violence by supporting youth in identifying unhealthy relationship dynamics and providing them with tools to either safely end the relationship or communicate their concerns with their partner.

Methods: This retrospective study consisted of four pregnant women who underwent fetal pulmonary or aortic balloon valvuloplasty between November 2020 and June 2021. The procedures were performed with a percutaneous cardiac puncture under the ultrasonography guidance. Gestational age at intervention, procedural success, complications, and perinatal outcomes were evaluated. Procedural complications defined as fetal bradyarrhythmia requiring treatment, pericardial effusion requiring drainage, balloon rupture, and fetal death. The procedure was considered technically successful if the valve was dilated with a balloon catheter. Ultimately successful procedure was defined as the discharge of infants alive with biventricular circulation. Results: A total of 5 FCIs attempted between 26 + 3 and 28 + 2 gestational weeks. While the procedure was technically successful in 2 cases with pulmonary stenosis, both attempts were unsuccessful in the fetus with pulmonary atresia. Although the procedure was technically successful in the patient with critical aortic stenosis, it ultimately failed. No fetal death occurred in our series and there were no procedure-related significant maternal complications. However, three interventions were complicated by fetal bradycardia and pericardial effusion necessitating treatment, and balloon rupture cropped up in one case. Conclusion: FCIs may lead to improving the likelihood of a biventricular outcome for selected fetuses. Careful selection of patients and centralization of experience are essential for obtaining favorable outcomes. Operators should be aware of procedural complications. Improved procedural techniques with a lower complication rate will be achieved through advanced medical technology and special balloon catheters.

As a switchable solvent, triethylamine (TEA) was used. In situ generation of CO2 using effervescent tablet containing Na2CO3 and citric acid changed the hydrophobic TEA to the hydrophilic protonated triethylamine carbonate (P-TEA-C). CO2 removal from the specimen solution using NaOH caused P-TEA-C to be converted into TEA and led to phase separation, during which diazinon was extracted into the TEA phase. The salting-out process was helpful in enhancing extraction efficiency. In addition, a number of significant parameters that affect extraction recovery were examined. Under optimum conditions, the limit of detection and limit of quantitation were 0.06 and 0.2 ng/ml, respectively. The extraction recovery percentage and pre-concentration factor were obtained at 95 and 190%, respectively, and the precision (inter- and intra-day, relative standard deviation %, n = 5) was <5%.

J	Levin, M; Cohen, N				Levin, Michal; Cohen, Noy			Swelling under Constraints: Exploiting 3D-Printing to Optimize the Performance of Gel-Based Devices	ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						3D-printing; gels; swelling under constraints; swelling-induced stress	HYDROGEL ACTUATORS; CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; FLUID PERMEATION; POLYMER GELS; KINETICS; BEHAVIOR	Stimuli-responsive hydrogels that swell under constraints such as spatial geometric confinement are employed in many applications, including biomedical devices and actuators, to perform mechanical work. Due to the heterogeneous deformations that arise from these constraints, the computation of the swelling-induced stress poses numerical difficulties. This work proposes a simple experimental method based on 3D-printing technologies to characterize this stress. The swelling is investigated under two types of geometric confinements-transversely constraining and elastically constraining boxes. In the former, the box enforces uniaxial swelling of the gel. The results show that the longitudinal deformations decrease as the transverse stretches increase. The elastically constraining box comprises soft walls with various stiffnesses and sizes that deform in response to the swelling-induced stress exerted by the gel. By employing elastic plate theory, a method to determine this stress is developed. The results reveal that: 1) the maximum volumetric deformation is achieved by free swelling and 2) the stress gels exert depends on the wall stiffness and non-linearly decreases as the gel nears its freely swollen state. The insights from this work can be used to optimize the performance of swelling-based systems and characterize the stress generated due to other stimuli such as pH and temperature.

Most riverine fish species in this country are currently under threat by human activities. In addition to those threats, climate change is expected to alter rainfall and temperature regimes, imposing further limitations, particularly to endemic fishes. Therefore, understanding how these species respond to climate change is an important issue in the conservation of Iranian freshwater biodiversity. This study aimed to predict the potential distribution of 16 endemic fish species under two climate change scenarios (i.e., RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) in river habitats of Iran in the 2050s and the 2080s. The analysis is conducted using the MaxEnt model. Seven environmental variables were used for modelling: maximum width, elevation, river slope, the basins occupied by the target species, average annual precipitation, annual mean temperature, and the temperature difference between the coldest and hottest months of the year . The validation of the model for each species showed that AUC (area under the ROC curve) scores range from 0.87 to 0.99. Under optimistic (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios in the 2050s and the 2080s, species will face four different outcomes to their habitat range: reduction (three species), expansion (five species), reduction and expansion (seven species) and no change (one species). It is concluded that most species that are unique in their geographical area will face serious challenges from climate change. Delineating species range changes under climate change scenarios can help prioritise conservation measures for these valuable species. Considering our results, the translocation of species to new locations also should be investigated.

Software development is a dynamic evolutionary process that may result in data distributions (e.g., defect characteristics) varying from version to version. In this case, effective cross-version defect prediction (CVDP) is not easy to achieve. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether the defect prediction method of the threshold-based active learning (TAL) can tackle the problem of the different data distribution between successive versions. Our TAL method includes two stages. At the active learning stage, a committee of investigated metrics is constructed to vote on the unlabeled modules of the current version. We pick up the unlabeled module with the median of voting scores to domain experts. The domain experts test and label the selected unlabeled module. Then, we merge the selected labeled module and the remaining modules with pseudo-labels from the current version into the labeled modules of the prior version to form enhanced training data. Based on the training data, we derive the metric thresholds used for the next iteration. At the defect prediction stage, the iterations stop when a predefined threshold is reached. Finally, we use the cutoff threshold of voting scores, that is, 50%, to predict the defect-prone of the remaining unlabeled modules. We evaluate the TAL method on 31 versions of 10 projects with three prevalent performance indicators. The results show that TAL outperforms the baseline methods, including three variations methods, two common supervised methods, and the state-of-the-art method Hybrid Active Learning and Kernel PCA (HALKP). The results indicate that TAL can effectively address the different data distribution between successive versions. Furthermore, to keep the cost of extensive testing low in practice, selecting 5% of candidate modules from the current version is sufficient for TAL to achieve a good performance of defect prediction.

However, evidence exists that IL-31 is not required for the induction of acute allergic skin inflammation, which might explain why this treatment is less efficacious in some dogs with AD. Hypothesis/Objectives: To compare the comprehensive transcriptome analysis of house dust mite (HDM)-sensitised dogs with and without treatment with LKV to attest our hypothesis that LKV does not majorly affect acute cytokine/chemokine production. Animals: Six HDM-sensitised atopic Maltese-beagle dogs. Materials and Methods: In this cross-over study, the cytokine profiling of acute AD skin lesions was compared by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), with or without LKV-induced inhibition of IL-31. Skin biopsies were obtained from each dog at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 h after epicutaneous HDM allergen provocation. Results: Macroscopic and microscopic skin lesion scores were not significantly different between the LKV-and nontreatment groups at any time points. Likewise, the results of RNA-Seq analysis revealed no significant difference in the messenger (m)RNA expression of the major cytokines between these two groups. In LKV-treated dogs, IL6, IL9, IL13, IL33, CCL17, and CCL22 were significantly upregulated compared to their baseline expression levels, suggesting that these cytokines are unaffected by IL-31 inhibition. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: IL-31 inhibition is insufficient to prevent the expression of other proinflammatory mediators in acute AD and these could be considered as other potential therapeutic targets.

Using classical notions, we study various qualitative features, like existence, uniqueness and investigate Hyers-Ulam stability analysis of the model under consideration. Lagrange's polynomial approach is used for the approximation of nonlinear terms of the system. We carry out numerical simulations for different values of the fractional-order ?. The results obtained are compared with those of the classic order derivatives. It is observed that the results obtained with fractional order are better as compared to the classical order.

PEI was attached to GO through amide bonding, using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as coupling agents. Aminated hyaluronic acid (HA) was then linked to GO-PEI (GOP) via the same route. Nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and thermogravimetric analysis analyses confirmed the successful synthesis of GOP-HA. Finally, FITC was attached to GOP-HA through reaction between the isothiocyanate group of FITC and the amine group of aminated HA. The fluorescence of FITC is quenched in the resulted GOP-HA-FITC nanoprobe. Addition of hyaluronidase can cleave HA chains into small fragments, releasing FITC to emit fluorescence. Importantly, the nanoprobe is highly sensitive and selective, and can enter cells by specifically binding to the CD44 receptor on the surface of Hela cells. Therefore, GOP-HA-FITC nanoprobe could be used in targeted tumor cell imaging for the early diagnosis of cancers.

METHODSCognitive assessments, clinical evaluations, and informant interviews from Cognition and Dementia in the Health and Aging in Africa Longitudinal Study (HAALSI Dementia) were reviewed by an expert panel using a web-based platform to assign a diagnosis of cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia. RESULTSSix hundred thirty-five participants were assigned a final diagnostic category, with 298 requiring adjudication conference calls. Overall agreement between each rater's independent diagnosis and final diagnosis (via the portal or consensus conference) was 78.3%. A moderate level of agreement between raters' individual ratings and the final diagnostic outcomes was observed (average kappa coefficient = 0.50). DISCUSSIONFindings show initial feasibility in using an online consensus approach for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia in remote, rural, and low-resource settings.

Therefore, the development of noninvasive beta-cell imaging is required. In this study, we investigated the utility of the (111)Indium-labeled exendin-4 probe {[Lys12(111In-BnDTPA-Ahx)] exendin-4} (In-111 exendin-4) to evaluate islet graft BCM after intraportal IT. The probe was cultured with various numbers of isolated islets. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were intraportally transplanted with 150 or 400 syngeneic islets. After a 6-week observation following IT, the ex-vivo liver graft uptake of In-111-exendin-4 was compared with the liver insulin content. In addition, the in-vivo liver graft uptake of In-111 exendin-4 using SPECT/CT was compared with that of liver graft BCM measured by a histological method. As a result, probe accumulation was significantly correlated with islet numbers. The ex-vivo liver graft uptake in the 400-islet-transplanted group was significantly higher than that in the control and the 150-islet-transplanted groups, consistent with glycemic control and liver insulin content. In conclusion, in-vivo SPECT/CT displayed liver islet grafts, and uptakes were corroborated by histological liver BCM. In-111-exendin-4 SPECT/CT can be used to visualize and evaluate liver islet grafts noninvasively after intraportal IT.

J	Cleary, AM; Irving, ZC; Mills, C				Cleary, Anne M.; Irving, Zachary C.; Mills, Caitlin			What Flips Attention?	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; Familiarity; Familiarity-detection; Mind-wandering; Involuntary memory; Deja vu; Philosophy		A central feature of our waking mental experience is that our attention naturally toggles back and forth between "external" and "internal" stimuli. In the midst of an externally demanding task, attention can involuntarily shift internally with no clear reason how or why thoughts momentarily shifted inward. In the case of external attention, we are typically exploring and encoding aspects of our external world, whereas internal attention often involves searching for and retrieving potentially relevant information from our memory networks. Cognitive science has traditionally focused on understanding forms of internal and external attention separately, leaving a mystery about what sparks the seemingly automatic shifts between the two. Specifically, what shifts attentional focus from being outward-directed to being inward-directed? We present a candidate mechanism: Familiarity-detection.

We aimed to compare these interventions and the potential to retain benefits with one exercise session per week. We compared blood pressure changes following handgrip and squat isometric training interventions with controls in a randomized controlled multicentre trial in 77 unmedicated hypertensive (SBP >= 130 mmHg) adults. Exercise sessions were performed in the workplace and consisted of four repetitions-three sessions per week for the first 12 weeks (phase 1), and one session per week for the subsequent 12 weeks (phase 2). Office blood pressure (BP) was measured at baseline, post-phase 1 and post-phase 2. Post-phase 1, mean reductions in SBP were significantly greater in handgrip (-11.2 mmHg, n = 28) and squat (-12.9 mmHg, n = 27) groups than in controls (-.4 mmHg; n = 22) but changes in DBP were not. There were no significant within-group changes during phase 2 but SBP was 3.8 mmHg lower in the wall squat than the handgrip group-a small magnitude but clinically important difference. While both interventions produced significant SBP reductions, the wall squat appears to be more effective in maintaining benefits with a minimal training dose. The low time investment to achieve and retain clinically significant SBP reductions-42 and 12 min, respectively-and minimal cost, particularly of the wall squat, make it a promising intervention for delivery in public health settings.

Unfortunately, an acculturation process to racism and sexism has been occurring for generations leading to systemic inequities that will take a long time to disappear. Here, we highlight the existence of current examples of racism, Western-centrism and sexism within: (1) the most popular anatomical atlases used in biological, anthropological and medical education; (2) prominent natural history museums and World Heritage Sites; (3) biological and anthropological scientific research publications; and (4) popular culture and influential children's books and educational materials concerning human biology and evolution.

However, very few studies have compared exposition to PIMs controlling for differences in demographic and health between nursing home residents (NHRs) and community-dwelling older adults (CDOAs). This study aimed to assess the prescribing pattern of PIMs between NHRs and CDOAs.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study over three months in 2019 using the French Health Insurance databases. The study population included 274 971 NHRs and 4 893 721 CDOAs aged 75 years or over. The prevalence ratio (PR) between NHRs and CDOAs of 17 PIM indicators, based on the Beers and STOPP criteria lists, was assessed using multivariable robust Poisson regression adjusted for age, sex, diseases, and polypharmacy.Results During the study period, 54% of NHRs and 29% of CDOAs received at least one PIM. After adjustment, the prevalence of PIMs was 33% higher among NHRs compared to CDOAs (aPR = 1.33; 95% CI [1.33-1.34]). NHRs received PIMs related to benzodiazepines (aPR = 1.43; 95% CI [1.42-1.43]), anticholinergic drugs (aPR = 1.29; 95% CI [1.27-1.31]), and at least three central nervous system-active drugs (aPR = 1.94; 95% CI [1.92-1.96]) more frequently. Prevalence of PIMs related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aPR = 0.50; 95% CI [0.48-0.52]) and long-acting benzodiazepines (aPR = 0.84; 95% CI [0.82-0.85]) was lower among NHRs.Conclusion The NHRs were at greater risk for PIM than CDOAs, although differences exist according to the category of PIMs. As the population is aging, it is essential to promote and evaluate interventions in NHs and the community to enhance medication optimization.

MethodsSelfie pictures (obtained from frontal and back cameras) of 281 South African men differently aged (20-70 years) were obtained and analyzed by an automatic artificial intelligence (AI)-based automatic grading system. Data were compared with the clinical gradings made by experts and dermatologists. ResultsIn all facial signs, both series of gradings were found highly correlated with, however, different coefficients (0.59-0.95), those of marionette lines and cheek pores being of lower values. No differences were observed between data obtained by frontal and back cameras. With age, in most cases, gradings show up to the 50-59 year age-class, linear-like changes. When compared to men of other ancestries, South African men present lower wrinkles/texture, pigmentation, and ptosis/sagging scores till 50-59 years, albeit not much different in the cheek pores sign. The early onset (mean age) of visibility of wrinkles/texture for South African men were (i.e., reaching grade >1) 39 and 45 years for ptosis/sagging. ConclusionThis study completes and enlarges the previous works conducted on men of other ancestries by showing some South African specificities and slight differences with men of comparable phototypes (Afro American).

Kcnma1 gene encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ channels of large conductance (BK channels), and loss-of-function mutations in Kcnma1 are in regards to impaired myogenesis. Herein, we observed a time-course reduction of Kcnma1 expression in the tibialis anterior muscles of leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) diabetic mice. To investigate the role of Kcnma1 in diabetic muscle atrophy, muscle-specific knockdown of Kcnma1 was achieved by mice receiving intravenous injection of adeno-associated virus-9 (AAV9)-encoding shRNA against Kcnma1 under the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter. Impairment on muscle mass and myogenesis were observed in m/m mice with AAV9-shKcnma1 intervention, while this impairment was more obvious in diabetic db/db mice. Simultaneously, damaged mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis showed much severer in db/db mice with AAV9-shKcnma1 intervention. RNA sequencing revealed the large transcriptomic changes resulted by Kcnma1 knockdown, and changes in mitochondrial homeostasis-related genes were validated. Besides, the artificial alteration of Kcnma1 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts was achieved with an adenovirus vector. Consistent results were demonstrated by Kcnma1 knockdown in palmitate-treated cells, whereas opposite results were exhibited by Kcnma1 overexpression. Collectively, we document Kcnma1 as a potential keeper of mitochondrial homeostasis, and the loss of Kcnma1 is a critical event in priming skeletal muscle loss in diabetes.

We present the case of a spontaneous peri-aortic hematoma in a 66-year-old male with associated left atrial thrombus. This 66-year-old male presented to a local emergency department with non-radiating epigastric and mid-sternal chest pain and was found to have a non-traumatic peri-aortic hematoma of unknown etiology that developed over a period of 12 hours. Imaging revealed a newly formed left atrial thrombus causing mass effect on the pulmonary veins and a newly formed left-sided pleural effusion. The patient was subsequently transferred to an outside facility for higher level of care where additional pathological etiologies of hematoma were further excluded. Before discharge, the hematoma spontaneously dissipated and the patient was discharged on oral anticoagulants for treatment of the atrial thrombus and advised to follow-up on an outpatient basis with hematology and cardiology specialists.

Spatiotemporal Variability Comparisons of Water Quality and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in an Oklahoma Stream	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION			English	Article						Escherichia coli; fecal indicator bacteria; sampling; freshwater; stream	BACTERIA; SEDIMENTS; RIVERS; LOADS	Fecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli, for primary body contact recreation (PBCR) in Oklahoma waterbodies, is defined as the geometric mean of 10 samples from the recreation season, May 1 to September 30, with an impairment threshold of 126 colony forming units (cfu) per 100 mL. However, the water quality standards provide limited guidance on spatiotemporal and environmental factors that could influence samples collected and analyzed. In this study, two stream cross sections under baseflow conditions in a central Oklahoma urban perennial stream, Spring Creek, were densely sampled to investigate temporal and spatial variability of E. coli concentrations and water quality parameters across the stream channel. Water quality parameters (specific conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and total suspended solids (TSS)), stream discharge, and bacteria samples were collected simultaneously at equal intervals across the two cross sections in the morning and afternoon during one summer day with sunny, dry, and hot weather conditions. Results indicate a significant difference between time-of-day samples and water quality parameters and E. coli concentrations. Strong correlations between temperature, dissolved oxygen, and time versus E. coli concentrations were observed, while location, turbidity, and TSS were not significant or correlated to measured values. Furthermore, E. coli concentrations were highly variable spatially across each stream cross section, regardless of time of day or location. Results from this study provide an initial indication that stream water quality, spatial cross section sample location, and diurnal variations may be influencing factors on bacteria concentrations.

We propose an ultrasound-based approach to compute a Functional Safe Zone (FSZ) considering daily positions. Our goal was to validate it, and to evaluate how the input parameters impact the FSZ size and barycentre. The accuracy of the FSZ was first assessed by comparing the FSZ computed by the proposed approach and the true FSZ determined by 3D modelling. Then, the input parameters' impact on the FSZ was studied using a principal component analysis. The FSZ was estimated with errors below 0.5 degrees for mean anteversion, mean inclination, and at edges. The pelvic tilts and the neck orientation were found correlated to the FSZ mean orientation, and the target ROM and the prosthesis dimensions to the FSZ size. Integrated into the clinical workflow, this non-ionising approach can be used to easily determine an optimal patient-specific cup orientation minimising the risks of dislocation.

We examine a range of moving window techniques that have been proposed in the literature. We extend previous works by considering factor models using principal components and dynamic factors. We then consider the use of forecast combinations with time-varying weights. Our basic finding is that moving windows do not produce a clear benefit to forecasting. Time-varying combination of forecasts does produce a substantial improvement in forecasting accuracy.

Emerging evidence has shown that differentially expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) after SCI is closely associated with the pathophysiological process. Herein, the potential function of circRNA spermine oxidase (circSmox) in functional recovery after SCI was investigated. Methods: Differentiated PC12 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were employed as an in vitro model for neurotoxicity research. Levels of genes and proteins were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein level of apoptosis-related markers. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL- 6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Dual-luciferase reporter, RIP, and pull-down assays were used to confirm the target relationship between miR-340-5p and circSmox or Smurf1 (SMAD Specific E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 1). Results: LPS elevated the levels of circSmox and Smurf1, but decreased the levels of miR-340-5p in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Functionally, circSmox silencing alleviated LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation in PC12 cells in vitro. Mechanistically, circSmox directly sponged miR-340-5p, which targeted Smurf1. Rescue experiments showed that miR-340-5p inhibition attenuated the neuroprotective effect of circSmox siRNA in PC12 cells. Moreover, miR-340-5p suppressed LPS-triggered neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, which was reversed by Smurf1 overexpression. Conclusion: CircSmox enhances LPS-induced apoptosis and inflammation via miR-340-5p/Smurf1 axis, providing an exciting view of the potential involvement of circSmox in SCI pathogenesis.

J	Heo, S; Han, J; Park, WK				Heo, Sewan; Han, Jinsoo; Park, Wan-Ki			Control strategies of energy storage limiting intermittent output of solar power generation: Planning and evaluation for participation in electricity market	ETRI JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						solar power generation; power system planning; power generation control; energy storage; energy management	RENEWABLE ENERGY; SYSTEM	Renewable energy generation cannot be consistently predicted or controlled. Therefore, it is currently not widely used in the electricity market, which requires dependable production. In this study, reliability- and variance-based controls of energy storage strategies are proposed to utilize renewable energy as a steady contributor to the electricity market. For reliability-based control, photovoltaic (PV) generation is assumed to be registered in the power generation plan. PV generation yields a reliable output using energy storage units to compensate for PV prediction errors. We also propose a runtime state-of-charge management method for sustainable operations. With variance-based controls, changes in rapid power generation are limited through ramp rate control. This study introduces new reliability and variance indices as indicators for evaluating these strategies. The reliability index quantifies the degree to which the actual generation realizes the plan, and the variance index quantifies the degree of power change. The two strategies are verified based on simulations and experiments. The reliability index improved by 3.1 times on average over 21 days at a real power plant.

In this work, a one-pot method is used to prepare "living" polymer networks and modify their mechanical properties via the photo-electron/energy transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) photopolymerization method. The "living" networks are made from company-bought constituents (N,N-dimethylacrylamide [DMAm] monomer and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate [PEGDA] 700 crosslinker) so that no synthesis is involved. The study uses two different RAFT agents: asymmetric 2-(n-butyltrithiocarbonate) propionic acid (BTPA) and symmetric S,S-dibenzyl trithiocarbonate (DBTTC). The study then modifies these parent networks with three monomers (acrylamide [AAm], DMAm, and methyl acrylate [MA]) by recommencing the PET-RAFT process. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are conducted on the "living" networks to investigate the effects of monomer insertion after photo-growth. The networks are also subjected to compression testing, where the daughter networks display modified mechanical properties dependent on both the choice of monomer and RAFT agent symmetry.

Mitochondrial DNA defects are now an established cause of maternal inheritance diseases. Recent cellular studies have highlighted the mitochondrial interaction with other cellular organelles that lead to disease conditions such as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where defective mitochondria was found in melanocytes of these patients. Vitiligo, a depigmentory ailment of the skin, is another such disorder whose pathogenesis is now found to be associated with mitochondria. The complete absence of melanocytes at the lesioned site in vitiligo is a fact; however, the precise mechanism of this destruction is still undefined. In this review we have tried to discuss and link the emerging facts of mitochondrial function or its inter- and intra-organellar communications in vitiligo pathogenesis. Mitochondrial close association with melanosomes, molecular involvement in melanocyte-keratinocyte communication and melanocyte survival are new paradigm of melanogenesis that could ultimately account for vitiligo. This definitely adds the new dimensions to our understanding of vitiligo, its management and designing of future mitochondrial targeted therapy for vitiligo.

THC was administered via daily oral gavage with the lipid carrier polyenylphosphatidylcholine (PPC) as add-on therapy to losartan (angiotensin receptor blocker) to examine effects on kidney oxidative stress and fibrosis. A combination of unilateral nephrectomy, high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin was used to induce diabetic nephropathy in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals with fasting blood glucose >200 mg/dL were randomized to PPC, losartan, THC + PPC or THC + PPC + losartan. Untreated chronic kidney disease (CKD) animals had proteinuria, decreased creatinine clearance, and evidence of kidney fibrosis on histology. THC + PPC + losartan treatment significantly lowered blood pressure concurrent with increased messenger RNA levels of antioxidant copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase and decreased protein kinase C-alpha, kidney injury molecule-1 and type I collagen in the kidneys; there was decreased albuminuria and a trend for increased creatinine clearance compared to untreated CKD rats. There was decreased fibrosis on kidney histology in PPC-only and THC-treated CKD rats. Plasma levels of kidney injury molecule-1 were decreased in THC + PPC + losartan animals. In summary, add-on THC to losartan therapy improved antioxidant levels and decreased fibrosis in the kidneys, and lowered blood pressure in diabetic CKD rats.

Juglans regia's wide variety of anticancer actions have been demonstrated. The aim of this study is evaluating the cytotoxic and antioxidant effects of walnut oil (J. regia) nanoemulsion (WO-NE) on CT26 colon cancer cell line. The dimensions and structure of the nanoemulsion were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) technique was used to determine whether or not the nanoemulsions had any antioxidant properties. The cytotoxic effects of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2-5-[diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) on CT26 colon cancer cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as normal cells were measured. The DPPH experiment demonstrated that the manufactured nanoemulsion had the ability to scavenge free radicals in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of approximately 500 mu g/mL. The WO-NE were found to be toxic to both HUVEC and CT26 cancer cells, with an IC50 of 10 +/- 2.6 mu g/mL for the CT26 and 160 +/- 7.1 mu g/mL for the HUVEC after 24 h of incubation. For comparison the effects of walnut oil also have been investigated. Due to their antioxidant and anticancer capabilities, the WO-NE synthesized here have been proposed for future study as potential anti-tumour agents.

Although the receptor is considered a therapeutic target for these diseases, its neurophysiological function has not been fully elucidated. Pharmacological functional MRI (phfMRI) has been used to evaluate regional brain hemodynamic changes induced by neurovascular coupling resulting from pharmacological interventions, thus phfMRI studies can be used to help understand the neurophysiological function of specific receptors. Herein, the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes associated with D1R action in anesthetized rats was investigated by using a preclinical ultra-high-field 11.7-T MRI scanner. PhfMRI was performed before and after administration of the D1-like receptor agonist (SKF82958), antagonist (SCH39166), or physiological saline subcutaneously. Compared to saline, the D1-agonist induced a BOLD signal increase in the striatum, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum. At the same time, the D1-antagonist reduced the BOLD signal in the striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum by evaluating temporal profiles. PhfMRI detected D1R-related BOLD signal changes in the brain regions associated with high expression of D1R. We also measured the early expression of c-fos at the mRNA level to evaluate the effects of SKF82958 and isoflurane anesthesia on neuronal activity. Regardless of the presence of isoflurane anesthesia, c-fos expression level was increased in the region where positive BOLD responses were observed with administration of SKF82958. These findings demonstrated that phfMRI could be used to identify the effects of direct D1 blockade on physiological brain functions and also for neurophysiological assessment of dopamine receptor functions in living animals.

The humoral immune response dynamics after booster inactivated vaccinations in PLWH remain unclear. In this longitudinal observational study, 100 PLWH after primary inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were consecutively recruited and followed up. After booster vaccination (BV), neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were detected at 1 month from all the PLWH, and the titer increased sixfold compared to that associated with the primary vaccination (PV), similar to that in healthy controls after BV. The NAbs titer declined over time after BV, but remained higher at 6 months than after PV. The NAbs response was elevated after BV with CD4 count <200 cells/mu L, it was the poorest among the different CD4 cell count subgroups. Similar results were observed for anti-RBD-IgG responses. Moreover, RBD-specific MBCs were significantly elevated after BV in PLWH. No serious AEs were observed after BV in PLWH. In conclusion, booster inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is well tolerated and can elicit robust and durable humoral responses in PLWH. PLWH may benefit from a third dose of the inactivated vaccine.

Forest harvesting causes habitat loss and alteration and can change predator-prey dynamics. In Canada, forest harvesting has shifted the distribution and abundance of ungulates (deer, elk and moose) that prefer early seral forest, resulting in unsustainable caribou predation by shared predators (bears, cougars and wolves). Long-term solutions for caribou recovery require management to reduce ungulate prey species within caribou ranges. Silviculture practices applied after forest harvesting directly affect the amount of forage available in harvested areas, and therefore influence ungulate distribution, but few studies have completed detailed assessments on how specific treatments of site preparation, planting and stand tending influence ungulate use of harvest blocks.2. We used camera traps, silviculture data, GIS-derived habitat and disturbance data, and detailed vegetation data collected at field sites to investigate ungulate occurrence in harvest blocks in west-central Alberta, Canada. We compared seasonal ungulate occurrence and investigated how site-specific characteristics, the surrounding habitat and disturbance density, and fine-scale silviculture treatments influenced ungulate occurrence in blocks.3. Deer, elk and moose occurrence was higher in summer compared to winter. Elk, moose and white-tailed deer occurrence was higher in blocks with greater availability of specific forage species. Moose occurrence was higher in blocks with a lower road density in the surrounding area, and white-tailed deer occurrence was higher in blocks further from seismic lines and with a lower proportion of harvest blocks in the surrounding area.4. Deer, elk and moose occurrence was higher in younger harvest blocks. Mule deer and white-tailed deer occurrence was lower in blocks with higher planting densities of lodgepole pine, and mule deer occurrence was also lower in blocks that had been stand tended.5. Our study provides detailed information on ungulate response to fine-scale silviculture methods used in Alberta, directly linking wildlife occurrence to forestry practices, and providing practical scientific information to inform sustainable forestry. Translating this research into practical landscape management decisions could benefit boreal biodiversity, including threatened species like caribou, and culturally and economically important species like deer, elk and moose.

This study explored the potential of Fe(III)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Fe(III)-DTPA) and Fe(III)-ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N ',N '-tetraacetic acid (Fe(III)-EGTA) in activating the UV/persulfate (UV/PS) for sulfamethazine removal. The initial screening showed that Fe(III)-EGTA and Fe(III)-DTPA could significantly improve the rate of sulfamethazine removal. The optimum molar ratios of persulfate to Fe(III)-DTPA and Fe(III)-EGTA were 100:1 and 100:2.5. The predicted percentage of sulfamethazine removal under the optimized conditions, obtained using response surface methodology, was similar to 99% for both catalysts. The pH range of 6 to 8 did not significantly affect the performance of UV/PS in the removal of sulfamethazine. The percentage sulfamethazine removal in the selected water samples was ranged from 93.6% to 99.6%, agreeing with the predicted value. The performance of both catalysts in activating UV/PS is comparable with that of the frequently used Fe(III)-EDDS. Practitioners Points The potential of Fe(III)-DTPA and Fe(III)-EGTA in activating UV/persulfate (UV/PS) was explored.Fe(III)-DTPA and Fe(III)-EGTA improved the performance of UV/PS in sulfamethazine removal.Fe(III)-DTPA and Fe(III)-EGTA are effective in catalyzing UV/PS under pH 6 to 8.The performance of Fe(III)-DTPA and Fe(III)-EGTA is comparable with well-studied Fe(III)-EDDS.

The raw and processed fibers as well as the composite papers with MWCNTs are examined with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The four-probe method is utilized to quantify the conductivity of the nanocomposite paper. The FTIR study reveals the removal of non-cellulosic components of plant fibers such as hemicelluloses, lignin, pectin, etc. during the chemical treatment. XRD analysis shows that the crystallinity of raw fiber increases from 56% to 63% after bleaching. The POM imaging of different samples also indicates an increase in the smoothness of the particle morphology, a decrease in particle size, and removal of lignin during the chemical treatment as suggested by the FTIR study. The composite paper comprising 5 and 10 wt% of MWCNT shows exceptionally high bulk conductivity of 1.56 and 6.27 S cm(-1), respectively.

However, whether predators may be scary also after death remains unexplored. Here, we describe the "fight-and-flight" responses of a prey, the wild boar (Sus scrofa), to carcasses of (a) its main predator, the gray wolf (Canis lupus) and (b) a carnivore that very rarely kills wild boars, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), in the western Alps (Italy). We recorded the behavior of wild boars at 10 wolf and 9 fox carcass sites. We found eight "fight-and-flight" responses toward wolf carcasses, and none toward fox carcasses. Our results suggest that carnivore carcasses may indeed be scary; fear responses toward them are dependent on the species to which the carcass belongs; and animals approaching the carcasses are feared mainly when the latter are relatively fresh. This emphasizes the multiple and complex roles that carrion plays in the landscape of fear and opens exciting ecological, epidemiological, and evolutionary research avenues.

We analyzed open-ended speech samples from a prodromal-to-mild AD cohort to develop a novel composite score to characterize progressive speech changes. Participant speech from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview was analyzed to compute metrics reflecting speech and language characteristics. We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD. Speech-based composite scores could be used to monitor change and detect response to treatment in future research. HIGHLIGHTSLongitudinal speech samples were analyzed to characterize speech changes in early AD.Acoustic and linguistic measures showed significant change over 18 months.A novel speech composite score was computed to characterize longitudinal change.The speech composite correlated with primary and secondary trial endpoints.Automated speech analysis could facilitate remote, high frequency monitoring in AD.

Restoration and resilience to sea level rise of a salt marsh affected by dieback events	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						dieback; drought; elevation; resilience; salt marsh; sea level rise; urban ecosystem	SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; COASTAL MARSHES; R PACKAGE; ELEVATION; DROUGHT; MODEL; CORDGRASS; RESPONSES; CAROLINA; WETLANDS	The frequency of salt marsh dieback events has increased over the last 25 years with unknown consequences to the resilience of the ecosystem to accelerated sea level rise (SLR). Salt marsh ecosystems impacted by sudden vegetation dieback events were previously thought to recover naturally within a few months to years. In this study, we used a 13-year collection of remotely sensed imagery to provide evidence that approximately 14% of total marsh area has not revegetated 10 years after a dieback event in Charleston, SC. Dieback onset coincided with a severe drought in 2012, as indicated by the Palmer drought stress index. A second dieback event occurred in 2016 after a historic flood influenced by Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Unvegetated zones reached nearly 30% of the total marsh area in 2017. We used a light detection and ranging-derived digital elevation model to determine that most affected areas were associated with lower elevation zones in the interior of the marsh. Further, restoration by grass planting was effective, with pilot-scale restored plots having greater aboveground biomass than reference sites after two years of transplanting. A positive outcome indicated that the stressors that caused the dieback are no longer present. Despite that, many affected areas have not recovered naturally, even though they are located within the typical elevation range of healthy marshes. A mechanistic modeling approach was used to assess the effects of vegetation dieback on salt marsh resilience to SLR. Predictions indicate that a highly productive restored marsh (2000 g m(-2) year(-1)) would persist at a moderate SLR rate of 60 cm in 100 years, whereas a nonrestored mudflat would lose all its elevation capital after 100 years. Thus, rapid restoration of marsh dieback is critical to avoid further degradation. Also, failure to incorporate the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events that trigger irreversible marsh diebacks underestimates salt marsh vulnerability to climate change. Finally, at an elevated SLR rate of 122 cm in 100 years, which is most likely an extreme climate change scenario, even highly productive ecosystems augmented by sediment placement would not keep pace with SLR. Thus, climate change mitigation actions are also urgently needed to preserve present-day marsh ecosystems.	[Rolando, J. L.; Garcia, K. D.; Krueger, G.; Kostka, J.

In vivo tests are usually suggested as a first step; however, prick and intradermal tests could be painful and have shown different sensitivity and specificity among published studies. In some cases, in vivo tests such as Drug Provocation test (DPT) could be even contraindicated. Therefore, the need for in vitro testing is compelling, to add useful information along the diagnostic pathway and to limit the need of DPT. In this review, we analyze the different types of in vitro tests, focusing on those used more widely such as specific IgE and on those that are still for research settings, such as basophil activation test and lymphocyte transformation test, but that have shown some useful diagnostic potential.

Moreover, due to the lack of anti-monkeypox drugs and vaccines against monkeypox, the spread of this virus may be the beginning of another challenge. In this study, novel antibodies against monkeypox virus were modeled based on a heavy chain of human antibody and a small peptide fragment. Docking of modeled antibodies with C19L protein showed the range of docking energy, and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was from -124 to -154 kcal/mL and 4-6 angstrom, respectively. Also, docking of modeled antibodies-C19L complex with gamma Fc receptor type I illustrated the range of docking energy, and RMSD was from -132 to -155 kcal/ml and 5-7 angstrom, respectively. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulation showed that antibody 62 had the highest stability with the lowest energy level and RMSD. Interestingly, no modeled antibodies had immunogenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. Although all of them had good stability, only antibodies 25, 28, 54, and 62 had a half-life of >10 h. Moreover, the interaction between C19L protein and anti-C19L antibodies (wild-type and synthetic) was evaluated by the SPR method. We found that K-D in synthetic antibodies was lower than wild antibody. In terms of dH degrees, TdS degrees, and dG degrees, the results were consistent with binding parameters. Here, the lowest value of thermodynamic parameters was obtained for antibody 62. These data show that the synthetic antibodies, especially antibody 62, had a higher affinity than the wild-type antibody.

J	Shanks, GD				Shanks, George Dennis			Immunisation used for offensive and defensive purposes during the Second World War	INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; WESTERN REGION; ARMY PERSONNEL; VACCINATION; JAUNDICE	The best defence against natural or intentional biological agents during armed conflict is usually immunisation, as with typhoid fever, but exceptional circumstances are informative. A large iatrogenic epidemic of hepatitis B occurred in 1942 due to contaminated lots of yellow fever (YF) vaccine used in the US military, even though there was no natural risk of infection. YF vaccine was intended to protect against Japanese Army's use of YF as a biowarfare agent, which did not eventuate. Salmonella typhi was used to infect German soldiers in a Paris cafe during Christmas 1941 in the knowledge that the cafe staff but not the soldiers were likely to be immunised against typhoid fever. German Army use of the Weil-Felix reaction to eliminate civilians likely to be typhus infected was subverted by Polish medical officers. They immunised civilians with locally produced Proteus antigens to create false-positive Weil-Felix reactions in order to exempt men from forced labour schemes. Immunisation against biowarfare agents has a mixed record, indicating that vaccines rarely cover well for intelligence gaps.

J	Sidky, EY; Pan, XC				Sidky, Emil Y.; Pan, Xiaochuan			Report on the AAPM deep-learning spectral CT Grand Challenge	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						adaptive radiotherapy; deformable image registration; quality assurance		BackgroundThis Special Report summarizes the 2022 AAPM Grand Challenge on Deep-Learning spectral Computed Tomography (DL-spectral CT) image reconstruction. PurposeThe purpose of the challenge is to develop the most accurate image reconstruction algorithm possible for solving the inverse problem associated with a fast kilovolt switching dual-energy CT scan using a three tissue-map decomposition. Participants could choose to use a deep-learning (DL), iterative, or a hybrid approach. MethodsThe challenge is based on a 2D breast CT simulation, where the simulated breast phantom consists of three tissue maps: adipose, fibroglandular, and calcification distributions. The phantom specification is stochastic so that multiple realizations can be generated for DL approaches. A dual-energy scan is simulated where the x-ray source potential of successive views alternates between 50 and 80 kilovolts (kV). A total of 512 views are generated, yielding 256 views for each source voltage. We generate 50 and 80 kV images by use of filtered back-projection (FBP) on negative logarithm processed transmission data. For participants who develop a DL approach, 1000 cases are available. Each case consists of the three 512 x 512 tissue maps, 50 and 80-kV transmission data sets and their corresponding FBP images. The goal of the DL network would then be to predict the material maps from either the transmission data, FBP images, or a combination of the two. For participants developing a physics-based approach, all of the required modeling parameters are made available: geometry, spectra, and tissue attenuation curves. The provided information also allows for hybrid approaches where physics is exploited as well as information about the scanned object derived from the 1000 training cases. Final testing is performed by computation of root-mean-square error (RMSE) for predictions on the tissue maps from 100 new cases. ResultsTest phase submission were received from 18 research groups. Of the 18 submissions, 17 were results obtained with algorithms that involved DL. Only the second place finishing team developed a physics-based image reconstruction algorithm. Both the winning and second place teams had highly accurate results where the RMSE was nearly zero to single floating point precision. Results from the top 10 also achieved a high degree of accuracy; and as a result, this special report outlines the methodology developed by each of these groups. ConclusionsThe DL-spectral CT challenge successfully established a forum for developing image reconstruction algorithms that address an important inverse problem relevant for spectral CT.

Proteomic profiling demonstrates inflammatory and endotheliopathy signatures associated with impaired cardiopulmonary exercise hemodynamic profile in Post Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome	PULMONARY CIRCULATION			English	Article						invasive CPET; PASC; proteomics		Approximately 50% of patients who recover from the acute SARS-CoV-2 experience Post Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) syndrome. The pathophysiological hallmark of PASC is characterized by impaired system oxygen extraction (EO2) on invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET). However, the mechanistic insights into impaired EO2 remain unclear. We studied 21 consecutive iCPET in PASC patients with unexplained exertional intolerance. PASC patients were dichotomized into mildly reduced (EO(2)peak-mild) and severely reduced (EO(2)peak-severe) EO2 groups according to the median peak EO2 value. Proteomic profiling was performed on mixed venous blood plasma obtained at peak exercise during iCPET. PASC patients as a group exhibited depressed peak exercise aerobic capacity (peak VO2; 85 +/- 18 vs. 131 +/- 45% predicted; p = 0.0002) with normal systemic oxygen delivery, DO2 (37 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 15 mL/kg/min; p = 0.43) and reduced EO2 (0.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.1; p < 0.0001). PASC patients with EO(2)peak-mild exhibited greater DO2 compared to those with EO(2)peak-severe [42.9 (34.2-41.2) vs. 32.1 (26.8-38.0) mL/kg/min; p = 0.01]. The proteins with increased expression in the EO(2)peak-severe group were involved in inflammatory and fibrotic processes. In the EO(2)peak-mild group, proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and glycogen metabolism were elevated. In PASC patients with impaired EO2, there exist a spectrum of PASC phenotype related to differential aberrant protein expression and cardio-pulmonary physiologic response. PASC patients with EO(2)peak-severe exhibit a maladaptive physiologic and proteomic signature consistent with persistent inflammatory state and endothelial dysfunction, while in the EO(2)peak-mild group, there is enhanced expression of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation-mediated ATP synthesis along with an enhanced cardiopulmonary physiological response.

Appreciable precipitate is found in the composition range c(x)/c(SiNP) from 0.056 to 0.58, where c(x) and c(SiNP) are the mass concentrations of xanthan and silica nanoparticles, respectively. The sign change of the ? potential for the mixed solutions is observed in the c(x)/c(SiNP) range. Significantly high scattering intensity is detected for the mixed solutions in a wider c(x)/c(SiNP) range, clearly showing the complex formation. The scattering profile measured by the small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that silica nanoparticles are packed loosely in the complex both when xanthan forms double helix and single chain conformations.

Cochlear Implantation in US Military Veterans: A Single Institution Study	OTO OPEN			English	Article						cochlea; cochlear implant; cochlear implantation; hearing loss; inner ear; noise exposure; sensorineural hearing loss	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; PERFORMANCE	ObjectiveMilitary veterans have high rates of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) which is associated with more significant spiral ganglion neuronal loss. This study explores the relationship between NIHL and cochlear implant (CI) outcomes in veterans. Study DesignRetrospective case series of veterans who underwent CI between 2019 and 2021. SettingVeterans Health Administration hospital. MethodsAzBio Sentence Test, Consonant-Nucleus-Consonant (CNC) scores, and Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) were measured pre- and postoperatively. Linear regression assessed relationships between outcomes and noise exposure history, etiology of hearing loss, duration of hearing loss, and Self-Administered Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) scores. ResultsFifty-two male veterans were implanted at an average (standard deviation) age of 75.0 (9.2) years without major complications. The average duration of hearing loss was 36.0 (18.4) years. The average time of hearing aid use was 21.2 (15.4) years. Noise exposure was reported in 51.3% of patients. Objectively, AzBio and CNC scores 6 months postoperatively showed significant improvement of 48% and 39%, respectively. Subjectively, average 6-month SSQ scores showed significant improvement by 34 points (p < .0001). Younger age, SAGE score >= 17, and shorter duration of amplification were associated with higher postoperative AzBio scores. Greater improvement in AzBio and CNC scores was associated with lower preoperative scores. Noise exposure was not associated with any difference in CI performance. ConclusionDespite high levels of noise exposure and advanced age, veterans derive substantial benefits from cochlear implantation. SAGE score >= 17 may be predictive of overall CI outcomes. Noise exposure does not impact CI outcomes. Level of EvidenceLevel 4.	[Totten, Douglas J. J.; Pisoni, David B. B.; Nelson, Rick F.

Also, it hosts a lot of medium- to large-scale sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX) Pb-Zn deposits that mainly occur in Proterozoic metamorphosed clastic-carbonate rocks. In this study, LA-ICP-MS U-Pb analyses were carried out on detrital zircons in siltstones of the Precambrian Haerdaban Group in the Haerdaban Pb-Zn deposit and magmatic zircons in the diorite dyke that cuts through the strata and orebodies. The maximum depositional age of the siltstones was determined to be about 604 Ma, the diorite having formed at approximately 500 Ma. As such, the Haerdaban Group was most likely formed in the Neoproterozoic Sinian, rather than the previously considered Mesoproterozoic Changchengian. Detrital materials of the Haerdaban Group were mostly derived from the Nanhua-Sinian mafic dykes and granitic rocks around Lake Sayram at the northern margin of the Yili Block.

Conventionality Modulates Processing of Emoji	COGNITIVE SCIENCE			English	Article						Emoji; Visual language; Lexicon; Language processing	POLYSEMY	Emoji have been ubiquitous in communication for over a decade, yet how they derive meaning remains underexplored. Here, we examine an aspect fundamental to linguistic meaning-making: the degree to which emoji have conventional lexicalized meanings and whether that conventionalization affects processing in real-time. Experiment 1 establishes a range of meaning agreement levels across emoji within a population; Experiment 2 measures accuracy and response times to word-emoji pairings in a match/mismatch task. In this experiment, we found that accuracy and response time both correlated significantly with the level of population-wide meaning agreement from Experiment 1, suggesting that lexical access of single emoji may be comparable to that of words, even out of context. This is consistent with theories of a multimodal lexicon that stores links between meaning, structure, and modality in long-term memory. Altogether, these findings suggest that emoji can allow a range of entrenched, lexicalized representations.

An excessive immune inflammatory response causes excessive activation of osteoclasts, leading to bone loss and bone destruction. The signaling protein stimulator of interferon gene (STING) can regulate the immune response of osteoclasts. C-176 is a furan derivative that can inhibit activation of the STING pathway and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The effect of C-176 on osteoclast differentiation is not yet clear. In this study, we found that C-176 could inhibit STING activation in osteoclast precursor cells and inhibit osteoclast activation induced by nuclear factor kappa B ligand receptor activator in a dose-dependent manner. After treatment with C-176, the expression of the osteoclast differentiation marker genes nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1(NFATc1), cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, and V-ATPase a3 decreased. In addition, C-176 reduced actin loop formation and bone resorption capacity. The WB results showed that C-176 downregulated the expression of the osteoclast marker protein NFATc1 and inhibited activation of the STING-mediated NF-kappa B pathway. We also found that C-176 could inhibit the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway factors induced by RANKL. Moreover, we verified that C-176 could reduce LPS-induced bone absorption in mice, reduce joint destruction in knee arthritis induced by meniscal instability, and protect against cartilage matrix loss in ankle arthritis induced by collagen immunity. In summary, our findings demonstrated that C-176 could inhibit the formation and activation of osteoclasts and could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory osteolytic diseases.

This study prepared a pyrrhotite-biochar composite (FexSy@BC) to investigate its potential for simultaneous removal of nitrate and phosphate under autotrophic denitrification conditions. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the novel composite of FexSy@BC, which exhibited 9.2 mg N/(L center dot d) NO3--N reduction rate, 97.3% N-2 production, and 81.8 mmol N/(kg center dot d) NO3--N material load with small solid/liquid ratio (0.008). The NO3--N removal with FexSy@BC was 1.2-2.2 times higher than that with pure iron sulfides or biochar or their mixtures, whereas the Delta n(S)/Delta n(N) of FexSy@BC was the lowest (1.80). Moreover, the PO43--P reduction rate of FexSy@BC reached 3.23 mg P/(L center dot d), as high as that of pure pyrite or pyrrhotite. Thiobacillus was the most dominant denitrifying bacterium. FexSy@BC exhibited great promise for enhancing nutrient removal from secondary effluent without additional carbon source.

However, whether NONO plays a role in lymphopoiesis is not known. In this study, we generated mice with global deletion of NONO and bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice in which NONO is deleted in all of mature B cells. We found that the global deletion of NONO in mice did not affect T-cell development but impaired early B-cell development in BM at pro- to pre-B-cell transition stage and B-cell maturation in the spleen. Studies of BM chimeric mice demonstrated that the impaired B-cell development in NONO-deficient mice is B-cell-intrinsic. NONO-deficient B cells displayed normal BCR-induced cell proliferation but increased BCR-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, we found that NONO deficiency impaired BCR-induced activation of ERK, AKT, and NF-kappa B pathways in B cells, and altered BCR-induced gene expression profile. Thus, NONO plays a critical role in B-cell development and BCR-induced B-cell activation.

We report the case of a 57-year-old woman with CA complicated with Eisenmenger syndrome and inferior vena cava interruption, who suffered from symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). She underwent an initial successful pulmonary vein isolation procedure. A repeat procedure for perivalvular atrial flutter was complicated with inadvertent complete AV block, due to unusual AV node location in this challenging anatomy.

View cells in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of macaques during virtual navigation	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						hippocampus; non-human primate; prefrontal cortex; view cells; virtual environment	SPATIAL VIEW; PRIMATE HIPPOCAMPUS; EYE POSITION; NEURONS; MONKEY; PLACE; INFORMATION; SPACE; RESPONSES; CONTEXT	Cells selectively activated by a particular view of an environment have been found in the primate hippocampus (HPC). Whether view cells are present in other brain areas, and how view selectivity interacts with other variables such as object features and place remain unclear. Here, we explore these issues by recording the responses of neurons in the HPC and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of rhesus macaques performing a task in which they learn new context-object associations while navigating a virtual environment using a joystick. We measured neuronal responses at different locations in a virtual maze where animals freely directed gaze to different regions of the visual scenes. We show that specific views containing task relevant objects selectively activated a proportion of HPC units, and an even higher proportion of LPFC units. Place selectivity was scarce and generally dependent on view. Many view cells were not affected by changing the object color or the context cue, two task relevant features. However, a small proportion of view cells showed selectivity for these two features. Our results show that during navigation in a virtual environment with complex and dynamic visual stimuli, view cells are found in both the HPC and the LPFC. View cells may have developed as a multiarea specialization in diurnal primates to encode the complexities and layouts of the environment through gaze exploration which ultimately enables building cognitive maps of space that guide navigation.

Compounds 15 and 18 among the proposed compounds showed promising antiproliferative activity against MCF-7 (IC50 = 1.35 mu M) and HepG2 cells (IC50 = 3.24 mu M), comparable to sorafenib, with IC50 values of 3.04, 2.93 mu M, respectively, according to in situ cytotoxicity testing. Comparing compounds 15 and 18 to sorafenib, the in vitro VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity displayed encouraging selective efficacy with IC50 values of 13, 67, and 30 nM, respectively. Results of VEGFR-2 inhibition at various ATP concentrations proved that there was no statistically significant difference between the IC50 values, which improved the non-ATP competitive binding. Compound 15 caused apoptotic breast cancer cell death with 55.11-fold cell-cycle arrest at the S-phase, where it affected the apoptosis-mediated genes through upregulating P53, Bax, caspases 3, 8, and 9 and downregulating the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2. A molecular docking study was conducted to confirm the binding of the designed compounds to the allosteric site of VEGFR-2 in DFG-out mode, leaving the ATP-binding pocket unoccupied when superimposed to the pose of sorafenib. The designed molecules showed resealable binding affinity toward the DFG loop and the allosteric site. Hence, the 2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one derivative constitutes intriguing starting points for designing apoptotic-inducing drugs.	[Elrayess, Ranza; Ghareb, Nagat; Yassen, Asmaa S.

Investigating correlations between the PAT and three hand-skill exercises to performance in preclinical laboratory courses	JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article						dental anatomy; dental education; dental students; indirect vision; manual dexterity; mirror tracing; operative dentistry; perceptual ability test; preclinical performance; psychomotor skills; restorative dentistry; wax carving	OPERATIVE DENTISTRY PERFORMANCE	ObjectivesPerceptual ability test (PAT) is a valid determinant for spatial perceptions. However, proven psychomotor skill tests for dentistry do not currently exist. This study aimed to determine whether performance on the PAT, Operation game, mirror tracing, and wax carving exercises correlate to preclinical laboratory performance in Dental Anatomy and Restorative Dentistry courses. MethodsFirst-year dental students (n = 96) participated in the study. Final laboratory grades were obtained from course directors of preclinical Restorative Dentistry and Dental Anatomy courses. Admissions committee provided participants' PAT results. Participants completed a wax carving exercise by carving a cube and a semicircle into a wax block using the wax subtraction method. Two calibrated faculty graded the carvings as Ideal (5), Satisfactory (3), or Unsatisfactory (1). Time to complete the Operation game and number of infractions were recorded. Participants traced the six-pointed star pattern on the Auto Scoring Mirror Tracer instrument in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Completion times and number of instances outside the pattern were recorded. Spearman Rank Correlations were used to determine associations at 0.05 confidence interval. ResultsMean PAT score was 21.7; mean times to complete the Operation game and mirror tracing exercise were 4:20 and 1:30, respectively. Mean score on the wax carving exercise was 3.19. Correlations between the independent and dependent variables were minimal to weak. The wax carving exercise was the most reliable predictor of performance. ConclusionsWhen PAT scores are striated into low (less than 20), middle (21-22), and high (23-30), it was possible to predict performance in both preclinical laboratory courses.

However, such research remains largely inaccessible to local communities because of the proprietary nature of the current knowledge ecosystem in academia. This commentary proposes knowledge repatriation as a means of advancing decolonial research efforts within higher education. First, we highlight the intersecting features of epistemic and environmental (in)justice with examples from the Caribbean context and discuss how knowledge repatriation efforts can counter extant environmental and epistemological exploitative practices. Second, we identify how academic institutions are specially positioned to challenge traditional research practices and advance knowledge repatriation. Third, we explore one example of how knowledge repatriation can unfold within a Caribbean context and some related challenges.

However, given the complexity of MNRs' dynamic biological environments and the limitations of current experimental methods, it remains challenging to simulate the motion mechanism, functional implementation strategy, and adaptability of MNRs in dynamic environments. Finite element analysis (FEA) plays an important role in MNR research; thorough review of state-of-the-art research on MNRs. FEA is used to simulate MNRs motion mechanism, and theoretical models combined with experimental results are proposed to explain the motion mechanism. FEA can reduce the error rate of experiments. Combined with the simulation results, the optimal scheme is selected for experiments, and a reliable design strategy of MNRs is obtained. FEA has become a more effective method to obtain the optimal design of MNRs for in vivo applications. Therefore, herein, the design and driving mechanism of MNRs, the different solutions proposed for complex dynamic environments, and the use of FEA in the related research are introduced by this review. The current challenges and future research directions of FEA combined with external field-driven MNRs are summarized.

J	Niessl, C; Hoffmann, S; Ullmann, T; Boulesteix, AL				Niessl, Christina; Hoffmann, Sabine; Ullmann, Theresa; Boulesteix, Anne-Laure			Explaining the optimistic performance evaluation of newly proposed methods: A cross-design validation experiment	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						benchmarking; overoptimism; performance; reproducibility; validation	DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS; PACKAGE	The constant development of new data analysis methods in many fields of research is accompanied by an increasing awareness that these new methods often perform better in their introductory paper than in subsequent comparison studies conducted by other researchers. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by conducting a systematic experiment that we call "cross-design validation of methods". In the experiment, we select two methods designed for the same data analysis task, reproduce the results shown in each paper, and then reevaluate each method based on the study design (i.e., datasets, competing methods, and evaluation criteria) that was used to show the abilities of the other method. We conduct the experiment for two data analysis tasks, namely cancer subtyping using multiomic data and differential gene expression analysis. Three of the four methods included in the experiment indeed perform worse when they are evaluated on the new study design, which is mainly caused by the different datasets. Apart from illustrating the many degrees of freedom existing in the assessment of a method and their effect on its performance, our experiment suggests that the performance discrepancies between original and subsequent papers may not only be caused by the nonneutrality of the authors proposing the new method but also by differences regarding the level of expertise and field of application. Authors of new methods should thus focus not only on a transparent and extensive evaluation but also on comprehensive method documentation that enables the correct use of their methods in subsequent studies.

J	Panthi, B; Dutta, S; Chandra, A				Panthi, Bhavana; Dutta, Saheb; Chandra, Amalendu			All-atom simulations of the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous medium: Nature of interactions, conformational stability and free energy diagrams for conformational transition of the protein	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						closed and open conformational states; direct and water-bridged hydrogen bonds; free energy diagram; intra- and inter-chain interactions; spike protein of SARS-COV-2	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; GLYCAN READER; AMBER; RECEPTOR; CHARMM; RBD; BINDING; ENTRY	The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 exists in two major conformational states, namely the 'open' and 'closed' states which are also known as the 'up' and 'down' states, respectively. In its open state, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the protein is exposed for binding with ACE2, whereas the spike RBD is inaccessible to ACE2 in the closed state of the protein. In the current work, we have performed all-atom microsecond simulations of the full-length trimeric spike protein solvated in explicit aqueous medium with an average system size of similar to 0.7 million atoms to understand the molecular nature of intra- and inter-chain interactions, water-bridged interactions between different residues that contribute to the stability of the open and closed states of the protein, and also the free energy landscape for transition between the open and closed states of the protein. We have also examined the changes of such interactions that are associated with switching from one state to the other through both unbiased and biased simulations at all-atom level with total run length of 4 mu s. Interestingly, after about 0.8 mu s of unbiased molecular dynamics run of the spike system in the open state, we observed a gradual transition of the monomeric chain (B) from open to its partially closed or down state. Initially the residues at the interface of chain B RBD in the open state spike protein were at non-hydrogen-bonding distances from the residues of chain C RBD. However, the two RBDs gradually came closer and finally the residue S459 of the RBD of chain B made a hydrogen bond with F374 of chain C in the last 200 ns of the simulation along with formation of a few more hydrogen bonds involving other residues. Since no transition from closed to the open state of the protein is observed in the present 1 mu s unbiased simulation of the closed state protein, the current study seems to suggest that the closed conformational state is preferred for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous medium. Furthermore, calculations of the free energy surface of the conformational transition from open (up) to the closed (down) state using a biased simulation method reveal a free energy barrier of similar to 3.20 kcal/mol for the transition of RBD from open to the closed state, whereas the barrier for the reverse process is found to be significantly higher.

The advantages of WMST are numerous. Not only does it produce estimates of treatment effect that can be meaningfully interpreted, but also has power advantages over competing methods when hazards are non-proportional (NPH). WMST, like RMST, is currently underutilized due to clinicians' lack of familiarity with tests comparing mean survival times and the lack of tools to facilitate trial design with this endpoint. The aim of this article is to provide investigators with insights and software to design trials with WMST as the primary endpoint. Functions for performing power and sample size calculations are provided in the survWMST package in R available on GitHub.

MethodsTreatments administered to groups [T] and [TO] had a common component, which is a botanical extract, Fernblock, with demonstrated photoprotective activity. ResultsIn total, 131 subjects were distributed randomly in the three groups, and followed up clinically at three separate time points, beginning of the study (t = 0) and after 6 and 12 months. Analysis of clinical data and examination using reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) revealed that group [T] and [TO] displayed decreased clinical AK and field cancerization parameters, including the number of new lesions, and reduced the need for additional interventions in these patients. RCM revealed normalization of the keratinocyte layer. Improvements in AK and field cancerization parameters were greatest in the group [TO], suggesting that topical and oral photoprotection improves the clinical and anatomical outcome compared to control conditions. ConclusionsThe combination of topical and oral immune photoprotection provides an advantage compared to topical photoprotection alone.

Managers' perceptions of authentic leadership, implementation of quality improvement, and organizational culture in Canadian hospitals.Results: 226 nurse managers participated. Our model estimations fit for the high-relational group and mixed group. Our model explained 50.7% and 39.5% variance in our outcome variable of patient satisfaction for the high-relational group and mixed group, respectively. Our model failed to fit the low-relational group.Conclusion: Authentic leadership and developmental/group hospital cultures improve quality management practices, quality of care and patient satisfaction. In organizations with low authentic leadership and hierarchical/rational cultures, strategies should target increasing authentic leadership and shifting to developmental cultures. Organizations with high authentic leadership and/or developmental/group cultures should target employee engagement, autonomy and teamwork.Impact: We examined how different combinations of authentic leadership and hospital culture influence the effects of quality management practices on quality improvement and patient satisfaction. Findings demonstrate that having both high authentic leadership and developmental or group hospital cultures are essential for quality improvement practices to enhance the quality of care and patient satisfaction. These organizations would benefit the most from systemic programs aimed at standardizing quality management practices as they have the culture and leadership to support these practices. For hospitals with hierarchical/rational cultures and/or low authentic leadership, enhancing hospital culture and leadership through leadership training and accreditation programs is critically needed.Patient or Public Contribution: The College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta contributed to this study by facilitating data collection and supporting the conduct of the study through messaging to its members.

Autumn outmigrants in brown trout (<i>Salmo trutta</i>) are not a demographic dead-end	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY			English	Article						biocomplexity; intraspecific; life-history; migration; salmonid; tactics; telemetry	CROSS-SPECIES AMPLIFICATION; JUVENILE COHO SALMON; LIFE-HISTORY; CHINOOK SALMON; ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; SALAR L.; MIGRATION; PATTERNS; GROWTH	Genetic identity analysis and PIT (passive integrated transponder) tagging were used to examine the freshwater return rates and phenotypic characteristics of n = 1791 downstream migrating juvenile Salmo trutta in the Burrishoole catchment (northwest Ireland) across the period September 2017 to December 2020. In this system, juveniles out-migrate (move from freshwater into brackish or marine habitats) in every month of the year, with distinct seasonal peaks in spring (March through June; mostly silvered smolts) and autumn (September through December; mostly younger, unsilvered fry or parr). Both types exhibited a sex-bias towards females, which was stronger in spring (78% females) than in autumn outmigrants (67%). Sixty-nine returning fish were matched back to previous juvenile outmigrants, and similar return rates were found for spring outmigrants (5.0%), autumn outmigrants (3.3%) and fish that out-migrated outside of spring or autumn (2.8%). Spring and autumn outmigrants returned at similar dates (typically mid to late July), but autumn fish were away for longer periods (median = 612 days; spring outmigrants = 104 days). Autumn outmigrants were 25% smaller than spring outmigrants at outmigration and 6% smaller on their return, and within both groups smaller/younger outmigrants spent longer away than larger/older outmigrants. Autumn outmigrants were more likely to return unsilvered as "slob" trout (84%) than spring outmigrants (31%), suggesting they make greater use of brackish habitats that might be safer, but less productive, than fully marine habitats. Nonetheless, both types also produced silvered "sea trout" (>= 1+ sea-age), implying neither is locked into a single life-history strategy. The findings emphasise that autumn outmigrants and the transitional habitats that support their persistence should not be overlooked in salmonid management and conservation.

Nanographene-Based Heterojunctions for High-Performance Organic Phototransistor Memory Devices	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						memory; nanographene; organic phototransistors; photosensitivity	ELECTRON-MOBILITY TRANSISTORS; THIN-FILMS; HYDROCARBONS; DETECTORS	Organic phototransistors can enable many important applications such as nonvolatile memory, artificial synapses, and photodetectors in next-generation optical communication and wearable electronics. However, it is still a challenge to achieve a big memory window (threshold voltage response increment V-th) for phototransistors. Here, a nanographene-based heterojunction phototransistor memory with large increment V-th responses is reported. Exposure to low intensity light (25.7 mu W cm(-2)) for 1 s yields a memory window of 35 V, and the threshold voltage shift is found to be larger than 140 V under continuous light illumination. The device exhibits both good photosensitivity (3.6 x 10(5)) and memory properties including long retention time (>1.5 x 10(5) s), large hysteresis (45.35 V), and high endurance for voltage-erasing and light-programming. These findings demonstrate the high application potential of nanographenes in the field of optoelectronics. In addition, the working principle of these hybrid nanographene-organic structured heterojunction phototransistor memory devices is described which provides new insight into the design of high-performance organic phototransistor devices.

The severity of symptoms and fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter regions underlying the CMS were assessed at baseline and 2-year follow-up.ResultsThe MBCT+PT group showed better outcomes after 2 years than the PT-alone group. The groups showed different FA changes: the MBCT+PT group showed decreased FA in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); the PT-alone group showed increased FA in the bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precuneus. Decreased white matter FA in the ACC, PCC, and precuneus was associated with improvements in the severity of state and trait symptoms in patients with panic disorder.ConclusionAlleviation of excessive white matter connectivity in the CMS after MBCT leads to improvements in clinical symptoms and trait vulnerability in patients with panic disorder. Our study provides new evidence for the long-term benefits of MBCT on white matter plasticity and its clinical applicability as a robust treatment for panic disorder.

The analysis is done via pinhole scans, that is, by decoupling the excitation area from the detection area and scanning the latter one. Knowing the size of the excited region, conclusions about the carrier transport in the in-plane layer of the QW can be drawn. In this study, a diffusion length Ld up to 12 mu m is observed at room temperature. Furthermore, the energy of the spectral peak is analyzed as a function of distance, showing a pronounced blueshift at the excitation center. An increase in distance to the injection region is accompanied by a redshift. The indication of peak energy is used to relate the drop of PL intensity with increasing radius to actual diffusion of charge carriers. In addition, temperature-dependent studies of the diffusion behavior are done, covering the range between 10 K and room temperature. No significant change of diffusion length can be seen with temperature, indicating that temperature dependencies of carrier lifetime and of mobility compensate each other.

Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms: Group A: TPLA (experimental group) and Group B: TURP (reference standard group). The primary endpoint was change in ejaculatory function (assessed by the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire - Ejaculatory function domain [EJ-MSHQ]) at 1 month after surgery. Secondary endpoints included comparison of visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, changes in sexual function (assessed using the five-item International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF-5]), change in International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS], change in quality of life score, and maximum urinary flow rate [Q(max)] improvement at 1-6 months, as appropriate.ResultsFifty-one patients (26 TPLA vs 25 TURP) were analysed. No differences in the perception of pain assessed by VAS and no differences in IIEF-5 score were found between the groups. The distribution of ejaculatory function assessed by the EJ-MSHQ remained unmodified after TPLA (P = 0.2), while a median 30% decrease in EJ-MSHQ score was observed after TURP (P = 0.01). Absence of antegrade ejaculation was reported in one patient in the TPLA group (vs 18 patients in the TURP group). A statistically significant difference between the treatment groups was found in terms of postoperative Q(max) (TPLA vs TURP: 15.2 [interquartile range 13.5-18.3] mL/s vs 26.0 [interquartile range 22.0-48.0] mL/s; P < 0.001). Both treatments significantly improved Q(max), with a mean 23.9 mL/s improvement after TURP (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.1-30.7) vs 6.0 mL/s after TPLA (95% CI 5.0-7.0), and IPSS, with a mean decrease of 11.6 (95% CI 9.7-13.5) vs 5.8 after TPLA (95% CI.2-9.6) with respect to baseline.ConclusionIn our study, TPLA preserved ejaculatory function in 96% of cases in addition to providing significant relief from BPO.

In addition, two chloroplast-localized DnaJ-like proteins, DJA5 and DJA6, function as specific iron donors in plastidial Fe/S protein biogenesis. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the impact of both the Hsp90 chaperone and the yeast DJA5-DJA6 homologs, the essential cytosolic Ydj1, and the mitochondrial Mdj1, on cellular iron-related processes. Despite severe phenotypes induced upon depletion of these crucial proteins, there was no critical in vivo impact on Fe/S protein biogenesis or iron regulation. Importantly, unlike the plant DJA5-DJA6 iron chaperones, Ydj1 and Mdj1 did not bind iron in vivo, suggesting that these proteins use zinc for function under normal physiological conditions.

Physiological function of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in fish	REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE			English	Review; Early Access						fish; immunoregulation; nutritional effect; recommended dosage; vitamin D-3	SALMO-SALAR L.; D-RECEPTOR; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; PLASMA TRANSPORT; CHOLECALCIFEROL; SUPPLEMENTATION; REQUIREMENT; METABOLISM; EVOLUTION; CALCIUM	Vitamin D (VD) is a steroid hormone, of which vitamin D-3 (VD3) is the main form in fish. Fish obtain VD3 majorly from diets, and VD3 has been widely used in aquatic feed as feed additive. As one of the essential nutrients, VD3 plays an indispensable role in the growth and health of fish. Due to the particularity of the fish living environment, the metabolic and physiological functions of VD3 in fish have some differences from those of mammals. This paper reviews the metabolic process of VD3 in fish, the main metabolites and vitamin D receptors, compares the differences in VD3 metabolism between fish and mammals, summarises the recommended dietary requirements for VD3 in several fish species, generalises the role of VD3 in fish growth performance, bone development, lipid metabolism, immune regulation, antioxidant and other potential physiological functions, as well as its synergistic effects with other nutrients. Future perspectives of VD3 application in aquaculture are proposed. Understanding the metabolic process and physiological function of VD3 is of great significance for extending VD3 application in the aquatic feed industry.

To this end, herein, a modular voxel-based methodology adaptable to any scale and with any soft transducer is presented. The methodology is implemented at the micrometer scale with a one-step fabrication process. An innovative gray-tone lithography method using the two-photon polymerization of photosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel is developed to print the voxels. Bending, compression, and twisting voxels are designed, printed, and characterized. A voxel consists of an isotropically shrinking active material reinforced adequately with a passive pattern. Each elementary voxel deforms along one degree of freedom and is a building block for superstructures able of advanced kinematics. With a side length of 40 mu m, the bending voxel achieves a bending angle of 25o or curvature of 10 mm-1. The compression voxel reaches an actuation strain of 40%, and the twisting voxel bends up to 18o. Advanced kinematics are demonstrated by printing complex structures composed of multiple elementary voxels.

Leading the path toward sustainable freshwater management: Reconciling challenges and opportunities in historical, hybrid, and novel ecosystem types	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER			English	Article						biodiversity conservation; ecosystem services; landscape planning; multi-objective spatial optimization; sustainability design	RIPARIAN BUFFER WIDTH; ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS; PROTECTED AREAS; SERVICES; FISH; FRAMEWORK; ENHANCE; STREAM; LAND; RESTORATION	Due to their importance for human development and well-being, freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened and modified in the world; a situation that is expected to intensify in the future. Freshwaters convey a mix of novel, historical, and hybrid systems, each with different values and opportunities for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. We argue that securing future access to freshwater services, while halting aquatic biodiversity loss, requires an evaluation of the opportunities offered and challenges imposed by each of these types of systems. Such an inventory can then build the basis to systematically plan restoration, conservation and management actions with the goal of harmonizing the multiplicity of co-occurring freshwater-related interests. Developing river basin management plans that integrate these multiple, often conflicting interests poses complex challenges, including (1) the current ecosystem condition that defines to a large extent what type of objectives can realistically be aimed at, (2) socioeconomic needs that limit our capacity to modify current conditions, for example, drinking water and energy provided by large dams, and (3) governance constraints related to managing large, often transboundary, river basins. Multi-objective management planning rooted in systematic conservation planning can help overcome these challenges. Consequently, we argue that adequate planning must play a key role when designing river basin management plans to make the most of the opportunities associated with local freshwater ecosystem types. We call for governments to embrace and promote a systematic approach to river basin management planning to create the urgently needed pan-global shift toward a sustainable biodiverse freshwater future.

However, how epithelial cells retain their epithelial traits and prevent malignant transformation is not well understood. Here, we report that the long noncoding RNA LITATS1 (LINC01137, ZC3H12A-DT) is an epithelial gatekeeper in normal epithelial cells and inhibits EMT in breast and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Transcriptome analysis identified LITATS1 as a TGF-beta target gene. LITATS1 expression is reduced in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and correlates with a favorable prognosis in breast and non-small cell lung cancer patients. LITATS1 depletion promotes TGF-beta-induced EMT, migration, and extravasation in cancer cells. Unbiased pathway analysis demonstrated that LITATS1 knockdown potently and selectively potentiates TGF-beta/SMAD signaling. Mechanistically, LITATS1 enhances the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TGF-beta type I receptor (T beta RI). LITATS1 interacts with T beta RI and the E3 ligase SMURF2, promoting the cytoplasmic retention of SMURF2. Our findings highlight a protective function of LITATS1 in epithelial integrity maintenance through the attenuation of TGF-beta/SMAD signaling and EMT.

Dental students' and faculty perception of online exams with e-invigilation in Cyprus	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION			English	Article; Early Access						COVID-19 pandemic; dental education; e-assessment; invigilation; online exams; student evaluation	SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT; EDUCATION; BENEFITS	Introduction: During the recent pandemic, e-learning and e-assessment methods have been implemented worldwide, providing opportunities for further implementation in the dental curriculum. This study aims to research the dental students' and dental faculty's perceptions of online exams with e-invigilation. Materials and Methods: Online questionnaires were developed and delivered, after three semesters of online exams, to all students and faculty. Descriptive statistics were performed, and answers were grouped into Principal Components (PC) using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Statistical significance was set at p <.05. Results: Two-hundred and sixty dental students (83.7%) and 24 dental faculty members (63.1%) answered the online questionnaires. PCA of students' responses revealed 4 PC, 'University support to students', 'Comparison between online and face-to-face exams', 'Preparation for the online exams' and 'Attitudes towards the technology used for the online exams'. PCA of faculty responses revealed 5 PC: 'Comparison between online and face-to-face exams', 'University support to faculty', 'Faculty attitudes towards the exam procedures', 'Human factors associated with the exam procedures' and 'Exam invigilation'. The overall satisfaction was high for both staff and students (higher for students and female staff). Students with previous experience in online exams scored more positively than first-year students. University support, process-related stress and e-invigilation were highlighted. Conclusions: The overall satisfaction with the e-exams was high, despite the technical problems, time-consuming processes and related stress. University support (training, IT support and resources) and mock exams emerged as important elements of online exams, as was the e-invigilation, which students perceived as efficient and non-intrusive.

Attention modulates neural measures associated with beat perception	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						attention; beat perception; electroencephalography; rhythm; steady-state evoked potential	SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; METER PERCEPTION; EMERGENT METER; RHYTHM; TEMPO; MUSIC; RESPONSES; LIMITS	A growing body of evidence suggests that steady-state evoked potentials may be a useful measure of beat perception, particularly when obtaining traditional, explicit measures of beat perception is difficult, such as with infants or non-human animals. Although attending to a stimulus is not necessary for most traditional applications of steady-state evoked potentials, it is unknown how attention affects steady-state evoked potentials that arise in response to beat perception. Additionally, most applications of steady-state evoked potentials to measure beat perception have used repeating rhythms or real music. Therefore, it is unclear how the steady-state response relates to the robust beat perception that occurs with non-repeating rhythms. Here, we used electroencephalography to record participants' brain activity as they listened to non-repeating musical rhythms while either attending to the rhythms or while distracted by a concurrent visual task. Non-repeating auditory rhythms elicited steady-state evoked potentials at perceived beat frequencies (perception was validated in a separate sensorimotor synchronization task) that were larger when participants attended to the rhythms compared with when they were distracted by the visual task. Therefore, although steady-state evoked potentials appear to index beat perception to non-repeating musical rhythms, this technique may be limited to when participants are known to be attending to the stimulus.

A plethora of new evidence suggests that these microbes play outsized roles in establishing synergistic polymicrobial infections at many different sites in the human body. Parvimonas micra is a prime example of such an organism. Despite being almost completely uncharacterized at the genetic level, it is one of the few species commonly detected in abundance at multiple mucosal sites experiencing either chronic or acute inflammatory diseases, and more recently, it has been proposed as a discriminating biomarker for multiple types of malignancies. In the absence of disease, P. micra is commonly found in low abundance, typically residing within the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. P. micra exhibits the typical features of an inflammophilic organism, meaning its growth actually benefits from active inflammation and inflammatory tissue destruction. In this mini-review, we will describe our current understanding of this underappreciated but ubiquitous pathobiont, specifically focusing upon the role of P. micra in polymicrobial inflammatory dysbiosis and cancer as well as the key emerging questions regarding its pathobiology. Through this timely work, we highlight Parvimonas micra as a significant driver of disease and discuss its unique position at the crossroads of dysbiosis and cancer.

The current study aimed to (a) develop an assessment tool measuring parental understanding and misperceptions about baby's sleep (PUMBA-Q); (b) validate the questionnaire using self-report and objective sleep measures. MethodsThere were 1,420 English-speaking caregivers (68.0% mothers, 46.8% of children being females, mean age 12.3 months), who has completed online self-reported questionnaires. The PUMBA-Q, which was developed for this study, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS) and Maternal Cognitions about Infant Sleep Questionnaire (MCISQ) were included to evaluate participant's thoughts on their own or child's sleep. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) was collected to access participant's subjective insomnia severity. Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire-Revised (BISQ-R) was used to assess parental-reported child sleep. Auto-videosomnography was used to record child's sleep. ResultsExploratory factor analysis indicated the best fit with a 4-factor model using 23 items (RMSEA = .039). The four subscales were labeled: (a) Misperceptions about parental intervention; (b) Misperceptions about feeding; (c) Misperceptions about child's sleep; and (d) General anxiety of parents. Internal consistency was adequate (Cronbach's alpha = .86). PUMBA-Q scores were significantly associated with MCISQ (r = .64, p < .01), DBAS (r = .36, p < .01), ISI (r = .29, p < .01), BISQ-R (r = .-49, p < .01), objective child's total sleep time (r = -.24, p < .01) and objective number of parental nighttime visits (r = .26, p < .01). ConclusionsThe results demonstrated that PUMBA-Q 23 is a valid assessment tool for parental cognitions of child sleep. The link between parental cognitions and child sleep highlights the importance of managing parental cognitions about child sleep when treating pediatric sleep problems.

The authors have declared that they have no competing or potential conflicts of interest.Key points Parental cognition is an important factor associated with pediatric sleep problems. PUMBA-Q was developed to be a culturally inclusive measure of parental cognition. Associations between parental misperceptions about child's sleep and parental nighttime visits were found in our study, and higher frequency of nighttime visits was positively related to the number of awakenings of the child measured by auto-videosomnography. This association can impact parental sleep quality as childcare often disrupts parental sleep opportunity. We found that PUMBA-Q has adequate psychometric properties and significant association with child sleep and parental nighttime behaviors using auto-videosomnography. Our findings add importance to focus more on assessing and intervening on parental factors to manage pediatric sleep problems.		52	0	0	3	3	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0021-9630	1469-7610		J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC	J.

The aim of this work was to assess the utility of 3D spheroid PHHs to study induction of important cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and drug transporters. The 3D spheroid PHHs from three different donors were treated for 4 days with rifampicin, dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, efavirenz, omeprazole, or beta-naphthoflavone. Induction of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/ABCB1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2)/ABCC2, ABCG2, organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1)/SLC22A1, SLC22A7, SLCO1B1, and SLCO1B3 were evaluated at mRNA and protein levels. Enzyme activity of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 were also assessed. Induction of CYP3A4 protein and mRNA correlated well for all donors and compounds and had a maximal induction of five- to sixfold for rifampicin, which closely correlates to induction observed in clinical studies. Rifampicin induced the mRNA of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 by 9- and 12-fold, whereas the protein levels of these CYPs reached 2- and 3-fold induction, respectively. Rifampicin induced CYP2C9 protein by 1.4-fold, whereas the induction of CYP2C9 mRNA was over 2-fold in all donors. Rifampicin induced ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCG2 by 2-fold. In conclusion, 3D spheroid PHHs is a valid model to investigate mRNA and protein induction of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and this model provides a solid basis to study induction of CYPs and transporters, which translates to clinical relevance.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study enrolled 203 745 women who gave birth between January and December 2020 in Japan. The participants were classified into two groups based on their history of myomectomy (open/laparoscopic) to investigate fertility treatment, delivery information, obstetric complications, maternal treatment, infant information, fetal appendages, obstetric history, underlying disease, infectious disease, drugs used, and case information regarding maternal and infant death. ResultsIn total, 1161 pregnant women had a history of myomectomy and 202 584 did not. Compared with the nonmyomectomy group, the myomectomy group had a higher occurrence rate of uterine rupture (0.9% vs 0.06%, P < 0.01) and placenta accreta (1.5% vs 0.5%, P < 0.01). In addition, history of myomectomy (odds ratio [OR], 2.62 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.500-4.226]; P < 0.001) was found to be an independent factor for placenta accrete and uterine rupture (OR, 14.4 [95% CI, 6.75-27.02]; P < 0.001). Furthermore, myomectomy increased the risk of uterine rupture by 14 times. ConclusionPostmyomectomy pregnancy may increase the risk of placenta accreta and uterine rupture.

We conduct a series of population projections with different assumptions on the proportion of refugees that may return to Ukraine. Our projections show that if past demographic trends continue, Ukraine's population is projected to decline by one-sixth over the next two decades and become older. These trends are largely driven by past and current demographic developments: continued very low fertility and large-scale emigration at the turn of the century. With war casualties and a large portion of the Ukrainian population seeking safety abroad from the conflict, the country's population is projected to decline by one-third. The decline would be even larger among the working-age population and children. Russia's invasion has not only led to immense human and economic costs in Ukraine in the present but also carries long-term demographic repercussions.

Broadscale hydraulic modelling frameworks are often able to employ more complex models, but are typically limited to homogenous decision-making to ensure standardised outputs across large regions. Conversely, small-scale hydraulic modelling frameworks tend to better integrate local-scale features but can be computationally expensive to scale up beyond a regional view. Improvements to the broadscale hydraulic model framework through the incorporation of defence systems yield a more accurate representation of fluvial flood risk. This study incorporates defences in Kuala Lumpur, yielding a reduction in our estimates of fluvial flood extent by around 40%. The results of this study are validated against a set of high-quality observations, demonstrating the capability of the model framework in capturing flood risk in more than 95% of known flood risk zones in the city. Incorporating defence infrastructure using data-driven decision making and existing functionality in the hydraulic model could be automated in future model builds. This new approach bridges the gap between local-scale model frameworks and the broadscale, homogenous 2D hydraulic modelling studies.

Concomitant coronary artery bypass and aortic valve replacement is considered the gold standard treatment in surgical candidates. However, limited evidence is available regarding the role of coronary revascularization in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). How to evaluate CAD severity in patients with AS, whether percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) needs to be performed and what is the timing for revascularization to minimize procedural risks, remains matters of debate. The aim of this review is to summarize epidemiology, diagnostic tools and possible options for CAD management in patients undergoing TAVI with specific focus on the pros and the cons of the different timing of PCI.

Interpreting alignment to the EAT-Lancet diet using dietary intakes of lactating mothers in rural Western Kenya	MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION			English	Article						diet cost; EAT-Lancet reference diet; healthy diet; Kenya; lactating mothers' diet; mothers' body mass index; mothers' energy intake	FOOD-PRICES; QUALITY	The EAT-Lancet reference diet intends to be good for planetary and human health. We compared single multiple pass method 24-h dietary intake of mothers (n = 242) from a cross-sectional study in Western Kenya to the recommended range of intake of 11 EAT-Lancet food groups (e.g., 0-100 g/day legumes; maximum score 11), defining alignment two ways: daily intake among food groups where a minimum intake of 0 g was either acceptable or unacceptable. Ordinal logistic regression models assessed associations between alignment and body mass index (BMI). Cost of mothers' diets and hypothetical diets within recommended ranges (lower bounds >0 g) were estimated using food price data from markets within the mothers' locality. Mean energy intake was 1827 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1731-1924) kcal/day. Relative to the EAT-Lancet diet, mothers' diets were on average higher for grains; within recommendations for tubers, fish, beef and dairy; closer to lower bounds for chicken, eggs, legumes and nuts; and lower for fruits and vegetables. Mean (95% CI) alignment scores were 8.2 (8.0-8.3) when 0 g intakes were acceptable and 1.7 (1.6-1.9) otherwise. No significant associations were found between alignment and BMI. Mothers' diets and hypothetical diets within recommended ranges averaged 184.6 KES (1.6 USD) and 357.5 KES (3.0 USD)/person/day, respectively. Lactating mothers' diets were not diverse and diverged from the reference diet when an intake of 0 g was considered unacceptable. Lower bound intakes of 0 g for micronutrient-dense food groups are inappropriate in food-insecure populations. It would likely cost more than mothers currently spend to tailor their diets to the EAT-Lancet reference diet.

The four inputs are: irradiation time, initial dye concentration, pH of the initial solution, and catalyst loading. The ANN model with 20 hidden neurons and with R-2 of 0.999 shows minimum values of the performance metrics of 0.169, 2.020, 1.531, and 0.215 for the mean square error, the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, and the mean absolute percentage error, respectively. The optimized ANN configuration of 4-20-1 shows a good fit with the experimental data. The result shows that the sunlight irradiation time has the main impact on rhodamine B degradation at similar to 55 %.	[Reddy, P.

These three components sum up to one. Therefore, they can be used to portray the community structure in a ternary diagram.Since the identification of community-level patterns is an essential step to investigate the main drivers of species coexistence, the ternary diagram of functional diversity can be used to relate different facets of diversity to community assembly processes more exhaustively than looking only at one index at a time.The value of the proposed diversity decomposition is demonstrated by the analysis of actual abundance data on plant assemblages sampled in grazed and ungrazed grasslands in Tuscany (Central Italy).

This study looks to understand parental knowledge, attitudes and management practices towards constipation in children with intellectual disabilities and/or autism. MethodsA cross-sectional online survey developed with patient facing organisations was circulated to parents of children with intellectual disabilities and/or autism using an exponential and non-discriminatory snowballing method for recruitment. A smaller sample were purposively sampled for their in-depth experiences. ResultsOf 68 responses, people were open to discussing constipation and knowledgeable about risk factors. In the qualitative interviews, of 15 parents, they wanted to be treated as an expert in their child's care. They desired a service that was more responsive when in difficulty. While wanting more information about medication options, parents want a more holistic approach. ConclusionsServices need more emphasis on holistic management. Listening to parents and treating them as experts is important.

Lived experiences of Oxford House residents prescribed medication-assisted treatment	JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						buprenorphine; methadone; Oxford House; recovery housing; substance use	METHADONE-MAINTENANCE TREATMENT; SUBSTANCE-ABUSE; RECOVERY DEFINITIONS; SOCIAL IDENTITY; DRUG-ADDICTION; SETTINGS; FAMILIES; ALCOHOL; STIGMA	Qualitative studies have examined the recovery experiences of individuals prescribed medication-assisted treatment (MAT), including their experiences within treatment facilities. However, the literature lacks qualitative studies exploring the recovery process of individuals prescribed MAT while living in recovery housing, such as Oxford House (OH). The purpose of this study was to explore how OH residents, who are prescribed MAT, make sense of recovery. The fact that OHs are drug-free recovery housing is what makes the issue of using MATs potentially contentious in these settings. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to document the lived experiences of individuals prescribed MAT in OH. The sample included: five women and three men, prescribed either methadone or Suboxone, that were living in an OH in the United States. Participants were interviewed on four topics: their recovery process, their transition to OH, and their experience living in and outside of an OH. Analysis of results followed the recommendations for IPA from Smith, Flowers, and Larkin. Four general themes emerged from the data: Recovery Process, Managing Logistics of MAT Utilization, Personal Development, and Familial Values. In conclusion, individuals prescribed MAT did benefit from living in an OH to manage their recovery as well as stay compliant with their medication.

One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F horizontal ellipsis F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non-polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA-NC) at aggregating conditions. Even though, the both polymorphs show distinct tricolor luminescence switching on the action of mechanical force, fumigation of ground crystals with solvent vapor resulted in the formation of a more thermodynamically favorable 4FDSA-NC form. The work demonstrates the effect of supramolecular interactions assisted conformational changes in tuning the unique mechanofluorochromic characteristics of the polymorphic crystals.	[Suresh, Sumi K.

A thorough characterization of this method is given in this paper, and its physical origins are investigated. In particular, these measurements show that laser direct writing of such mirrors has a reversible and a permanent component. The reversible process originates from the thermal expansion of the surface and allows a simple yet precise way to temporarily modify the shape of the mirror. Scanning electron microscope cross-sectional images suggest that the permanent part of the nanostructuring process is due to thermally induced pore formation and enlargement in the tantalum oxide layers of the used dielectric mirror.

Therefore, Li plating regulation and morphology control are proposed to address this issue. Specifically, a Li plating-reversible graphite anode is achieved via a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to successfully regulate the Li plating with high reversibility over high-rate cycling. The evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) before and after Li plating is deeply investigated to explore the interaction between the lithiation behavior and electrochemical interface polarization. Under the fact that Li plating contributes 40 % of total lithiation capacity, the stable LiF-rich SEI renders the anode a higher average Coulombic efficiency (99.9 %) throughout 240 cycles and a 99.95 % reversibility of Li plating. Consequently, a self-made 1.2-Ah LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 | graphite pouch cell delivers a competitive retention of 84.4 % even at 7.2 A (6 C) after 150 cycles. This work creates an ingenious bridge between the graphite anode and Li plating, for realizing the high-performance fast-charging batteries.

We investigated the links between direct anthropogenic pressures, socioeconomic settings, and the coverage of vertebrate taxa by China's PA network,and indicated that high socioeconomic status and low levels of human pressure correlate with high species coverage, with threatened mammals more effectively conserved than reptiles or amphibians. Positive links between conservation outcomes and socioeconomic progress appear linked to local livelihood improvements triggering positive perceptions of local PAs-aided further by ecological compensation and tourism schemes introduced in wealthy areas and reinforced by continued positive conservation outcomes. Socioeconomic development of China's less developed regions might assist regional PA efficiency and achievement of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, while also addressing potential shortcomings from an insufficient past focus on socioeconomic impacts for biodiversity conservation.

In this work, a series of K-modified MoS2/Al2O3 catalysts with variable K/Mo ratios were prepared to elucidate the promotion role of potassium through IR spectroscopy studies. CO adsorption followed by IR spectroscopy shows that after potassium addition the number of accessible edge sites of MoS2 slabs is decreased. Meanwhile, the downward shift of v(CO/MoS2) indicates that the presence of potassium increases the electronic density of Mo atoms. This electronic effect activates terminal S atoms, favoring their reaction with CO to form COS at lower temperature than in absence of K. Additionally, conversely to the case of MoS2/Al2O3 catalysts, little or even no formate species are observed on K-modified MoS2 catalysts during IR operando studies, implying a change of the WGS reaction route that would explain the beneficial effect of K on MoS2 edge site activity.

Association between adolescents' socioeconomic status and working memory updating functioning: Role of parental educational involvement	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE			English	Article; Early Access						parental educational involvement; socioeconomic status; working memory updating	ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; FAMILY; HOMEWORK; INTELLIGENCE; CAPACITY; PERSPECTIVE; STUDENT; FATHERS; AGE	Family socioeconomic status (SES) is positively associated with executive functioning. This study tested whether parental educational involvement mediates this association. Two hundred and sixty, 12-15-year-old adolescents completed working memory updating (WMU) and general intelligence tasks, and questionnaires on SES and parental educational involvement. SES and WMU ability were positively associated; there was no difference between the fathers and mothers for three types of educational involvement. The mothers' behavioural involvement positively mediated the SES-WM updating association, whereas a negative mediation was observed for the mothers' intellectual involvement. The fathers' educational involvement did not play a significant mediating role. These results might inform interventions targeting educational involvement for enhancing the cognitive development of children from low SES families.

The goal of our study was to test if quercetin had antiaging and stimulating effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) immune cells in vitro in the presence of concanavalin a, PBMCs were isolated from healthy elderly and young people and cultured in a complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium supplemented with quercetin. Cell proliferation was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay after a 48-h incubation period. Spectrophotometric assays were used to assess oxidative biomarkers (proteins carbonyl [PC], malondialdehydes [MDA], and reduced glutathione [GSH]). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was used to determine the amount of interleukin (IL)-2 released. A Griess reagent was used to investigate inducible nitrite oxide synthase (iNOS) activity. When compared to young control cells, aged PBMCs had lower proliferation potency, lower IL-2 and NO release, and higher MDA and PC levels. Importantly, quercetin-treated aged PBMCs have a high proliferative response comparable to young cells, restored iNOS activity, and increased levels of GSH antioxidant defences. In comparison to untreated aged PBMCs, treated PBMCs have lower lipo-oxidative damage but higher PC levels. Quercetin may be used as a promising dietary vaccinal adjuvant in the elderly, it has significant effects in reducing immunosenescence hallmarks, as well as mitigating the lipo-oxidative stress in PBMCs cells.

Host-guest inclusion complexes have modest size, and it is possible to get convergent results fast, achieving greater certainty for the obtained thermodynamic properties. Cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives can be used as drug carriers that can boost stability, solubility, and bioavailability of physiologically active substances. A simple and effective approach for assessing the binding properties of CD complexes that are critical in the early stages of drug and formulation development is needed to fully understand the process of CD and guest molecules' complex formation. In this work, TDA was successfully used to rapidly determine interaction parameters, including binding constant and stoichiometry, between beta-CD and folic acid (FA) along with the diffusivities of the free FA and its complex with beta-CD. Additionally, the FA diffusion coefficient obtained by TDA was compared to the results previously obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance. Affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE) was also used to compare the binding constants obtained by different methods. The results showed that the binding constants obtained by ACE were somewhat lower than those obtained by the two TDA procedures.

At optimized growth conditions, the dead biomass of Cladosporium sp. and Penicillium sp. has removed more than 99% of the supplemented Cr(VI). The kinetic study outcomes evidenced that the present fungal Cr(VI) biosorption is best fitting with the pseudo-first-order model with higher R-2 values (i.e., 0.70-0.95) than that of the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.02-0.73).

Among alternatives, host defense peptides (HDPs) have attracted great interest for their ability to preserve food samples from contamination without altering their quality, taste, and organoleptic properties. Recently, we evaluated the applicability of ApoB-derived peptides as novel food bio-preservatives and demonstrated their ability to prevent chicken meat sample contamination when immobilized on chitosan films. To perform a further step towards the applicability of these peptides in the food field, here we evaluated peptides biosafety and digestibility. To do this, we used a multidisciplinary approach including the evaluation of the peptides' toxicity and antimicrobial activity, the analysis of resistance phenotype development, an in silico prediction of the peptides' susceptibility to proteases and the evaluation of the peptides' stability in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. ApoB-derived peptides were found to be nontoxic when tested on human gastric carcinoma cells SNU-1 and on human colon-rectal adenocarcinoma cells HT-29, and not to induce resistance phenotype in Salmonella strains. Bioinformatic analyses showed that the peptides are susceptible to several proteases, as also confirmed by experiments in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. Altogether these findings open interesting perspectives to the future applicability of ApoB-derived peptides as novel food biopreservatives.

FLCN acts as a negative regulator of TFEB and TFE3 transcription factors, master controllers of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, by enabling their phosphorylation by the mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1). We have previously shown that deletion of Tfeb rescued the renal cystic phenotype of kidney-specific Flcn KO mice. Using Flcn/Tfeb/Tfe3 double and triple KO mice, we now show that both Tfeb and Tfe3 contribute, in a differential and cooperative manner, to kidney cystogenesis. Remarkably, the analysis of BHD patient-derived tumor samples revealed increased activation of TFEB/TFE3-mediated transcriptional program and silencing either of the two genes rescued tumorigenesis in human BHD renal tumor cell line-derived xenografts (CDXs). Our findings demonstrate in disease-relevant models that both TFEB and TFE3 are key drivers of renal tumorigenesis and suggest novel therapeutic strategies based on the inhibition of these transcription factors.

Its purpose is to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively, the presence of elemental species in a sample. This is accomplished through fitting the acquired data to a Gaussian model, identifying which XRF lines and associated elements are present. As a result, 2D images of cumulative count-rate maps associated with each element are produced. This procedure is not trivial to apply efficiently in a workflow, as it requires the user to be able to set a series of parameters (e.g., beam energy, background subtraction, etc.) on top of selecting XRF lines under investigation. Furthermore, users should easily and swiftly be able to change setup parameters and evaluate the effects on the results. In the present work, we introduce a web-based application that allows users to load the XRF data, setup a fit and inspect the results interactively within a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that enables easily going back and forth from setup to result inspection. In particular, it is possible to quickly view the count-rate maps and curve fitting simultaneously, on any single pixel spectra present in the images. The web-application can be accessed locally by a web-browser, but runs remotely on a cloud, freeing from the need of installing any software and will be made publicly available in the near future. At present, it has been designed to work on both conventional and sparse XRF data such as Compressive Sensing, in an embarrassingly parallel manner.

Long magnets can satisfy the homogeneity requirements but require considerable superconducting material. These designs result in large, heavy, and costly systems that aggravate as field strength increases. Furthermore, the tight temperature tolerance of niobium titanium magnets adds instability to the system and requires operation at liquid helium temperature. These issues are crucial factors in the disparity of MR density and field strength use across the globe. Low-income settings show reduced access to MRI, especially to high field strengths. This article summarizes the proposed modifications to MRI superconducting magnet design and their impact on accessibility, including compact, reduced liquid helium, and specialty systems. Reducing the amount of superconductor inevitably entails shrinking the magnet size, resulting in higher field inhomogeneity. This work also reviews the state-of-the-art imaging and reconstruction methods to overcome this issue. Finally, we summarize the current and future challenges and opportunities in the design of accessible MRI.

We have previously reported a moderate reduction in seizure frequency after treatment with a modified Atkins diet. This study aimed to see whether dietary therapy impacts patients' health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In a randomized controlled design, we compared the change in self-reported HRQOL among adults with difficult-to-treat epilepsy after a 12-week diet intervention. Thirty-nine patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy (age = 16-65 years) were randomized to eat a modified Atkins diet with maximum 16 g of carbohydrate per day (diet group, n = 19) or to continue eating habitual diet (control group, n = 20). No changes to the other epilepsy treatments were allowed. Patient-reported HRQOL was assessed with the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-89 (QOLIE-89). The diet group experienced a statistically significant improvement in mean total score of QOLIE-89 of 10 points compared to controls (p = .002). Moreover, although not statistically significant when using a cutoff of 50% seizure reduction, our data suggest an association between diet-induced reduction in seizure frequency and improvement in HRQOL. The improvement in HRQOL was not associated with diet-induced weight reduction.

But practical understanding of the charge transfer mechanism at the electronic level of catalysis process has remained elusive. Here, it is reported that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles can self-accommodate into Fe3O4 and carbon support (Ru-Fe3O4/C) through the electronic metal-support interaction, resulting in robust catalytic activity toward the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical calculations demonstrate that electronic perturbation occurred in the Ru-Fe3O4/C, and that charge redistribution directly influenced adsorption behavior during the catalytic process. The Ru-O bond formed by orbital mixing changes the charge state of the surface Ru site, enabling more electrons to flow to H intermediates (H*) for favorable adsorption. The weak binding strength of the Ru-O bond also reinforces the anti-bonding character of H* with a more favorable recombination of H* species into H-2 molecules. Because of this satisfactory catalytic mechanism, the Ru-Fe3O4/C supported nanoparticle catalyst demonstrated better HER activity and robust stability than the benchmark commercial Pt/C benchmark in alkaline media.

However, the establishment of preclinical models that enable fully recapitulating the tumor microenvironment remains challenging owing to its intrinsic complexity. Recent progress in engineering techniques has allowed the development of a new generation of in vitro preclinical models that can recreate complex in vivo tumor microenvironments and accurately predict drug responses, including spheroids, organoids, and tumor-on-a-chip. These biomimetic 3D tumor models are of particular interest as they pave the way for better understanding of cancer biology and accelerating the development of new anticancer therapeutics with reducing animal use. Here, the recent advances in developing these in vitro platforms for cancer modeling and preclinical drug screening, focusing on incorporating hydrogels are reviewed to reconstitute physiologically relevant microenvironments. The combination of spheroids/organoids with microfluidic technologies is also highlighted to better mimic in vivo tumors and discuss the challenges and future directions in the clinical translation of such models for drug screening and personalized medicine.

However, our understanding of the precise mechanisms behind music-induced analgesia (MIA) remains poor. The positive emotional state induced by music is one of the key components explaining MIA. To test this possibility and reveal its neural correlates, the present study applied nociceptive laser stimuli to 28 healthy participants when their liked or disliked songs were played as background music, or when they were resting in silence. Differences among conditions were quantified by self-reports of pain intensity and unpleasantness, as well as brain activations in response to acute laser stimuli. As expected, liked music significantly lowered pain ratings to acute painful stimuli compared to disliked music and no music. Consistent with this observation, brain activations in response to acute painful stimuli were deceased within brain areas encoding sensory components of pain, such as the right precentral and postcentral gyri (PreCG/PoCG), brain areas related to affective components of pain, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral putamen, and brain areas associated with motor control and avoidance reactions to pain, such as the left cerebellum, when liked music was played in the background in comparison to disliked music. Importantly, the relationship between music listening and differences in pain ratings of two music conditions was mediated by the magnitude of right PreCG/PoCG and left cerebellum activations. These findings deepened our understanding of the analgesic benefits of background liked music, a property relevant to clinical applications.

J	Piller, C				Piller, Christian			Glad to be alive: How we can compare a person's existence and her non-existence in terms of what is better or worse for this person	ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY			English	Article; Early Access							PEOPLE	This paper defends the claim that if a person P exists, there can be true positive comparisons between P's existence and P's never having existed at all in terms of what is better or worse for P. If correct, this view will have significant implications for various fundamental issues in population ethics. I try to show how arguments to the contrary fail to take note of a general ambiguity in comparisons when compared alternatives contain their own different standards (or, in the case of non-existence, a lack thereof) on which to base these comparisons. After having answered arguments against the possibility of making positive comparisons, the paper develops a positive account of how to make existence/non-existence comparisons in terms of personal value whilst accepting that a person's non-existence fails to make any contact with the relevant categories of personal value. The guiding idea is the following: When some item satisfies some relevant standard, we can, I argue, infer that it satisfies this standard better than something that fails to satisfy this standard (be this failure due to empirical or conceptual reasons).

JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS			English	Article							EXPERIENCE; MODEL	Problems with positive emotion are an important component of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with competing perspectives as to why. The global model suggests that people with PTSD experience a relatively permanent shift in their capacity for positive emotion regardless of context, whereas the context-specific model posits access to the full repertoire of positive emotion that only becomes reduced during exposure to trauma reminders. We tested the global versus context-specific models using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Trauma-exposed adult community members (N = 80) with (n = 39) and without diagnosed PTSD completed 3 days of EMA (n = 2,158 observations). Participants with PTSD reported lower average momentary levels of positive emotion, B = -0.947, 95% CI [-1.35, -0.54], p < .001, and positive situations, B = -0.607, 95% CI [-1.16, -0.05], p = .032, and more thinking about trauma reminders, B = 0.360, 95% CI [0.21, 0.51], p < .001. There was no between-group difference in positive emotion reactivity (degree of positive emotion derived from positive situations), B = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.14], p = .635. Increased thinking about trauma reminders predicted lower momentary levels of positive emotion, B = -0.55, 95% CI [-0.83, -0.26], p < .001, but not reactivity, B = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.35, 0.40], p = .906, irrespective of PTSD status. Findings supported the global model and were inconsistent with the context-specific model. This study helps clarify positive emotional functioning in trauma-exposed adults and highlights future directions to better understand problems with positive emotion in PTSD.

Although colloquially Ae. albopictus is called an 'invasive species', it is not considered 'invasive' and therefore to be controlled according to the European Union (EU) Environmental and Nature Protection Act since evidence of displacement of native species is missing. To test the competitive potential of Ae. albopictus towards mosquito species native to Germany, laboratory experiments were conducted with larvae of this species and indigenous Cx. pipiens complex species/biotypes. First instar larvae of Ae. albopictus and of one of the native taxa were exposed to different temperatures and fed with different food sources. The ratio of individuals developing into adults as well as the time the larvae needed for development were taken as a measure of competitive outcome. In addition, the size of emerging adults was compared between control and experimental groups. Regarding developmental time, no significant differences were found between treatments and controls while significant differences were found regarding developmental rate and average wing size of individuals. Because no evidence of competitive repression of the native species was found, Ae. albopictus cannot be included in the EU list of invasive species.

In the last 30 years, the use of chemotaxonomy has improved the capability to detect phytoplankton community composition in terms of chemofunctional groups, especially for small size species requiring specific expertise and techniques, as well as time-consuming observation with light microscope. In this study, the temporal variability of chemotaxonomic functional groups has been investigated in surface waters of a LTER station in the Gulf of Naples over 12-year weekly sampling activities (2003-2015). Data reveal increasing trends in the percentage contribution of diatoms, prasinophytes, cryptophytes to the total phytoplankton biomass, while other groups show a decreasing trend. Nevertheless, strong differences in the intervals of periodicity for each chemofunctional group have emerged, both in terms of timescale and strength of periodicity over time, implying that temporal dynamics of groups were not stationary over the time and that they have different relationships with environmental variability. Our results contribute to enrich scientific knowledge on the ecology of this LTER site and underline the importance of chemotaxonomy as a monitoring tool in coastal marine systems.

Materials and MethodsA total of 316 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged >45 years were recruited in this study, and data on demographics, medical history, lifestyle characteristics and SLEs were collected. The cognitive status of patients was evaluated with a battery of cognitive function scales. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the risk and protective factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). ResultsParticipants, including 217 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with MCI and 99 patients without MCI, were enrolled in the current study. Among the SLEs, the death of an offspring or parent (odds ratio [OR] 1.994, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.017-3.908) was a risk factor for MCI after adjustment for age and education level. In the subgroup of participants aged <60 years, the death of an offspring or parent (OR 2.731, 95% CI 1.119-6.665) and financial difficulty (OR 22.205, 95% CI 4.365-112.966) were risk factors for the development of MCI, whereas high working pressure (OR 0.154, 95% CI 0.048-0.495) and career changes (OR 0.324, 95% CI 0.124-0.847) were protective factors for MCI. ConclusionsThese data suggested that SLEs were associated with cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adverse life events, such as the death of an offspring or parent, were risk factors for cognitive impairment, whereas high work pressure in middle-aged people was a protective factor against cognitive impairment.

Impact of monoclonal antibody therapy for head and neck cancer on end-of-life care utilization and costs	HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK			English	Article; Early Access						end-of-life care; head and neck cancer; health care costs; health care utilization	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; RECURRENT; PEMBROLIZUMAB; CHEMOTHERAPY; NIVOLUMAB; CETUXIMAB; SURVIVAL	BackgroundThe impact of monoclonal antibody therapy (mAB) for advanced head and neck cancer on end-of-life health care utilization and costs has yet to be adequately studied. MethodsRetrospective cohort study of patients aged 65 and over with a diagnosis of head and neck cancer between 2007 and 2017 within the SEER-Medicare registry assessing the impact of mAB therapy (i.e., cetuximab, nivolumab, or pembrolizumab) on end-of-life health care utilization (ED visits, inpatient admissions, ICU admissions, and hospice claims) and costs. ResultsOf 12 544 patients with HNC, 270 (2.2%) utilized mAB therapy at the end-of-life period. On multivariable analyses adjusting for demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, there was a significant association between mAB therapy and emergency department visits (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8, p = 0.01) and healthcare costs (beta: $9760, 95% CI: 5062-14 458, p < 0.01). ConclusionsmAB use is associated with higher emergency department utilization and health care costs potentially due to infusion-related and drug toxicity expenses.

Comparing estimates of census and effective population size in an endangered amphibian	ANIMAL CONSERVATION			English	Article; Early Access						Ambystoma bishopi; conservation genetics; demographic model; effective population size; endangered species recovery; flatwoods salamander	LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; N-E; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; AMBYSTOMA-CINGULATUM; EFFECTIVE NUMBER; SINGLE-SAMPLE; OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS; FLATWOODS SALAMANDER; BREEDING AMPHIBIANS; GENETIC-STRUCTURE	The field of conservation has seen a shift in focus from monitoring trends in census population size to trends in `effective' population size. Numerous genetic methods exist for estimating effective population size, resulting in uncertainty among conservation practitioners as to which methods are most appropriate when conducting population assessments or evaluating recovery efforts. Demographic approaches offer a promising avenue to provide a link between census and effective population size using life-history information, but rarely do studies have all three sources of data (genetic, demographic, life history) necessary to perform an explicit evaluation of their performance. Using data from a long-term study of reticulated flatwoods salamanders (Ambystoma bishopi) in western Florida, USA, we assessed the magnitude of temporal variation in census population sizes oNTHORN and the effective number of breeders Nbo THORN of two breeding populations to (1) document changes in the number of breeding adults over the 9-year study duration, (2) determine whether N and Nb provide similar information about population size and trends and (3) compare alternative demographic and genetic approaches for estimating Nb. We found that genetic estimates of bN b, particularly if averaged across multiple estimation methods, closely tracked spatiotemporal variation in N. Demographic estimates of Nb also closely tracked N but were sensitive to the assumed variance in reproductive success. In the absence of genetic information, detailed knowledge of mating systems and the environmental factors that skew reproductive contributions appear necessary for demographic Nb to reliably inform management decisions. In these populations, bN b appears too small (<40 individuals) to confer long-term genetic resilience, highlighting the importance of restoring landscape connectivity and indicating that caution must be taken when sourcing animals for reintroduction efforts. More generally, our study reveals insights into the utility of alternative Nb estimation methods in guiding recovery efforts of threatened and endangered species.	[Brooks, G. C.; Haas, C.

One reason was to reduce the risk of food allergy. The earlier introduction of complementary feeding is now advised. Our aim was to study adherence to current recommendations and whether the time of introduction changed between 2003 and 2018.Methods Data were obtained from two prospective, longitudinal, population-based cohort studies of children born in 2003 (n = 4987) and in 2018 (n = 3936). Parents answered comparable questionnaires when the children were 6 and 12 months old.Results At 6 months, in the 2018 cohort, eggs were introduced to 67.2% of the infants, fish to 78.9%, gluten to 89.1%, cow's milk to 76.6% and peanuts to 46.2%. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, introduction of complementary feeding with gluten, fish and eggs was made significantly earlier in the 2018 cohort compared with the 2003 cohort, adjusted for heredity, own allergic disease and parental educational level (p < 0.01).Conclusion Complementary feeding with eggs, fish and gluten was introduced earlier in infants born in 2018 compared with 2003, possibly reducing the risk of developing allergic disease. Current recommendations from child welfare centres are being followed.

MethodsThe articles were searched using PsycINFO, Medline, PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane. Two independent investigators critically appraised eligible studies. The PRISMA guidelines and checklist were used. The possibility of risk of bias was assessed using a tool to assess the quality of randomised control trials (RCT) and non-RCT studies. A narrative synthesis was conducted as a method of synthesis. The Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan 5.4) was used for meta-analysis. ResultsThe systematic review and meta-analysis included seven publications. Six interventions were identified and categorised as: eating ability training for people with dementia, staff training and feeding assistance and support. The meta-analysis found evidence of the effect of eating ability training on feeding difficulty, quantified by the Edinburgh Feeding Evaluation in Dementia scale (EdFED) with a weighted mean difference of -1.36 (95% confidence interval: -1.84 to -0.89, p < 0.001) and on self-feeding time. A spaced retrieval intervention showed a positive effect on EdFED. The systematic review discovered that while feeding assistance had a positive effect on feeding difficulty, staff training had no effect. According to the meta-analysis, these interventions had no effect on improving the nutritional status of people with dementia. ConclusionsNone of the included RCTs met the Cochrane risk-of-bias criteria for randomised trials. This review found that direct training for people with dementia and indirect feeding support from care staff resulted in fewer mealtime difficulties. More RCT studies are needed to determine the efficacy of such interventions.

HYMENOPHYLLACEAE; ABRODICTYUM C.PRESL; MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS; S.L. HYMENOPHYLLACEAE; DIVERGENCE TIMES; INDIAN-OCEAN; FILMY FERN; PHYLOGENY; EVOLUTION; BIOGEOGRAPHY	The fern genus Didymoglossum (Hymenophyllaceae) is not so diverse in Africa with seven species at most. However, its local taxonomy is surprisingly still strongly debated, in particular within the Didymoglossum erosum complex interpreted either as a single polymorphic species or as a group of at least three distinct but morphologically very close taxa (D. erosum, Didymoglossum chamaedrys, and Didymoglossum benlii). Investigating these taxonomic issues and more generally the diversity of the genus in Africa and its origin, we conducted a complete anatomo-morphological analysis coupled with a molecular phylogenetic work based on rbcL. Our results support the recognition of all seven species, including Didymoglossum robinsonii that is likely distinct from the Neotropical Didymoglossum reptans to which the African populations were traditionally attributed. We here propose new characters and a novel key to distinguish the seven African species which also include Didymoglossum ballardianum, Didymoglossum lenormandii, and Didymoglossum liberiense. Once the taxonomy is clarified with respect to the distinct evolutionary lineages evidenced, the biogeographic history of the genus in Africa is discussed based on a divergence time estimation and the reconstruction of the ancestral geographic areas. These analyses reveal a Mesozoic (Cretaceous) vicariance event within Didymoglossum which is the second one hypothesized for the family Hymenophyllaceae.

AimsTo synthesise evidence from qualitative primary studies on patients' negative experiences with different health care settings and to obtain a detailed picture of what patients find problematic while receiving health care. DesignMetasynthesis inspired by Sandelowski and Barroso. MethodsA protocol was published in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL (EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (EBSCOhost), PsycInfo (Ovid) and Scopus, on 20.04.2021. Backward and forward citations of included reports were searched for relevant studies and the search was completed in March 2022. Two researchers independently screened and appraised the included reports. A metasynthesis using reflexive thematic analysis and a metasummary were conducted. ResultsTwenty-four reports were included, and four main themes were extracted from the metasynthesis: (1) problems with access to health care services; (2) failure to acquire information about diagnosis, treatment and the expected patient role; (3) experiencing inappropriate care and bad treatment; (4) problems with trusting health care service providers. ConclusionsNegative patient experiences impact patients' physical and psychological health, leading to suffering and hampering patients from involving themselves in their health care. Relevance to clinical practiceNarratives of negative patient experiences aggregated from the findings provide knowledge about what patients need and expect from health care providers. These narratives can help health care professionals reflect on the way they interact with patients and improve their practice. Health care organisations need to prioritise patient participation. Reporting methodPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Patient or public contributionFindings were presented and discussed in a meeting with a reference group representing patients, health care professionals and the public.

Regardless of the metal oxide, the free energy changes for the two proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps of the H2SO4 oxidation mechanism indicated that the first PCET is the rate-limiting step that requires a greater energy input than the second one. Based on the free energy change in the rate-limiting step, the WO3 anode with SnO2 was expected to produce electrochemically more H2S2O8 in an aqueous H2SO4 solution than SnO2 only without O-2 evolution from H2O. We also experimentally confirmed that the Faraday efficiency of H2S2O8 production using the WO3 anode deposited on a F-doped SnO2 conductive glass (FTO) with lower applied potential is superior to FTO only.

We fitted logistic regression models to assess the predictors of quitting smoking.Results The proportion of current smokers decreased from 29.7% at baseline to 23.6% at follow-up, with a cumulative incidence rate of quitting of 28.3% during follow-up. Nondaily smokers were more likely to quit than daily smokers. Of those who were never smokers at baseline, 4.6% were smokers at follow-up, and 23.2% of former smokers at baseline had relapsed at follow-up.Conclusions Nondaily smokers were more likely to have quit smoking at follow-up among this cohort of nursing students. The early implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control program that includes tobacco-free campus policies, tobacco prevention interventions and cessation support during college years may decrease tobacco use among nursing students.Impact Nursing students' tobacco use is concerning, as they are the future workforce of nurses who have a key role in tobacco product use prevention and cessation. During college years, nursing students have a greater likelihood of experimenting with several smoking status changes as well as to consolidate smoking behaviors. This is the first longitudinal study to highlight the factors associated with quitting smoking among a cohort of Spanish nursing students. Being a nondaily smoker at baseline predicted quitting at follow-up. Our findings support the early implementation of a comprehensive tobacco control program that includes tobacco-free campus policies, tobacco prevention interventions and tobacco cessation support during college years to decrease tobacco product use prevalence among nursing students.Reporting Method We have adhered to STROBE guidelines.

J	Mansourian, S; Vallauri, D				Mansourian, Stephanie; Vallauri, Daniel			Categories of actors involved in tree planting by multinational corporations based in France, Switzerland and the UK	SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						corporate social responsibility; multinational corporations; reforestation; restoration; sustainability; tree planting	RESTORATION	An increasing number of businesses is funding tree planting. Several intermediaries intervene between the funding company and those planting trees, each playing a specific role. To ensure quality tree planting, intervention and leverage points need to be identified. We aim to understand the chain between the corporations that finance tree planting and those planting trees. We reviewed 61 multinational companies from France, Switzerland and the UK, involved in tree planting, and identified the partners with whom they work to attempt to characterise this chain. Our results show that there are at least eight different functions starting with the multinational company, then financiers, regulators, quality controllers, enablers, project developers, brokers and finally, implementers. Most corporations mobilise three to four actors or levels to carry out tree planting. The multiplicity of actors is both positive (e.g., quality assurance) and negative (e.g., adds costs). Growing pressure for corporations to demonstrate social and environmental responsibility signifies that more tree planting is likely. Yet, many challenges exist in this sector, which we aim to describe. Critical challenges we identify include transparency, equity and quality. In conclusion, this booming multilayer sector should be better structured; understanding the actors and their respective roles provides a first step in this direction.

J	Maroosi, A; Muniyandi, RC				Maroosi, Ali; Muniyandi, Ravie Chandren			A novel membrane-inspired multiverse optimizer algorithm for quality of service-aware cloud web service composition with service level agreements	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						cloud computing; membrane-inspired algorithm; multiverse optimization algorithm; service level agreement; web service composition	MOTH-FLAME OPTIMIZATION; P SYSTEMS; QOS; SEARCH	Cloud computing is an emerging technology in computing that provides different services over the Internet. It needs composite services to perform a complex task. Optimal selection of services that provides both functionality and nonfunctionality requirements is an NP-hard problem. This study uses nondeterministic parallel and distributed structures of membrane systems for the recently improved multiverse optimization algorithm to improve the quality of solutions. In the previous membrane-inspired algorithm, the population was divided into subpopulations that evolve different dynamic membranes. This study not only uses a conventional membrane-inspired approach to introduce a conventional membrane-inspired multiverse optimizer (CMIMVO) for the first time but also proposes an algorithm that divides the variables (dimension) into subgroups for different membranes called proposed membrane-inspired multiverse optimizer (PMIMVO). Thus, in PMIMVO, each membrane works on a subgroup to gain global information, which considers the best values obtained by other membranes for other variables. The PMIMVO shows promising results on benchmark function problems. Furthermore, simulation results show that the PMIMVO approach could achieve up to 38% improvement in integrated quality of service (QoS) with attributes including response time, price, availability, and reliability in comparison with the previous approaches, including genetics algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), moth-flame optimization (MFO) improved multiverse optimizer (MVO), and CMIMVO.

The dispersal of microbes among and within flowers by butterflies	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Lepidoptera; microbial transmission; nectar microbes; nectaries; pollinator	FLORAL NECTAR; YEASTS; DIVERSITY; PLANTS	1. Floral microbes, including bacteria and fungi, alter nectar quality, thus changing pollinator visitation. Conversely, pollinator visitation can change the floral microbial community.2. Most studies on dispersal of floral microbes have focused on bees, ants or hummingbirds, yet Lepidoptera are important pollinators.3. We asked (a) where are microbes present on the butterfly body, (b) do butterflies transfer microbes while foraging, and (c) how does butterfly foraging affect microbial abundance on different floret structures.4. The tarsi and proboscis had significantly more microbes than the thorax in wild caught Glaucopsyche lygdamus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) and Speyeria mormonia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). Glaucopsyche lygdamus, a smaller-bodied species, had fewer microbes than S. mormonia.5. As a marker for microbes, we used a bacterium (Rhodococcus fascians, near NCBI Y11196) isolated from a S. mormonia that was foraging for nectar, and examined its dispersal by G. lygdamus and S. mormonia visiting florets of Pyrrocoma crocea (Asteraceae). Microbial dispersal among florets correlated positively with bacterial abundance in the donor floret. Dispersal also depended on butterfly species, age, and bacterial load carried by the butterfly.6. Recipient florets had less bacteria than donor florets. The nectaries had more bacteria than the anthers or the stigmas, while anthers and stigmas did not differ from each other. There was no differential transmission among floral organs.7. Lepidoptera thus act as vectors of floral microbes. Including Lepidoptera is thus crucial to an understanding of plant-pollinator-microbe interactions. Future studies should consider the role of vectored microbes in lepidopteran ecology and fitness.

Deep learning algorithms based on traditional machine learning get better result for predicting RBPs. Recently, deep learning method fused with attention mechanism has attracted huge attention in many fields and gets competitive result. Thus, attention mechanism module may also improve model performance for predicting RNA-protein binding sites. In this study, we propose convolutional residual multi-head self-attention network (CRMSNet) that combines convolutional neural network (CNN), ResNet, and multi-head self-attention blocks to find RBPs for RNA sequence. First, CRMSNet incorporates convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and multi-head self-attention block. Second, CRMSNet can draw binding motif pictures from the convolutional layer parameters. Third, attention mechanism module combines the local and global RNA sequence information for capturing long sequence feature.

Self-reported alcohol use versus phosphatidylethanol in behavioral trials: A study of people living with HIV in Tshwane, South Africa	ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						alcohol consumption; HIV; intervention; phosphatidylethanol; self-report	CONSUMPTION; BIOMARKER; AUDIT; CARE; DRINKING; BLOOD; PETH; ART	Background Accurately quantifying alcohol use among persons with HIV (PWH) is important for validly assessing the efficacy of alcohol reduction interventions.Methods We used data from a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce alcohol use among PWH who were receiving antiretroviral therapy in Tshwane, South Africa. We calculated agreement between self-reported hazardous alcohol use measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; score =8) and AUDIT-Consumption (AUDIT-C; score =3 for females and =4 for males), heavy episodic drinking (HED) in the past 30 days, and heavy drinking in the past 7 days with a gold standard biomarker--phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level (=50 ng/mL)--among 309 participants. We used multiple logistic regression to assess whether underreporting of hazardous drinking (AUDIT-C vs. PEth) differed by sex, study arm, and assessment time point.Results Participants' mean age was 40.6 years, 43% were males, and 48% were in the intervention arm. At 6 months, 51% had PEth =50 ng/mL, 38% and 76% had scores indicative of hazardous drinking on the AUDIT and AUDIT-C, respectively, 11% reported past 30-day HED, and 13% reported past 7-day heavy drinking. At 6 months, there was low agreement between AUDIT-C scores and past 7-day heavy drinking relative to PEth =50 (sensitivities of 83% and 20% and negative predictive values of 62% and 51%, respectively). Underreporting of hazardous drinking at 6 months was associated with sex (OR = 3.504. 95% CI: 1.080 to 11.364), with odds of underreporting being greater for females.Conclusions Steps should be taken to decrease underreporting of alcohol use in clinical trials.

This method included protein precipitation to ensure extraction along with clean-up of the complex biometrics. The Chromatographic separation was done using an Accucore aQ liquid chromatography column (Dim. 100x3, particle size: 2.6 mu m) with the mobile phase of a mixture consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water: 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (03:97, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.300 ml/min. The developed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was further validated utilizing the United States Food and Drug Administration guidelines and all the validation requirements were found to be satisfactory. This proposed method was later successfully utilized to determine the level of the three endocrine-disrupting compounds in the plasma samples obtained from Indian pregnant women. The results suggest that these women might have been exposed to parabens and Bisphenol A from the use of products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, processed food, and the environment.

Migratory birds experience seasonal change in environments and diets throughout the course of the annual cycle that, along with recurrent biological events such as reproduction, may significantly impact their microbiota. In this study, we characterize the intestinal microbiota of four closely related species of migratory Catharus thrushes at three time points of their migratory cycle: during spring migration, on the summer breeding territories and during fall migration. Using observations replicated over 3 years, we determined that microbial community diversity of Catharus thrushes was significantly different across distinct time periods of the annual cycle, whereas community composition was more similar within than across years. Elevated alpha diversity in the summer birds compared to either migratory period indicated that birds may harbour a reduced microbiota during active migration. We also found that community composition of the microbiota did not substantially differ between host species. Finally, we recovered two phyla, Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetota, which are not commonly described from birds, that were in relatively high abundance in specific years. This study contributes to our growing understanding of how microbiota in wild birds vary throughout disparate ecological conditions and reveals potential axes across which an animal's microbial flexibility adapts to variable environments and recurrent biological conditions throughout the annual cycle.

Research has improved understanding of gully erosion processes and increasingly emphasizes sophisticated near-and-remotely sensed methods to characterize and measure gullies. These data can then be analysed using equally sophisticated models and scenarios can be simulated. These advances improve the capacity to predict gully initiation and development over time and space. It is often assumed that better prediction translates into greater impact and uptake of research to solve real world gully erosion problems. Examples of impressive associations between research programmes and major gully management programmes are evident. However, there has been little assessment of the impact of gully research. We argue for a greater focus on achieving impact including interventions that better manage and prevent gully erosion. Opportunities to deliver research impact are assessed using three indicators of progression towards impact; the practical usability of research, whether it is in use by non-researchers, and whether it is useful in guiding improvements in management. Like other natural hazards, gully erosion is a phenomenon of the social, economic and environmental context in which it occurs. Defining the contexts and consequences of gully erosion and using these to frame further research is therefore a means to increase research impact. Enhancing collaboration between research disciplines and with practitioners who act on the research, and a greater focus on the translation of results into practice, is another avenue. Expanding the monitoring and evaluation of gully management can better demonstrate the impact of past research and enable further useful investigations. We urge gully erosion researchers to consider the potential impact of their research, including how it can more effectively inform better and more cost-effective management and political decisions.

Most reports have focused on the mechanisms by which mangroves adapt to high salinity. However, how mangroves cope with seasonal freshwater habitats has seldom been studied. To address this question, we surveyed the river salinity and leaf traits (chlorophyll fluorescence, ion concentrations, carbon isotope ratios and osmolality) of Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco (river mangrove) along a freshwater-dominated river. A. corniculatum at the upstream site was subjected low salinity, being in fresh water for a long period (up to 310 h) in the wet season, which drastically diminished during the dry season. At both sites, the actual photosystem II efficiency (CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EFPSII) and electron transport rates (ETR) of the leaves were higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and the carbon isotope (delta C-13), ions (Na+ and Cl-) concentrations and osmolality showed no seasonal variations. However, the maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m), the proportion for closed PSII reaction centres (1 - qP) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the leaves at the upstream site maintained high levels in the wet season. This quenching analysis indicated that there was a down-regulation of photoprotection at the upstream site during wet season. An explanation for this is that long-term freshwater is a stressful environment for A. corniculatum and maintaining certain level Na+ and Cl- in saline water episode is necessary for A. corniculatum to maintain low water potentials to take up water.

An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo-enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as alpha-glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo-oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non-reducing end with a 4-O-tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3-O-methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl-transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI-MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long-chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.

One of the gold-standard hallmarks of a senescent cell is an increase in lysosomal content, as measured by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (Sen beta-Gal) activity. The lysosome plays a central role in integrating mitogenic and stress cues to control cell metabolism, which is known to be dysregulated in senescence. Despite this, little is known about the cause and consequence of lysosomal biogenesis in senescence. We find here that lysosomes in senescent cells are dysfunctional; they have higher pH, increased evidence of membrane damage and reduced proteolytic capacity. The significant increase in lysosomal content is however sufficient to maintain degradative capacity of the cell to a level comparable to proliferating control cells. We demonstrate that increased nuclear TFEB/TFE3 supports lysosome biogenesis, is a hallmark of multiple forms of senescence and is required for senescent cell survival. TFEB/TFE3 are hypo-phosphorylated and show constitutive nuclear localisation in senescence. Evidence suggests that several pathways may contribute to TFEB/TFE3 dysregulation in senescence.

Adolescent exercise-related lower leg pain musculotendinous characteristics	PM&R			English	Article; Early Access							TIBIAL STRESS SYNDROME; MUSCLE CONTRIBUTIONS; ULTRASOUND MEASURES; RUNNING INJURIES; RUNNERS; HISTORY; KINEMATICS; QUESTIONNAIRE; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION	BackgroundExercise-related lower leg pain (ERLLP) is one of the most common injuries among adolescent runners; however, there is limited information available on lower extremity musculotendinous characteristics in relationship to injury. Ultrasound imaging has previously been used to evaluate musculotendinous structures among adults with chronic lower limb injuries. Similar measurement approaches may be adopted to assess young runners with ERLLP. ObjectiveTo compare ultrasound-derived lower extremity musculotendinous thickness, echogenicity, and muscle fiber pennation angles between adolescent runners with and without ERLLP. DesignCross-sectional design. SettingHospital-affiliated sports injury prevention center. ParticipantsTwenty-eight adolescent runners with (N = 14) and without ERLLP (N = 14). InterventionsRunners' patellar and Achilles tendons, and tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, abductor hallicus, and flexor digitorum brevis muscles were assessed with ultrasound imaging using standardized procedures. Main Outcome MeasuresSeparate repeated measures multivariate analyses of covariance (covariate: gender) were used to compare groups and limbs for mass-normalized musculotendinous thickness, musculotendinous echogenicity, and extrinsic ankle muscle fiber pennation angles. ResultsThe adolescent ERLLP group had reduced average muscle size for all structures except the tibialis anterior compared to the uninjured group (mean difference [MD] range: -0.12-0.49 mm/kg; p range: .002-.05), and reduced average medial gastrocnemius pennation angles on their case limb compared to their contralateral limb and the uninjured group (MD range: -3.7-6.4 degrees; p < .001). The ERLLP group additionally had reduced average patellar and Achilles tendon size (MD range: -0.14--0.15 mm/kg; p range: .02-.03), and lower Achilles tendon echogenicity compared to uninjured counterparts (MD: -18; p = .02). ConclusionsAdolescent runners with ERLLP exhibited morphological musculotendinous changes that may occur either as a result of or as a contributing factor to pain and persistent dysfunction. The findings highlight key targets for rehabilitation for young, injured runners, particularly intrinsic foot muscle strengthening.	[DeJong Lempke, Alexandra F.

Recent progress and structural analyses of domain-selective BET inhibitors	MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Review						BET-Bromodomain; domain-selectivity; epigenetics; reader domain	BROMODOMAIN PROTEIN BRD4; NF-KAPPA-B; HOLE APPROACH; 1ST BROMODOMAIN; SMALL-MOLECULE; P-TEFB; OPTIMIZATION; CHROMATIN; POTENT; BROMO	Epigenetic mechanisms for controlling gene expression through heritable modifications to DNA, RNA, and proteins, are essential processes in maintaining cellular homeostasis. As a result of their central role in human diseases, the proteins responsible for adding, removing, or recognizing epigenetic modifications have emerged as viable drug targets. In the case of lysine-epsilon-N-acetylation (K-ac), bromodomains serve as recognition modules ("readers") of this activating epigenetic mark and competition of the bromodomain-K-ac interaction with small-molecule inhibitors is an attractive strategy to control aberrant bromodomain-mediated gene expression. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family proteins contain eight similar bromodomains. These BET bromodomains are among the more commonly studied bromodomain classes with numerous pan-BET inhibitors showing promising anticancer and anti-inflammatory efficacy. However, these results have yet to translate into Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, in part due to a high degree of on-target toxicities associated with pan-BET inhibition. Improved selectivity within the BET-family has been proposed to alleviate these concerns. In this review, we analyze the reported BET-domain selective inhibitors from a structural perspective. We highlight three essential characteristics of the reported molecules in generating domain selectivity, binding affinity, and mimicking K-ac molecular recognition. In several cases, we provide insight into the design of molecules with improved specificity for individual BET-bromodomains. This review provides a perspective on the current state of the field as this exciting class of inhibitors continue to be evaluated in the clinic.

While the latter are typically assessed in the laboratory, a more efficient and less resource-intensive approach would involve non-destructive and environmentally friendly measurements in situ. Reverse iontophoretic (RI) sampling offers a potential solution to this challenge. ObjectiveWe aimed to demonstrate the non-destructive, RI sampling of phytochemicals of interest from biomass from four different sources. Materials and methodsRI experiments were performed in side-by-side diffusion cells using a current density of 0.5 mA/cm(2), for a predetermined time in a defined pH environment, using (1) fresh leaves from Mangifera indica and Centella asiatica and (2) isolated peel from Punica granatum and Citrus sinensis. ResultsMangiferin, madecassoside, punicalagin, ellagic acid, and hesperidin were extracted from the different biomasses by RI. The amounts extracted ranged from 0.03 mg/100 mg of biomass for the cathodal extraction of madecassoside to 0.63 mg/100 mg of biomass for the anodal extraction of punicalagin. A linear relationship (r(2) = 0.73) between the RI-extracted quantities of punicalagin and those determined using conventional methods was demonstrated. ConclusionThe non-destructive, in situ measurement of phytochemical levels by RI represents a feasible approach for timing the harvesting process.

The implications of pay transparency in the presence of over- and underconfident agents	PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT			English	Article						behavioral operations; over- and underconfidence; pay transparency; social preference	SELF; OVERCONFIDENCE; INEQUALITY; CONTRACTS; BIAS	Many companies are under pressure to improve pay transparency; however, its impact on their agents and principals remains unclear. As a way to investigate the upside and downside of pay transparency, we conduct our study based on a scenario in which agents have "cognitive bias" (namely, over- or underconfident). We also capture the notion of "social comparisons" behavior (namely, behind-averse and ahead-seeking) that occurs under pay transparency. By exploring a one-principal-two-agent model, we find that agents' optimal effort decisions are affected by the "intersection" between agents' social comparison behavior and cognitive bias. Specifically, relative to the opaque policy, we find that pay transparency can entice agents to improve their job performance (in general). Our analysis also provides a guideline for principals to implement transparent payment policies properly (including the optimal payment scheme and the recruitment strategy). Specifically, pay transparency could enable the principal to offer a lower merit-based factor level but a higher base salary level than opaque policy to motivate agents. To obtain high retained earnings, it is profitable for the principal to hire an overconfident agent if the principal chooses to adopt the opaque policy, but hire a mildly underconfident agent if pay transparency is selected. Moreover, we extend the base model to incorporate working capability heterogeneity across agents. We find that the agent's effort incentive and his opponent's working capability move in the same direction when the two agents' working capabilities are comparable under the transparent policy. Finally, by incorporating the environment's relative favoritism into the base model, we observe that when the environment is highly uncertain, the underconfident agent is willing to leverage environment uncertainty but the overconfident agent is willing to exert more effort.

Animal experiment demonstrated that NE exhibited hepatoprotective effect on alcoholic intake-induced ALI via significantly enhancing the hepatic activities of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT), whereas significantly attenuated hepatic levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The potential molecular mechanism and bioactive compounds of NE against ALI were explored by bioinformatics analysis and isosinensetin was found to be themajor bioactive compounds in NE against ALI. The western blot analysis showed that NE inhibited phosphorylation of p65 and I.Ba to suppress the NF-.B pathway. Overall our result indicated thatWBS possesses potential hepatoprotective effects against ALI.

By comparing how each of them commonly imagines 'the human' and 'the weather' in their studies, we particularly highlight how different bodies of work illuminate different facets of the weather-exercise connection. This, we suggest, represents an opportunity for geographers to explore how these facets combine in context with a view to tackling the complex public health challenges associated with increasing human inactivity and a warming world. Building on that, we end with three promising cross-cutting themes that we think could usefully guide these endeavours: adaptation, decision-making and place.

Mindful parenting may be a protective factor for relational adjustment to early adolescence, but its connection with closeness within the mother-adolescent dyad has not been adequately examined in the literature. This study aimed to investigate the effects of how mindful parenting on the day-to-day mother-adolescent relationship dynamics, evaluating the relations between mindful parenting and mother-adolescent closeness and the mediating role of adolescent self-disclosure. A total of 76 Chinese mother-adolescent dyads completed a baseline measure of mindful parenting and 14-day measures of adolescent-report self-disclosure, mother-perceived closeness, and adolescent-perceived closeness. Mindful parenting significantly predicted both mother-perceived and adolescent-perceived closeness, with adolescent self-disclosure serving as a mediator. Adolescent self-disclosure predicted higher mother-adolescent closeness on the same day, but such effects did not carry over to the next day. Our findings provided evidence supporting mindful parenting as a resource for facilitating mother-adolescent closeness in early adolescence. This investigation also encouraged future studies to employ more intensive ambulatory assessments to clarify the daily process of how mindful parenting shapes mother-adolescent relationship dynamics.

However, it is unclear how far this feature of gaze behaviour generalizes in more naturalistic settings. The present study investigates the influence of action affordances on active inference processes revealed by eye movements during interaction with familiar and novel tools. In a between-subject design, a cohort of participants interacted with a virtual reality controller in a low-realism environment; another performed the task with an interaction setup that allowed differentiated hand and finger movements in a high-realism environment. We investigated the differences in odds of fixations and their eccentricity towards the tool parts before action initiation. The results show that participants fixate more on the tool's effector part before action initiation when asked to produce tool-specific movements, especially with unfamiliar tools. These findings suggest that fixations are made in a task-oriented way to plan the distal goals of producing the task- and tool-specific actions well before action initiation. Moreover, with more realistic action affordance, fixations were biased towards the tool handle when it was oriented incongruent with the subjects' handedness. We hypothesize that these fixations are made towards the proximal goal of planning the grasp even though the perceived action on the tools is identical for both experimental setups. Taken together, proximal and distal goal-oriented planning is contextualized to the realism of action/interaction afforded by an environment.

Changing times in public health: The new wave of self-collection of invasive samples	AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material								Testing in public health programs has long been recognised as beneficial but has often been experienced by community members as intrusive and paternalistic. Cervical screening has been seen as even more threatening by women who have experienced sexual violence or come from culturally and linguistically diverse communities. A simple and natural solution to these formidable barriers, increasingly recognised in recent years, has been presented by the advent of self-testing. This article recounts the struggle to encourage medical practitioners to accept patient self-testing. It emphasises the importance of scrutinising our own personal prejudices, listening to the community, and being open to novel strategies that ensure inclusiveness and respect for those whose interests we are seeking to serve.

During storage under conditions reflecting points in a regional German supply chain, typical quality parameters were investigated. Surface bacterial counts of the packaging materials were investigated before and after storage, and material parameters were determined for selected packaging.The results showed that groundwood pulp and sugar cane trays showed higher preserving characteristics of tomatoes in comparison with the references. During storage, weight loss was highest for tomatoes stored in polylactic acid (PLA). The highest increase in microbial count with 3.5 log(10) units was observed after 20 days for tomatoes stored in packaging trays of bamboo. The lowest increase with 0.5 log(10) units and 0.6 log(10) units was recorded for tomatoes stored in packaging trays of groundwood pulp and grass paper, respectively. The results of the packaging parameters show the highest (411.0 N) and lowest (79.0 N) tensile strength for cellulose and groundwood pulp. The water absorption capacity ranged from <10 g/m(2) (bamboo, cellulose) up to 211.2 g/m(2) (corrugated cardboard).

Specifically, this study focused on the idea of identity fusion as a key factor in helping buffer the organization against the negative cognitive and communicative impacts of corporate crises. Surveys conducted among American employees of large corporations revealed that identity fusion indeed mitigated their negative cognitive and communicative reactions to misconduct allegations, and encouraged positive megaphoning behaviours. Furthermore, identity fusion experienced by employees also mediated the relationship between employee-organization relationships and positive and negative megaphoning intentions. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Transient self-association of KRAS is essential for activation of the downstream effector RAF and oncogenicity. The presence of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in the membrane was shown to promote KRAS self-assembly, however, the structural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we employed nanodisc bilayers of defined lipid compositions, and probed the impact of PS concentration on KRAS self-association. Paramagnetic NMR experiments demonstrated the existence of two transient dimer conformations involving alternate electrostatic contacts between R135 and either D153 or E168 on the "alpha 4/5-alpha 4/5" interface, and revealed that lipid composition and salt modulate their dynamic equilibrium. These dimer interfaces were validated by charge-reversal mutants. This plasticity demonstrates how the dynamic KRAS dimerization interface responds to the environment, and likely extends to the assembly of other signaling complexes on the membrane.

While prior research has focused mainly on hospital-specific factors and their impact on patient mortality, surgeon risk factors and patient outcomes, such as readmission risk, have received less attention. We study three drivers of CABG readmission risk-hospital and surgeon case volume, variation in surgeon volume, and surgeon familiarity with hospitals. Drawing on unique patient data sets of CABG surgeries spanning 3 years, we study the relationships between hospital and surgeon case volume, readmission risk, and postoperative length of stay (PLOS). We find evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between case volume and readmission risk and a U-shaped relationship with PLOS. Our results also indicate that surgeon volume variation moderates the relationship between surgeon volume and readmission risk, where readmission risk increases with greater variation in surgeon volume. We observe that the impact of surgeon experience on readmission risk at the focal hospital outweighs their experience at other hospitals.

Herein, the first synthesis of 2D Cs2AgInxBi1-xCl6 (0 <= x <= 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition is demonstrated. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In-Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self-trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs. Moreover, the NPLs exhibit good stability under ambient conditions and against polar solvents, which is ideal for all solution-processing of the materials in low-cost device manufacturing. The first solution-processed light-emitting diodes is demonstrated using the Cs2AgIn0.9Bi0.1Cl6 alloyed double perovskite NPLs as the sole emitting component, showing luminance maximum of 58 cd m(-2) and peak current efficiency of 0.013 cd A(-1). This study sheds light on morphological control and composition-property relationships of double perovskite nanocrystals, paving the way toward ultimate utilizations of lead-free perovskite materials in diverse sets of real-life applications.

Glacial meltwater and sediment resuspension can be important sources of dissolved and total dissolvable aluminum and manganese to coastal ocean surface waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							FLOW-INJECTION ANALYSIS; NORTHERN GULF; TRACE-METALS; SUSPENDED MATTER; REACTIVE IRON; SILICIC-ACID; ALASKA; DISTRIBUTIONS; TRANSPORT; SEAWATER	The supply of aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) to the Gulf of Alaska from coastal sources is poorly constrained. Here, we investigate the seasonality of sources to better constrain Al and Mn cycling in the coastal Gulf of Alaska region and add to our understanding of seasonal and interannual inputs. We examine Mn and Al behavior over the shelf to distinguish between redox-induced release of dissolved trace metals (i.e., diffusion from sediments), sediment resuspension, and meltwater release. Data suggest that, prior to the onset of stratification in the spring, shelf sediment resuspension from deep mixing is an important mechanism for trace metal delivery to surface waters. As spring and summer ensue, increased meltwater discharge coupled with increased surface water temperatures result in stratification of the water column within the coastal Gulf of Alaska, and meltwater becomes a more important source of Al and Mn to the surface waters. The limited data available suggest that a redox-driven flux of Mn from shelf sediments is not as important as the meltwater flux during the summer. In addition, dissolved trace metal concentrations in meltwater-influenced plumes over the shelf exhibit conservative mixing, while particulate trace metal concentrations do not behave conservatively. This indicates that there are different physical controls (particle settling vs. mixing) on the spatial distributions of dissolved and particulate Al and Mn in coastal waters, the manifestation of which are likely highly variable and dependent on the trace metal composition of the river and the hydrodynamics governing this interaction at any given time.

We aimed to systematically review existing data on the association between ARWMH and LUTS and which clinical tools have been used for this assessment. Materials and MethodsWe searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov (from 1980 to November 2021) and considered original studies reporting data on ARWMH and LUTS/LUTD in patients of both sexes aged 50 or above. The primary outcome was OAB. We calculated the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the outcomes of interest using random-effects models. ResultsFourteen studies were included. LUTS assessment was heterogeneous and mainly based on the use of nonvalidated questionnaires. Urodynamics assessment was reported in five studies. ARWMHs were graded using visual scales in eight studies. Patients with moderate-to-severe ARWMHs were more likely to present with OAB and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI; OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.05-2.49, p = 0.03), I-2 = 21.3%) when compared to patients with similar age and absent or mild ARWMH. Discussion and ConclusionsHigh-quality data on the association between ARWMH and OAB is scarce. Patients with moderate to severe ARWMH showed higher levels of OAB symptoms, including UUI, when compared to patients with absent or mild ARWMH. The use of standardized tools to assess both ARWMH and OAB in these patients should be encouraged in future research.

The main strategy adopted to prevent the spread of infection is the rapid identification of COVID-19-positive subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of Lumipulse (R) antigen immunoassay with the real-time RT-PCR, the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a strictly selected asymptomatic population. Materials and MethodsA total of 392 consecutive oro-nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with no symptoms related to COVID-19 at the Emergency Department of AORN Sant'Anna e San Sebastiano, Caserta, Italy to evaluate the analytical performance of Lumipulse (R) SARS-CoV-2 antigen compared to qualitative real-time RT-PCR in asymptomatic patients. ResultsLumipulse (R) SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay shows an overall agreement rate of 97% with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 98%, with a PPV and NPV of 97%. The sensitivity varies according to the cycle threshold (C-t)-value reaching 100% and 86% with 15 < C-t < 25 and C-t >= 25, respectively. The ROC analysis yielded an AUC value of 0.98, suggesting that the antigen test may accurately detect SARS-CoV-2. ConclusionOur data showed that Lumipulse (R) SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay might be an efficient tool in the identification and limitation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in large asymptomatic populations.

Arithmetics of research specialization	BULLETIN OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						job market; research; specialization		In hiring decisions, universities explicitly reward focusing on a specific field. I model the use of research specialization (focusing) in hiring as a signal of ability. Without explicit reward for focusing, candidates who focus are more likely to be able. However, if job market rewards focusing, less able candidates who would otherwise be indifferent between focusing or not, start focusing, which leads to smaller likelihood of observing an able candidate among those who focus than among those who do not. Specialization works as an effective ability signal only when generation of good ideas is highly likely for all ability levels.

J	Sampaio, IGB; Viterbo, J; Guerin, J				Sampaio, Igor Garcia Ballhausen; Viterbo, Jose; Guerin, Joris			Improving robustness of industrial object detection by automatic generation of synthetic images from CAD models	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						CAD models; computer vision; convolutional neural network; deep learning; industrial object detection; synthetic image generation		Object detection (OD) is used for visual quality control in factories. Images that compose training datasets are often collected directly from the production line and labeled with bounding boxes manually. Such data represent well the inference context but might lack diversity, implying a risk of overfitting. To address this issue, we propose a dataset construction method based on an automated pipeline, which receives a CAD model of an object and returns a set of realistic synthetic labeled images (code publicly available). Our approach can be easily used by non-expert users and is relevant for industrial applications, where CAD models are widely available. We performed experiments to compare the use of datasets obtained by the two different ways-collecting and labeling real images or applying the proposed automated pipeline-in the classification of five different industrial parts. To ensure that both approaches can be used without deep learning expertise, all training parameters were kept fixed during these experiments. In our results, both methods were successful for some objects but failed for others. However, we have shown that the combined use of real and synthetic images led to better results. This finding has the potential to make industrial OD models more robust to poor data collection and labeling errors, without increasing the difficulty of the training process.

These products, as well as combustible cigarettes, produce aerosols; the risk of various diseases associated with heated tobacco products may be the same or higher than that with combustible cigarettes. In this study, we examined the effect of Ploom TECH+ extract on gingival epithelial cells. MethodsTobacco leaves from Ploom TECH+ tobacco capsules and water were mixed and heated; the supernatant subsequently collected was the heated tobacco product (HTP; control: HTP not added). Normal human gingival epithelial progenitors were cultured alternately with or without HTP for a total of 1 month. Subsequently, RNA, DNA, and proteins were isolated from these samples and comprehensively analyzed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and western blotting, respectively. ResultsRNA-seq revealed that 284 genes showed a twofold increase and 145 genes showed a twofold decrease in gene expression. A heat map showed genetic differences between the control and HTP groups. A principal component analysis plot showed a clear genetic distribution between the control and HTP. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that genes related to seven GO terms, including cornification and keratinization, were induced by long-term HTP stimulation. By contrast, GO pathways with a significant decrease in component expression were not detected. RRBS revealed that CpG island methylation increased more than twofold in 158 genes and decreased to less than twofold in 171 genes. Methylation of these CpG islands was not correlated with changes in gene expression levels. HTP treatment increased S100A7 expression. ConclusionLong-term HTP stimulation affected epithelial differentiation and keratinization of gingival epithelial cells. Thus, habitual use of Ploom TECH+ may be a risk factor for tobacco-related oral mucosal diseases.

J	Wickman, UL; Schmidt, M				Wickman, Ulrica Loven; Schmidt, Manuela			Experiences of primary care among young adults with mental illness - A systematic literature review	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CARING SCIENCES			English	Review; Early Access						mental health; mental illness; primary care; review; young adults	HEALTH HELP-SEEKING; YOUTH; PERSPECTIVES; DISORDERS; DISTRESS; BARRIERS; PEOPLE; GETS; UK	BackgroundMental illness, such as depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and different addictive diseases, has increased among young adults over the last decade. Mental illness is associated with distress and problems functioning in social activities. Healthcare centres, that is, primary care, serve as the first point of contact with healthcare professionals for those young adults and provide outpatient medical and nursing care covering both physical and mental illness. ObjectiveTo explore experiences of primary care among young adults with mental illness. MethodsA systematic literature review was conducted that followed the method of Bettany-Saltikov and McSherry. A keyword search was performed in various databases, and after a quality assessment 23 articles were included in the review. ResultsYoung adults' experiences from primary care are described in four categories - Facing difficulties to accept help, relational preconditions, structural and organisational hindrances and satisfaction with youth-focused mental health interventions. Young adults with mental illness experience many difficulties in accessing and receiving proper help from primary care. Further, they did not believe in recovery from mental illness, and they also expressed a lack of mental health literacy. ConclusionWhile being the first contact with healthcare professionals, primary care needs to adjust its services to address the growing group of young adults suffering from mental illness. It is necessary to provide tailored guidelines and interventions in primary care for young adults with mental illness, and the Tidal Model may improve the contacts with young adults in primary care.

We aimed to evaluate if LCN2 level was associated with early neurological deterioration (END) in acute ischemic stroke patients, thus hindering clinical recovery. MethodsWe conducted a prospective study of acute ischemic stroke patients between June 2021 and February 2022. Serum LCN2 concentration was measured after admission using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Outcomes included END and 90-day poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 3-6). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale increment >= 4 points within 72 h after admission was defined as END. ResultsA total of 253 acute ischemic stroke patients (mean age, 65.2 +/- 13.4 years; 64.0% male) were recruited. In the multivariate adjustment, increased serum LCN2 levels (per 1-SD increase of LCN2) were associated with a higher risk of END (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.25; p = .002) and 90-day poor outcome (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.22-2.45; p = .002). Restricted cubic splines found a linear relationship between LCN2 level and 90-day unfavorable outcome (END, p = .001 for linearity; 90-day poor outcome, p = .013 for linearity). Subgroup analysis further confirmed the significant association of LCN2 with clinical outcomes. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that higher circulating LCN2 level was associated with an increased risk of early clinical worsening and 90-day unfavorable outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.

Herein, the rational regulation of 3D-printed carbon microlattices (3DP CMs) enabling an ultrathick MnO2 electrode with well-maintained gravimetric capacities is demonstrated. The 3DP CMs made of graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are fabricated by direct ink 3D printing and subsequent high-temperature annealing. 3D printing enables a periodic structure of 3DP CMs, while the thermal annealing contributes to high conductivity and defective surfaces. Due to these structural merits, uniform electrical field distribution and facilitated MnO2 deposition over the 3DP CMs are permitted. The optimal electrode with MnO2 loaded on the 3DP CMs can achieve a record-high specific capacity of 282.8 mAh g(-1) even at a high mass loading of 28.4 mg cm(-2) and high ion transfer dynamics, which reconciles the loading mass and gravimetric performance. As a result, the aqueous ZIBs based on the 3DP CMs loaded MnO2 afford an outstanding performance superior to most of the previous reports. This study reveals the essential role of interaction between active materials and current collectors, providing an alternative strategy for designing high-performance energy storage devices.

LC-MS was applied to analyze the metabolic profiles of serum samples of patients with the long-term intake of CSB (n = 35) and other volunteers with no intake of CSB treated as the control group (n = 35). The raw data of metabolic profiles were analyzed via principal component analysis, partial least squares analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares analysis. MBRole 2.0 online tools were used to analyze the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of different metabolites. The serum metabolic profiles showed several metabolites with large variations, including 2-propyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid, 24-hydroxycholesterol, 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide (d18:1/24:1(15Z)), 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide (d18:1/12:0), 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide (d18:1/14:0), 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholestan-26-al, 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholestane, 7a,25-dihydroxycholesterol, bilirubin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways involved in metabolism included 'choline metabolism in cancer' and 'glycerophospholipid metabolism'. In conclusion, the present study provides a basis with which to explore the molecular-specific mechanisms concerning the effects of the long-term inhalation of CSB on human physical and mental health.

These parameters are also important forcing terms for physically based land surface models (LSMs). However, the quantitative influences of inaccuracies in DSR and Ta products on simulated frozen ground temperatures remain unclear. In this study, three DSR products (CMFD-SR, Tang-SR, and GLDAS-SR) and two Ta products (CMFD-Ta and GLDAS-Ta) were used to force an LSM model in an alpine watershed in Northwest China, to investigate the sensitivity of simulated ground temperatures to different DSR and Ta products. Compared to a control model (CTRL) forced by in situ observed DSR, ground temperatures simulated by the experimental model forced by GLDAS-SR are obviously decreased because GLDAS-SR is much lower than in situ observations. Instead, simulation results in models forced by CMFD-SR and Tang-SR are much closer to those of CTRL. Ta products led to significant errors in simulated ground temperatures. In conclusion, both CMFD-SR and Tang-SR could be used as good alternatives to in situ observed DSR for forcing a model, with acceptable errors in simulation results. However, more care need to be paid for models forced by Ta products instead of Ta observations, and conclusions should be carefully drawn.

However, with the rapid development of high-voltage transformers, higher requirements are placed on the breakdown strength of meta-aramid paper. In this study, meta-aramid chopped fibers/polyphenylene sulfide (MACFs/PPS) composite paper was prepared by a combination of wet-copying and hot-rolling technology. Then the microscopic morphology, mechanical properties, crystallization behavior, insulation properties, and thermal stability of the MACFs/PPS composite paper were studied and evaluated. The experimental results showed that the breakdown strength of the MACFs/PPS composite paper was as high as 46.46 kV/mm, which was 2.7 times higher than the famous Nomex T410 insulating paper. Meanwhile, the MACFs/PPS composite paper presented good mechanical properties and thermal stability. This paper provides a simple and versatile method for the preparation of meta-aramid composite paper with high breakdown strength.

The general character of this printing platform by printing van der Waals materials, organic semiconductors, hybrid perovskites and colloidal nanoparticles with a broad range of properties (from insulators to superconductors) is illustrated. The system is used to easily create several example applications such as an all-printed, paper-supported photodetector. This printing platform can be very helpful for research groups with a wealth of expertise in synthesis of solution-processable nanomaterials but that lack the infrastructure, resources, and expertise to perform traditional inkjet printing for fast device prototyping.

J	Harrod, A; von Benzon, N; Limmer, M				Harrod, Andy; von Benzon, Nadia; Limmer, Mark			'It's probably more about the people': For a person-centred approach to understanding benefits of nature-based interventions	AREA			English	Article; Early Access						health geography; nature-based interventions; person-centred psychotherapy; therapeutic landscapes; UK; wellbeing	THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES; CARE; HEALTH; PLACE; SPACES; RECOVERY; DYNAMICS	Numerous studies demonstrate the benefits of the role of nature, activities, and social interaction at nature-based interventions in improving participants' wellbeing. These health-enabling encounters between people and places have typically been framed in geography via the concept of therapeutic landscapes. Empirical studies and theory have primarily focused on the characteristics of physical and social environments of therapeutic landscapes, while understanding why particular relational encounters are affective in co-creating therapeutic experiences has been given less attention. This paper focuses on understanding the nature of a person, and of interactions between people, as a fundamental part of understanding the way in which nature-based interventions co-create benefits to participants' wellbeing. To consider this we turn to person-centred psychotherapy, where we draw on Carl Rogers' conceptualisations of the person and the therapeutic relationship. Person-centred psychotherapy highlights the importance of a non-judgemental, empathic, and authentic therapeutic relationship in providing an environment for change and that a person is agentic in perceiving and engaging with affective relations in co-creating therapeutic encounters. These encounters have the potential to alleviate and/or transform aspects of a person's sense of self. These shifts in a person's self-concept are part of a process, which enables the flow of benefits from an intervention into participants' daily lives. Our approach is underpinned by using interviews with facilitators and participants of nature-based interventions. We propose that developing geographical understanding of the relational impacts on a person's sense of self and actions has implications beyond health geography.

Glacier decay boosts the formation of new Arctic coastal environments-Perspectives from Svalbard	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						climate change; coastal evolution; fjord circulation; glacier retreat; Holocene; marine-terminating glaciers	TIDEWATER GLACIERS; MASS-LOSS; LANDSCAPE; DYNAMICS; RETREAT	The consequences of accelerating climatic warming on Arctic landscape evolution are far-reaching. In Svalbard, glaciers are rapidly retreating after the Little Ice Age, which leads to exposing new coastal landscapes from marine-terminating glaciers. Precise quantification of these changes was limited until the complete dataset of Svalbard glacier outlines from 1930's was made available. Here, we analyse the new Svalbard glacier change inventory data and demonstrate that glacier retreat led to a major shift from marine-terminating towards land-based glaciers in the last century. This retreat also led to the formation of 922.9 km of new coastline since 1930's creating pristine landscapes governed by paraglacial processes and sediment-rich nearshore fjord environments. Recent palaeogeographical reconstructions suggest that such a mode of coastal evolution was dominant over the extended periods of the Holocene. Transitions from marine-terminating to land-based glaciers have significant implications for fjord circulation, biological production, the state of marine ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles between land and seas and the CO2 budget in coastal waters.

The adaptation of existing methods has the advantage that the results can be compared directly. We adopted an already successfully applied methodology (ILSWE-applied in East Africa), to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of the wind erosion risk between 2005 and 2019 in Southern Africa. The approach integrates climatic variables, a vegetation index, and soil properties to describe the potential impact of wind erosion at the landscape scale. The annual and seasonal variability is determined by the vegetation cover, whereas droughts and strong El Nino events had only regional effects. We estimated that 8.3% of the study area experiences a moderate to elevated wind erosion risk over the 15-year period with annual and inter-annual fluctuations showing a slight upward trend. In general, the desert and drylands in the west have the highest proportion of risk areas, the moist forests in the east are characterized by a very low risk of wind erosion, while the grasslands, shrublands, and croplands in the interior most likely react to changes of climatic conditions. The validation process is based on a comparison with the estimated frequency of dust storms derived from the aerosol optical depth and angstrom exponent and revealed an overall accuracy of 65%. The results of this study identify regions and yearly periods prone to wind erosion to prioritize for further analysis and conservation policies for mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Utilising province-level data from 2015 to 2019, the analysis accounts for regional interaction across Indonesian provinces and estimates spatial spillovers. To address the challenges of applying spatial methods to the world's largest archipelagic nation, two new approaches for the spatial weight matrix criteria are introduced: contiguity-based from artificial boundaries (Thiessen polygons) and trade-based from the Interregional Input-Output Tables. Furthermore, exploiting a new dataset, the study contrasts alternative measurements of inflation and output gap. These distinctions yield new findings. The results indicate the presence of a conventional Phillips curve in Indonesia. Different measures of inflation and the output gap have distinct spatial spillover effects.

Unlike the conventional first-order SMC and some second-order SMC (SOSMC) methods that suffer from chattering, the proposed control method can alleviate chattering and achieve finite-time convergence. Chattering suppression (i.e. eliminating discontinuities) is achieved via continuous control input which is also used to generate the pulse width modulation signals. However, while removing the discontinuities in the control input, the performance of the control method is degraded when it is subjected to disturbances. Therefore, an active disturbance rejection (ADR) based on an ESO is proposed to enhance the performance. In addition, an advanced single-phase phase-locked loop (PLL) using linear observer and quasi-type-1 PLL is also proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experimental results which are compared with the results of the existing SMC methods applied to DVR.

Pediatric intraoperative cardiopulmonary arrests: A survey to evaluate if Medical Emergency Teams are utilized in pediatric operating rooms	PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA			English	Article						anesthesia; cardiac arrest; cardiac resuscitation; general anesthesia; hospital rapid response team; surveys and questionnaires	IMPLEMENTATION; PERFORMANCE	Background Studies have shown that standardized code teams may improve outcomes following cardiac arrests. Pediatric intra-operative cardiac arrests are rare events and are associated with a mortality rate of 18%. There is limited data available regarding use Medical Emergency Team (MET) response to pediatric intra-operative cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to identify the use of MET in response to pediatric intraoperative cardiac arrest as an exploratory step in establishing evidence-based standardized practice across the hospital for training and management of this rare event.Methods An anonymous electronic survey was created and sent to two populations: The Pediatric Anesthesia Leadership Council, a section of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia, and the Pediatric Resuscitation Quality Collaborative, a multinational collaborative group, which works to improve resuscitation care in children. Standard summary and descriptive statistics were used for survey responses.Results The overall response rate was 41%. The majority of respondents worked in a university affiliated, free-standing children's hospital. Ninety-five percent of respondents had a dedicated pediatric MET at their hospital. In 60% of responses from Pediatric Resuscitation Quality Collaborative and 18% of Pediatric Anesthesia Leadership Council hospitals, the MET responds to pediatric intra-operative cardiac arrest; however, the majority of times MET involvement is requested rather than automatic. The MET was found to be activated intraoperatively for situations other than cardiac arrest such as, massive transfusion events, need for extra staff, and for specialty expertise. In 65% of institutions, simulation-based training for cardiac arrest is supported but lacking pediatric intra-operative focus.Conclusions This survey revealed heterogeneity in the composition and response of the medical response teams responding to pediatric intra-operative cardiac arrests. Improved collaboration and cross training among MET, anesthesia, and operating room nursing may improve outcomes of pediatric intra-operative code events.	[Charles, Aidan; Williams, Sacha A.

Bacteria use chemoreceptors to recognize amino acid attractants and to navigate their gradients. In Escherichia coli two likely paralogous chemoreceptors Tsr and Tar detect 9 amino acids, whereas in Pseudomonas aeruginosa the paralogous chemoreceptors PctA, PctB and PctC detect 18 amino acids. Here, we show that the phytobacterium Pectobacterium atrosepticum uses the three non-homologous chemoreceptors PacA, PacB and PacC to detect 19 proteinogenic and several non-proteinogenic amino acids. PacB recognizes 18 proteinogenic amino acids as well as 8 non-proteinogenic amino acids. PacB has a ligand preference for the three branched chain amino acids L-leucine, L-valine and L-isoleucine. PacA detects L-proline next to several quaternary amines. The third chemoreceptor, PacC, is an ortholog of E. coli Tsr and the only one of the 36 P. atrosepticum chemoreceptors that is encoded in the cluster of chemosensory pathway genes. Surprisingly, in contrast to Tsr, which primarily senses serine, PacC recognizes aspartate as the major chemoeffector but not serine. Our results demonstrate that bacteria use various strategies to sense a wide range of amino acids and that it takes more than one chemoreceptor to achieve this goal.

This article reports on the process and initial success of this effort and characterizes the cognitive functioning of the largest multi-site pediatric epilepsy surgery cohort in the United States.Methods: Pediatric neuropsychologists from 18 institutions completed surveys regarding neuropsychological practice and the impact of involvement in the collaborative. Neuropsychological data were entered through an online database. Descriptive analyses examined the survey responses and cognitive functioning of the cohort. Statistical analyses examined which patients were evaluated and if composite scores differed by domain, demographics, measures used, or epilepsy characteristics.Results: Positive impact of participation was evident by attendance, survey responses, and the neuropsychological data entry of 534 presurgical epilepsy patients. This cohort, ages 6 months to 21 years, were majority White and non-Hispanic, and more likely to have private insurance. Mean intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were below to low average, with weaknesses in working memory and processing speed. Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was lowest for patients with younger age at seizure onset, daily seizures, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities.Significance: We established a collaborative network and fundamental infrastructure to address questions outlined by the Epilepsy Research Benchmarks. There is a wide range in the age and IQ of patients considered for pediatric epilepsy surgery, yet it appears that social determinants of health impact access to care. Consistent with other national cohorts, this US cohort has a downward shift in IQ associated with seizure severity.

It is very important to comprehend mechanical properties and constitutive model of the milled mixture of sugarcane for understanding sugarcane crushing process. In this paper, mechanical properties of the milled mixture were investigated by uniaxial compression tests, repeated loading tests and direct shear tests. The elastic-plastic constitutive model was established by using isotropic elastic materials and Modified Cam-Clay model based on phase transition state. Both Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus of the milled mixture were proportional to the loading stress; the compression index and swelling index are 2.23 and 0.10, respectively; and the cohesive force and friction angle are 25.25 kPa and 21.63 degrees, respectively. At last, the proposed constitutive model was verified by uniaxial compression tests. This paper can provide a theoretical basis for the study of mechanism and simulation of sugarcane crushing processes, and is of guidance for the improvement of sugar production process and equipment. Practical applications In this article, the prepared cane and bagasse are collectively called the milled mixture of sugarcane, which includes solid fiber, juice, and air. The interaction of three components of milled mixture can lead to difficulties in extracting juice, an increase in processing energy consumption and other undesirable conditions. In this paper, the mechanical properties and constitutive model of milled mixture of sugarcane are studied. This research can provide a new method for the simulation of sugarcane milling process, and has enlightening significance for the optimization of crushing equipment and technological parameters to improve juice extraction efficiency.

J	Guy, A; Aubin, CE				Guy, Aymeric; Aubin, Carl-Eric			Finite element simulation of growth modulation during brace treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis	JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH			English	Article						adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; bracing; finite element modeling; growth modulation; validation	VERTEBRAL BODY GROWTH; HUMAN TRUNK; SPINE; CAD/CAM; DESIGN; MODEL	Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a spine deformity whose progression during growth is affected by asymmetrical loads acting on the spine. The conservative brace treatment aims to limit the deformity's progression until the end of skeletal growth. This study's objective was to develop a patient-specific finite element model (FEM) simulating immediate in-brace (IB) correction and subsequent growth modulation over 2 years of treatment. Thirty-five retrospective AIS cases with documented correction over 2 years were analyzed. For each case, a patient-specific FEM was built and IB correction was simulated. Vertebral growth and its modulation were modeled using simulated pressures on epiphyseal vertebral growth plates, including a compliance factor representing the recorded brace wear. The simulated Cobb angles, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and apical vertebral rotation were compared with the actual measurements immediately IB and out-of-brace (OOB) at the 2-year follow-up. Treatment outcomes according to simulated compliance scenarios of no brace-wear versus full brace-wear were also computed. The average immediate IB difference between the simulated and actual Cobb angle was 4.9 degrees (main thoracic [MT]) and 3.7 degrees (thoraco-lumbar/lumbar [TL/L]). Two-year OOB, it was 5.6 degrees (MT) and 5.4 degrees (TL/L). The no brace-wear and full brace-wear compliance scenarios resulted respectively in 15/35 (43%) and 31/35 (89%) simulated spine deformities progressing by <5 degrees over 2 years of treatment. Clinical significance: the FEM's ability to simulate the final correction with an accuracy on the order of the radiological measurements' interoperator reproducibility, combined with its sensitivity to brace-wear compliance, provides confidence in the model's predictions for a comparative context of use like improving a brace's design before its application.

It was found that nano-sized Pd could obviously promote CH4 oxidation on CeO2/gamma-Al2O3. The interaction between Pd and CeO2 on gamma-Al2O3 resulted in higher ratios of Ce3+/(Ce3++Ce4+), Pd2+/(Pd2++Pd delta+), and O-ads/(O-ads+O-latt), those benefited the formation of more oxygen vacancies and surface reactive oxygen species for CH4 oxidation. gamma-Al2O3 not only supplied a high surface area and enhanced Pd/CeO2 dispersion on gamma-Al2O3, but also simulated the formation of bicarbonate, where bicarbonate is easier to gasify to CO2 than bidentate carbonate that formed on Pd/CeO2. Operando diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy-mass spectrometer analysis results showed that CH4 oxidation could occur at a temperature as low as 180 degrees C due to the reaction with surface reactive OH, this reaction was also accompanied by the formation of bicarbonate. The mechanism of CH4 oxidation promoted by bicarbonate formation on gamma-Al2O3 was proposed.

Intravenous immunoglobulin treatment for refractory pyoderma gangrenosum	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY			English	Article						chronic disease; intravenous immunoglobulin; neutrophilic dermatoses; pyoderma gangrenosum; treatment-resistant pyoderma gangrenosum	THERAPY	Background: Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been increasingly used for various inflammatory dermatoses with success. Small case series and case reports suggest a role for IVIG in the management of refractory pyoderma gangrenosum (PG).Objective: The objective was to study the characteristics of PG patients treated with IVIG and the efficacy and safety of IVIG for patients with refractory PG.Methods: An analysis was performed of all patients with PG treated with IVIG from 2012 to 2022 at an Australian tertiary hospital seeing a high volume of PG patients.Results: We identified 12 patients, 9 females and 3 males, with median age of 61 years (29-77) at IVIG commencement. All patients were taking systemic corticosteroid therapy prior to IVIG treatment, and all had been treated with a steroid-sparing agent-including ten patients who had been treated with a biologic agent. IVIG was used with corticosteroids in one patient, concurrently with a steroid-sparing agent in nine patients and with a biologic agent in eight patients. Eleven patients demonstrated treatment response to IVIG-six with excellent response and five with good response. Three patients had complete healing of their most active ulcer. One patient did not respond to IVIG. Nine patients were able to wean their prednisolone dose and one patient was able to cease prednisolone. Four adverse events were recorded, and only one patient had to cease treatment due to aseptic meningitis and headaches.Conclusion: Our experience suggests that IVIG may be an efficacious treatment for patients with refractory PG due to its pleiotropic and immunomodulatory effects, particularly for patients with malignancy or other systemic conditions where high-dose immunosuppressive agents are contraindicated.

J	Niezna, M; Davidov, G				Niezna, Maayan; Davidov, Guy			Consent in Contracts of Employment	MODERN LAW REVIEW			English	Article							UNFREE LABOR; HUMAN-RIGHTS; STANDARDS; PRIVACY; LAW; FORM	This article considers the problem of questionable consent in contracts of employment. We suggest that in the context of employment, consent should be understood as a continuum that includes some level of coercion and some level of choice. We show that despite labour law's assumption of inequality of bargaining power, consent is still legally valid in various contexts of employment. We propose some solutions: procedural rules increasing the chance of free and informed consent, and substantive standards restricting recognition of consent due to public policy considerations. The 'menu' we put forward includes some solutions already recognised by law (in some specific contexts) and we also propose some new ones. We then demonstrate how the proposed solutions, both procedural and substantive, can be applied in common contexts where employee consent might be put into question: variation of contractual terms, waiver of access to courts, waiver of legislated rights, waivers related to human rights, and implicit waivers of employee status.

Impact of electrical percolation on mechanical, thermal and flame properties of carbon filler-epoxy composites	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article						electrical conductivity; flame properties; hybrid composites; nanocomposites; polymers	NANOTUBES	Hybrid combination of carbon fillers is utilized in an epoxy matrix to enhance DC/AC conductivity and dielectric constant. Influence at electrical percolation on mechanical strength, thermal stability, co-efficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and flame properties have been investigated since proper balance of the properties is critical. Multiwalled carbon nanotube and graphene nanoplatelets of different weight proportions are incorporated in epoxy matrix to understand their impact of electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. It is observed that weight fraction of the carbon fillers at electrical percolation tends to deteriorate the mechanical and flame properties, minimally influences thermal stability while decreasing the CTE. The weight fractions below the electrical percolation are observed to enhance mechanical and flame properties as compared to percolation level. Though the formation of network of carbon fillers is responsible for enhancement of electrical conduction and CTE, the synergy of carbon fillers is not evident in mechanical and flame properties due to dominating influence of aspect ratio, orientation, and alignment. DC conductivity of 3 x 10(-6) S/m, AC conductivity of 4 x 10(-2) S/m at 8 MHz is observed at electrical percolation. However, composite reveals 5% to 10% reduction in mechanical strength, while the thermal stability and glass transition (126(?)degrees C) are minimally affected at percolation. Co-efficient of thermal expansion improves to 2 x 10(-6)/(?)degrees C and heat deflection temperature increases to 140(?)degrees C. Flame properties reveal divergent trends. The need for proper balance of electrical, thermal and mechanical properties at electrical percolation is emphasized.

The cubic compound crystallizes in space group I (4) over bar 3d with a=12.0106(14) angstrom and Z=4. It contains both non-condensed [PO2N2](5-) and [PO3N](4-) tetrahedra as well as O2- ions, surrounded by Li+ ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6x10(-8) S cm(-1) with an activation energy of 0.46 +/- 0.02 eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4x10(-6) S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li27-x[P4O7+xN9-x]O-3 an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.

Concentration-Dependent Inhibition of Mesophilic PETases on Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Can Be Eliminated by Enzyme Engineering	CHEMSUSCHEM			English	Article						biocatalysis; hydrolases; mesophilic enzymes; PETase; plastics	HYDROLYSIS; MECHANISM; SAKAIENSIS; SOFTWARE; DYNAMICS; FEATURES; SYSTEM; IMPACT; DMSO	Enzyme-based depolymerization is a viable approach for recycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis (IsPETase) is capable of PET hydrolysis under mild conditions but suffers from concentration-dependent inhibition. In this study, this inhibition is found to be dependent on incubation time, the solution conditions, and PET surface area. Furthermore, this inhibition is evident in other mesophilic PET-degrading enzymes to varying degrees, independent of the level of PET depolymerization activity. The inhibition has no clear structural basis, but moderately thermostable IsPETase variants exhibit reduced inhibition, and the property is completely absent in the highly thermostable HotPETase, previously engineered by directed evolution, which simulations suggest results from reduced flexibility around the active site. This work highlights a limitation in applying natural mesophilic hydrolases for PET hydrolysis and reveals an unexpected positive outcome of engineering these enzymes for enhanced thermostability.

J	Bröcker, J; Charlton-Perez, AJ; Weisheimer, A				Broecker, Jochen; Charlton-Perez, Andrew J.; Weisheimer, Antje			A statistical perspective on the signal-to-noise paradox	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						climate model forcing; ensemble forecasts; signal-to-noise ratio	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; SKILL; PREDICTION; FORECASTS; NAO	An anomalous signal-to-noise ratio (also called the signal-to-noise paradox) present in climate models has been widely reported, affecting predictions and projections from seasonal to centennial timescales and encompassing prediction skill from internal processes and external climate forcing. An anomalous signal-to-noise ratio describes a situation where the mean of a forecast ensemble correlates better with the corresponding verification than with its individual ensemble members. This situation has severe implications for climate science, meaning that large ensembles might be required to extract prediction signals. Although a number of possible physical mechanisms for this paradox have been proposed, none has been universally accepted. From a statistical point of view, an anomalous signal-to-noise ratio indicates that forecast ensemble members are not statistically interchangeable with the verification, and an apparent paradox arises only if such an interchangeability is assumed. It will be demonstrated in this study that an anomalous signal-to-noise ratio is a consequence of the relative magnitudes of the variance of the observations, the ensemble mean, and the error of the ensemble mean. By analysing the geometric triangle formed by these three quantities, and given that for typical seasonal forecasting systems both the correlation and the forecast signal are relatively small, it is concluded that an anomalous signal-to-noise ratio should, in fact, be expected in such circumstances.

J	Chávez, EM				Chavez, Elisa M.			Oral health issues of late Baby Boomers (1956-1964)	SPECIAL CARE IN DENTISTRY			English	Article						access to care; disparities; geriatric dentistry	COHORT	ObjectiveTo examine the issues and forces on the oral health of late Baby Boomers born in 1956-1964 that have shaped their oral health status and the opportunities and disparities in oral health care that this generational cohort has experienced. MethodsPast and current literature on the oral health status of this cohort was reviewed in light of concurrent social, political, and economic climates in order to better understand current and future needs in oral health care for this generation. ResultsThe majority of late Baby Boomers have not yet had their 65th birthday. They have benefitted from more opportunities for education, preventive health care, and technological advances in dentistry and medicine than any other prior generation, including their big brothers and sisters-the early Baby Boomers. Yet they have had fewer economic advantages than the early Boomers. Age prevalent diseases, conditions, and medications common to older adults will pose new risks to oral health. Discrete, longitudinal data on oral health status and needs by generational cohort-such as for the late Baby Boomer cohort-is lacking. ConclusionsDespite retaining more of their dentition than any other generation, it also evident that over the course of their lifetime, poverty, racism, and limited education have been unrelenting barriers to oral healthcare and undermine outcomes of care.

However, the development of new nontoxic ammunition (NTA) has prevented conventional metals from being found. In this work, we aim to determine the presence of an inorganic luminescent chemical marker based on rare earth in gunshot residues using the technique of squarewave voltammetry (SWV). After firing, the luminescent complex [(Eu2Zr)(btc)(3)(Hbtc)(0.5).6H(2)O], which is used as a chemical marker, can be detected under a UV lamp. An aqueous solution with 0.1 mol L-1 KCl as supporting electrolyte can be easily collected on carbon paste electrode surfaces for SWV analysis A = 100 mV, f = 10 Hz, and step potential of 5 mV are required. The luminescent marker incorporated into the carbon paste electrode showed two anodic peak currents in the region of 0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and at 0.75 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and also a cathodic one in 0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl). SEM-EDS was able to analyze the same voltammetric results for conventional and nontoxic ammunition containing the luminescent marker. Therefore, voltammetry and SEM-EDS are valid for detecting the new residue marker in GSR. Despite this, the electrochemical method is still more advantageous because of its low cost and lack of expensive equipment and supplies in forensic laboratories.

J	Chrouda, A				Chrouda, Amani			A novel electrochemical sensor based on sodium alginate-decorated single-walled carbon nanotubes for the direct electrocatalysis of heavy metals ions	POLYMERS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						DPASV; heavy metal ions; sensor; single-walled carbon nanotubes; sodium alginate		In recent years, the presence of heavy metal ions in food chains and water poses serious environmental and human health problems. Therefore, there has been a pressing need for fast simple, sensitive, and accurate methods for their detection. In this study a novel electrochemical sensor based on alginate sodium biopolymer decorating single-walled carbon nanotubes was elaborated for the detection of trace level of heavy metal ions. Different brown algae were used to extract sodium alginate, with Cystoseira being the most common. Due to its high extraction yield and high mannuronate/guluronate (M/G) ratio, Compress a brown algae was chosen to disperse with single-walled carbon nanotubes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electron microscopy were monitored to investigate each surface modification. Differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) was used to follow the electrochemical heavy metal ions determination. Moreover, the performance of the optimized heavy metal ions sensor in terms of sensitivity, linear range, limit of detection, and reproducibility was investigated. The detection limits were found to be 0.1, 31, and 1 nM for Pb2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+, respectively. The results reported in this work showed good stability, high sensitivity, and appealing inter-electrode repeatability. Finally, lead detection in tap water was carried out. The metrological performance of the present sensor makes it a good alternative for heavy metal ions detection.

Use of a web-based portal to return normal individual research results in Early Check: Exploring user behaviors and attitudes	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						evaluation study; negative results; newborn screening; patient portals; population genetics		Early Check is a voluntary, large-scale expanded newborn screening study in North Carolina that uses a self-directed web-based portal for return of normal individual research results (IRR). Little is known about participant perspectives in using web-based portals to receive IRR. This study explored user attitudes and behaviors within the Early Check portal using three methods: (1) a feedback survey available to the consenting parent of participating infants (typically mothers), (2) semi-structured interviews conducted with a subset of parents, and (3) Google Analytics. During an approximate 3-year period, 17 936 newborns received normal IRR and there were 27 812 visits to the portal. Most surveyed parents reported viewing their baby's results (86%, 1410/1639). Parents largely found the portal easy to use to get results, and helpful in understanding the results. However, 10% of parents said it was difficult to find enough information to understand their baby's results. In Early Check, providing normal IRR via the portal made a large-scale study practical, and was highly rated by most users. Return of normal IRR may be particularly amenable to web-based portals, as the consequences to participants from not viewing results are modest, and the interpretation of a normal result is relatively straightforward.

We extend the partial posterior p value method (p(3) method) to test multilevel mediation. This contemporary resampling-based composite approach is specifically suited for complex null hypotheses. We develop the p(3) method and investigate its performance within the context of two-level cluster-randomized multilevel mediation studies. Similar to its performance in single-level studies, we found that the p(3) method performed well relative to other mediation tests suggesting it provides a judicious balance between Type I error rate and power. While bias-corrected bootstrapping achieved the best overall performance, the p(3) method serves as an alternative tool for researchers investigating multilevel mediation that is especially useful when conducting a priori power analyses. To encourage utilization, we provide R code for implementing the p(3) method.

Objective measurement of Spanish emotion vocabulary	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Emotion labels; Emotion vocabulary; Measurement; Rasch model	WORDS; MEMORY	Current research on emotion knowledge and competence emphasises the role of language. Emotion vocabulary is one of the indicators of emotion knowledge that can be objectively measured; however, the metric properties of the scores obtained in tests and tasks to measure it have seldom been adequate. In this study we designed and validated a Spanish emotion vocabulary test (MOVE) employing a corpus approach to construct cloze multiple-choice items, administered the test to a Spanish-speaking sample from two countries, Spain and Argentina, and analysed structural validity of the test items with the Rasch model measurement approach. Eighty-eight items showed adequate fit. Overall, a substantial percentage of variance was explained by a latent variable. Reliability indexes at the test, item, and person level were also adequate. As a vocabulary test, the MOVE can be used in psychological and neurological investigation, as well as in language learning research.

Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron-donating groups. With the assistance of an environment-friendly organocatalyst, 10-camphor sulfonic acid (10-CSA), TPI-9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron-donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57 ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73 ppm. Metal binding (2 : 1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072 mol(-1)s(-1)) are calculated from Job's and Stern-Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI-9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an "off-on" fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1 minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0-20 mu g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2 mu g/mL.

Future physicians should therefore have some formal education on these topics. In this narrative review, we focused on how medical education approaches these sometimes polarizing yet fundamental topics. MethodsWe assessed the published literature on sexual and reproductive health education in undergraduate medical education from 2000 to 2021, screening 868 articles and including 52 articles. We included articles that discussed contraception, emergency contraception, pregnancy options counseling, abortion, and ethics related to sexual and reproductive health. ResultsIncluded studies came from 14 countries and described both preclinical and clinical education. Studies assessed medical student knowledge, the effectiveness of educational interventions and medical school faculty perspectives on sexual and reproductive health curricula. Medical educators have employed a variety of approaches to teach sexual and reproductive health including simulation, objective structured clinical examinations, team-based learning, narrative medicine, online modules, and flipped classrooms. ConclusionStudents generally received sexual and reproductive health education favorably, demonstrating increased knowledge and comfort with these topics after an education session. Studies also identified curricular gaps and deficiencies in student knowledge, which may indicate a need for improved and consistent medical school education on contraception and abortion.

Auspicious candidates are so-called molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. In our study, we investigate the surface chemistry of a derivatized norbornadiene/quadricyclane molecule pair. By using suitable push-pull substituents, a bathochromic shift of the absorption onset is achieved, allowing a greater overlap with the solar spectrum. Specifically, the adsorption and thermally induced reactions of 2-carbethoxy-3-phenyl-norbornadiene/quadricyclane are assessed on Pt(111) and Ni(111) as model catalyst surfaces by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Comparison of the respective XP spectra enables the distinction of the energy-rich molecule from its energy-lean counterpart and allows qualitative information on the adsorption motifs to be derived. Monitoring the quantitative cycloreversion between 140 and 230 K spectroscopically demonstrates the release of the stored energy to be successfully triggered on Pt(111). Heating to above 300 K leads to fragmentation of the molecular framework. On Ni(111), no conversion of the energy-rich compound takes place. The individual decomposition pathways of the two isomers begin at 160 and 180 K, respectively. Pronounced desorption of almost the entire surface coverage only occurs for the energy-lean molecule on Ni(111) above 280 K; this suggests weakly bound species. The correlation between adsorption motif and desorption behavior is important for applications of MOST systems in heterogeneously catalyzed processes.

This study analysed the use of non/gendered expressions at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, as state policy is realised in conjunction with personalised service in textual interaction in screen-level bureaucracy. We drew on conversation analysis and membership categorisation analysis to analyse 378 email interactions between clients and social insurance officers, focusing on gendered institutional terminology and gendered person references. The findings suggest that social insurance officers avoided a heteronormative language, in line with Swedish official public language policy, but that a gender-neutral language may come at the cost of formality, standardisation, and de-personalisation. The study brings new knowledge on the ways in which street-level bureaucrats manage responsiveness and standardisation in digital text-based interaction with clients.

A highly enhanced and oscillating thermopower is found for these electron waveguides, with values exceeding 100 mu V K-1 at 0.1 K in the electron-depletion regime. The Mott relation, which governs the band-term thermopower of noninteracting electrons, agrees well with the experimental findings in and around regimes where strongly attractive electron-electron interactions lead to a previously reported Pascal series of conductance explained by bound states of n=2,3,4,... electrons. These results pave the way for quantized thermal transport studies of emergent electron liquid phases in which transport is governed by quasiparticles with charges that are integer multiples or fractions of an electron.

This system includes two polarization filters that separate light from the skin into a surface reflection component image and a diffuse reflection component image. Furthermore, by using a projector as a light source and irradiating the skin using a high-frequency binary illumination pattern, the subsurface scattering component image alone can be separated and generated. Application of an algorithm that calculates the luminance value Y for each component image not only makes it possible to analyze each light signal from the skin quantitatively, but also enables understanding of how each light signal is related to the skin's overall appearance. Using the proposed system, we performed a survey of 154 Japanese women aged from their 20s to their 70s and analyzed age-related changes in the optical properties of their skin. The results revealed the following. First, the luminance value Y of the surface reflection from the cheek and its standard deviation within the analysis area increase with age. Second, the Y value of diffuse reflection from the skin decreases with age. Third, the amount of light in the subsurface scattering components also decreases with age. The proposed system is expected to be suitable for a wide range of applications, including color science, and various studies of the appearance of human skin.

The effects of Si3N4 content on the rheological properties of Si3N4/sol-silica ink and the printing resolution of products were investigated. The microstructure, phase composition, liner shrinkage rate, and fracture behavior of printed samples before and after sintering were systematically characterized in detail. The results showed that the modified inks had the optimized rheological properties, and the stress-shear rate curves corresponding to each slurry could be well described by Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley fluid models. The corresponding slump rates of the printed samples with different Si3N4 to sol-silica mass ratios were all lower than 4%, and the linear shrinkage rate of all of the samples after sintering was below 20%. The fracture behavior under compressive loading of the honeycomb Si3N4 ceramics tended to be non-catastrophic fractures both before and after sintering. The compressive strengths of all of the printed samples decreased with the increase of the Si3N4 content, and the highest compressive strength of the honeycomb ceramics could reach 131.2 MPa after sintering at 1600 degrees C, which was about 366.9% higher than that of the samples in green state prior to the sintering.

Background: Increased lifestyle and self-fulfillment choices have recently become available for college-age students in China. However, there is government, societal, and family pressure for women to be married, ideally by 25 years of age, and to bear children as a patriotic and socially stabilizing duty. Method: A qualitative study using thematic analysis to code data from semistructured interviews with 20 male and female college students. Results: Five attributes of a good mother were identified: "is a guide," "is loving," "communicates with her child as with a friend," "is not overcontrolling," and "balances paid work and time with her child." Conclusion: This study contributes to ongoing research across cultures and societies, which aims to understand what young adults believe to be a "good mother" and how this may affect their future parenting practices. Within the Chinese context, perceptions of a "good mother" include traditional echoes-for example, mother as primary caregivermixed with contemporary ideas-for example, pursuing the right to seek personal fulfillment and financial autonomy and a move away from a top-down authoritarian style of parenting. Gendered perceptions of physical punishment, childrearing anxiety, and parental sacrifice were identified. Implications: Future policymakers should provide greater social and workplace options and implement support services to alleviate the anxiety women experience in their dual aspirations to succeed in paid work and to be good mothers. Educating men regarding their contribution to caregiving and the fostering of family harmony should also be prioritized.	[Nie, Tana Xiaoguang; Zhang, Qianqian; Bowcher, Wendy L.

A machine learning approach	METROECONOMICA			English	Article						deterrence effect; machine learning; prediction; tax evasion	ENFORCEMENT; EVASION	We apply machine learning methods to the prediction of deterrence effects of tax audits. Based on tax declarations data, we predict the increase in future income declarations after being targeted by an audit. We find that flexible models, such as classification trees and ensemble methods based on them, outperform penalized linear models such as Lasso and ridge regression in predicting taxpayers more likely to increase their declarations after an audit. We show that despite the non-randomness of audits, their specific time structure and the distribution of changes in declared amounts suggest a causal interpretation of our results; that is, our approach detects a heterogeneity in the reaction to a tax audit, rather than just forecasting an unconditional future increase. We find that taxpayers identified by our model will on average increase their declared income by euro14,461-the average among all audited taxpayers being euro-205. Our approach allows the tax agency to yield significantly larger revenues by appropriately targeting tax audit.

In contrast to Lin (1996), all forms of licensing facilitate (obstruct) collusion, if the initial cost difference between the firms is relatively less (more). Technology will always be licensed, and the optimal form of licensing is either fixed-fee or royalty or two-part tariff, but collusion may or may not be possible post-licensing. Welfare decreases after licensing if the firms collude only after licensing but not collude under no-licensing.

This work is going to estimate the potential of graphene oxide (GO) as an additive for preparing GO/CEA composites with different GO content from 0 to 0.2 wt%. The influences of GO on the structure and performances of CEA were evaluated by Fourier transform-infrared spectrum, fluorescence microscopy, viscosity, thermogravimetric analysis, tensile test, and dynamic mechanical analysis. Results showed that the functional groups on GO reacted with CEA and improved the compatibility of epoxy resin and asphalt. The viscosity of the GO/CEA composites increased slightly and the pot life decreased significantly, with GO loading increasing. The cured GO/CEA composite with 0.1 wt% GO had the best heat resistance and showed a gentle thermal decomposition. GO improved the toughness of the cured CEA and had a certain weakening effect on its strength. The introduction of GO lowered the glass transition temperature of the cured CEA from 51.4 to 47.1 degrees C and decreased its storage modulus. The preliminary exploration of this study shows that the modification of GO for CEA is feasible, and it is expected to prolong the service life of CEA.

These bright fluorescent nanoparticles have excitation and emission spectra near the red region of the visible light spectrum which is quite useful for bioimaging applications. Using organic molecules like ortho-phenylenediamine (OPDA), L-ascorbic acid and urea, yellow fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were synthesized. We obtained a scalable number of greenish-yellow CDs having an average size of 3 nm. The CDs show significant emission spectra in the yellow fluorescence region (lambda(em)=557 nm). The CDs show remarkable stability in their fluorescence in different pH conditions, ionic stability, photostability as well as thermal stability. These CDs are efficiently uptaken by mammalian cells through the clathrin-mediated pathway. Apart from in vitro studies, we have also used zebrafish larvae as a 3D in vivo model and showed that CDs were uptaken efficiently by larvae showing maximum accumulation and fluorescence in the yolk sac region and the notochord region. The CDs also offer enhancement in cell proliferation, hence showing the application in wound healing. The fluorescence of CDs is quite robust and is not affected by most external stimuli; therefore can be explored as a promising bioimaging tool for targeted bioimaging and biomedical applications.

While the chemical composition and surface morphology of both systems are identical, large differences are found in the optical response. Bulk Cu2O shows pronounced PL peaks at 620, 730, and 920 nm, compatible with the radiative decay of free and bound excitons, whereas broad and asymmetric peaks at 775 and 850 nm are found for Cu2O films grown on Au(111) and Pt(111) supports. The latter represent the PL signature of VO2+ and VO+ defects, being inserted with substrate-dependent concentrations due to the oxygen-poor preparation of the Cu2O films. Despite the strong V-O signature in PL, all Cu2O samples show p-type conductance behavior in STM spectroscopy, indicating an abundance of Cu defects in the lattice. The fact that O vacancies still govern the thin-film PL is explained by a more efficient recombination via V-O- than V-cu-emission channels, as the latter requires exciton formation first. Herein, the high sensitivity of low-temperature PL to probe the defect landscape of dielectrics, being neither reached by photoelectron spectroscopy nor scanning probe techniques is demonstrated.

The highly heterogeneous lithology and pore systems make it difficult to predict the reservoir quality via petrophysical well logs. Core description, computed tomography (CT) scanning, thin sections and wireline well logs are utilized to characterize the lithology, pore spaces are reservoir quality of the Cretaceous Barra Velha Formation pre-salt lacustrine carbonates in the Santos Basin. The results show that the lithology mainly includes shrubstone, grainstone, laminated micrite and massive micrite. The pore systems are dominated by secondary pores, such as intergranular pores, dissolution pores and intercrystalline pores as well as modified primary pores. Geological well logs (conventional well logs, electrical and sonic image logs and nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] logs) are integrated to build the predictable models of the carbonate reservoirs. The shrubstone, which is dominated by intergranular pores, has the highest reservoir quality, which can be derived from NMR logs. Grainstone contains both primary intergranular pores and abundant secondary dissolution pores. The laminated and massive micrite contain only micropores and therefore have the lowest reservoir quality. Lastly, conventional well logs integrated with electrical and sonic image logs are utilized to predict the distribution of lithology and reservoir quality in single wells, and the results are testified by the NMR log data. The shrubstone and grainstone are future exploration targets of the Cretaceous Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin. The results are hoped to give insights into the petrophysical behaviours of various lithologies, and provide theoretical and technical guidance for reservoir evaluation and prediction.

Our goal is to investigate the relationship between postoperative FB and outcomes in pediatric LT recipients. MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study of first-time pediatric LT recipients at a quaternary care children's hospital. Patients were stratified into three groups based on their FB in the first 72 h postoperatively: <10%, 10-20%, and > 20%. Outcomes were pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and hospital length of stay, ventilator-free days (VFD) at 28 days, day 3 severe acute kidney injury, and postoperative complications. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, preoperative admission status, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM)-III score. ResultsWe included 129 patients with median PRISM-III score of 9 (interquartile range, IQR 7-15) and calculated Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease score of 15 (IQR 2-23). A total of 37 patients (28.7%) had 10-20% FB, and 26 (20.2%) had >20% FB. Greater than 20% FB was associated with an increased likelihood of an additional PICU day (adjusted incident rate ratio [aIRR] 1.62, 95% CI: 1.18-2.24), an additional hospital day (aIRR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.10-1.77), and lower likelihood of a VFD at 28 days (aIRR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97). There were no differences between groups in the likelihood of postoperative complications. ConclusionsIn pediatric LT recipients, >20% FB at 72 h postoperatively is associated with increased morbidities, independent of age and severity of illness. Additional studies are needed to explore the impact of fluid management strategies on outcomes.

This study aims to find out the related factors of the "forearm rotation angle" (FR) which relate to the severity of congenital radioulnar synostosis (CRUS), and try to quantify the internal relations of each deformity and help to understand the reconstruction method in surgery treatment of this disease. Methods: This study is case series research. We established 48 digital three-dimensional forearm bone models of 48 patients with congenital radioulnar synostosis classified as Cleary and Omer type 3. All the patients were treated at our institution from January 2010 to June 2016. In total, 10 independent deformities (the rotation angle of forearm; the internal rotation, radial, and dorsal angulation of radius and ulna; the relative length of osseous fusion at PRUJ; the relative dislocation distance of distal radioulnar joint; the relative area of proximal radial epiphysis) involved in the CRUS complex deformity were measured. Pearson correlation analysis for each deformity which was mentioned above was performed, and multivariate linear regression analysis was also performed with FR as the dependent variable and the other deformities as the influential factors. Results: The "dorsal angle of radius" (DAR, 21.69 degrees +/- 21.55 degrees) had the strongest correlation with the FR (79.72 degrees +/- 40.39 degrees), the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.601 (p < 0.01), the internal rotation angle of the radius (IRAR, 82.69 degrees +/- 54.98 degrees) had a moderate correlation with FR, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.552 (p < 0.01). A forearm deformity equation was established: FR = 35.896 + 0.271 DAR + 0.989 IRAR. Conclusion: The dorsal angulation deformity of radius may be the most important deformity that effects the severity of CRUS and should be correct in the first place during reconstruction operation.

However, HIF-1 alpha, the oxygen-regulated subunit, also exerts nontranscriptional functions through interaction with proteins other than ARNT. We have previously shown that the subcellular localization and protein interactions of HIF-1 alpha are controlled by ERK-mediated phosphorylation at Ser641/643. When HIF-1 alpha is modified at these sites, it is nuclear, binds to ARNT, interacts with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and activates transcription of hypoxia-target genes. On the contrary, unmodified HIF-1 alpha is bound by chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), exits the nucleus and, via its association with mortalin, is targeted to the mitochondria to form an antiapoptotic complex. To further characterize the latter function, recombinant fragments of HIF-1 alpha and mortalin were used for in vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitation experiments to map the respective binding sites and show that their interaction is direct and functional. We could also show that embelin, a natural product and known inhibitor of the mortalin-p53 interaction, also disrupts the mortalin-HIF-1 alpha association and, furthermore, removes unmodified HIF-1 alpha from mitochondria. Mitochondrial dissociation of HIF-1 alpha, either by embelin or overexpression of a HIF-1 alpha peptide harbouring the mortalin binding site, under stress conditions leads to mitochondrial localization of the pro-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax) and induction of apoptosis. We suggest that when ERK activity is low under hypoxia, binding of HIF-1 alpha to mortalin inhibits mitochondrial recruitment of Bax and protects cells from apoptotic cell death.

Besides, surface and interface control are necessary but challenging in field-induced electronic switching towards advanced IMT-triggered transistors and optical modulators. Herein, we demonstrated reversible entropy-driven oxygen defect migrations and reversible IMT suppression in vanadium dioxide (VO2) phase-change electronic switching. The initial IMT was suppressed with oxygen defects, which is caused by the entropy change during reversed surface oxygen ionosorption on the VO2 nanostructures. This IMT suppression is reversible and reverts when the adsorbed oxygen extracts electrons from the surface and heals defects again. The reversible IMT suppression observed in the VO2 nanobeam with M2 phase is accompanied by large variations in the IMT temperature. We also achieved irreversible and stable IMT by exploiting an Al2O3 partition layer prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) to disrupt the entropy-driven defect migration. We expected that such reversible modulations would be helpful for understanding the origin of surface-driven IMT in correlated vanadium oxides, and constructing functional phase-change electronic and optical devices.

J	Fond, G; Lucas, G; Boyer, L				Fond, Guillaume; Lucas, Guillaume; Boyer, Laurent			Untreated major depression in healthcare workers: Results from the nationwide AMADEUS survey	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING			English	Article; Early Access						depression; depressive disorders; health services research; mental health; psychiatry; public health	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE; SMOKING-CESSATION; PROFESSIONALS; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; ATTITUDES; SYMPTOMS; ANXIETY; OBESITY; STIGMA	AimsRecent studies have suggested increased rates of depression in healthcare workers (HCWs), with direct impact on care quality and productivity. The objective was to determine the proportion of HCWs adequately treated for their major depression in a nationwide survey, the proportion of lifestyle risk factors for depression, and to determine if working in psychiatry department or professional status may modulate these outcomes. DesignThe method followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement guidelines. A survey comprising the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale was sent to public and private national healthcare facilities. ResultsOverall, 10,325 participants were recruited; 3438 (33.3%) [95% confidence interval 32.4-34.2] met likely diagnostic criteria for clinical depression. Almost 80% of them declared that they had a history of major depressive episode. However, only approximately 23% of them were treated with antidepressants and approximately 13% had a psychiatric follow-up. Depressed HCWs working in psychiatry departments received slightly better care for their depression, but they also consumed more anxiolytics and hypnotics and had more risk factors for depression (including smoking and hazardous drinking). We found specificities according to professions, physicians reported higher rates of hazardous drinking while nurses, nurse assistants, and health executives had higher rates of smoking and twice as much obesity as physicians. ConclusionDisseminating tools to detect major depression, programs destigmatizing depression and antidepressants, promoting physical activity, weight loss, tobacco cessation and reduced alcohol consumption are promising strategies to improve the care of major depression in HCWs. Relevance to clinical practiceReducing depression in healthcare workers is necessary to improve the quality of care, to limit burnout, medical errors, absenteeism and turn-over and globally to improve the wellbeing at work.

However, the plastic deformation and high fractional temperature during the plate connection process significantly impact the mechanical properties and microstructure of the metal sheets. Herein, the AA6061-T6 sheet is connected by the FDS process, and the forming quality and microstructure evolution of the alloy are studied. The results show that the plate and the screw are mechanically connected. Obvious plastic deformation and recrystallization occur in the aluminum alloy around the screw, resulting in a fine-grained zone near the joint interface. The recrystallization phenomenon in the central bushing region promotes the intermolecular fusion between the plates. The high temperature in the connection process partially promotes the dissolution of the strengthening phase, resulting in a decreased strength of the alloy matrix near the screw. The softening zone and hardening zone appear in the plates after the connection, and the hardness values are 55.8% and 105.7% of the alloy matrix.

Despite its widespread usage, it is known to induce a variety of adverse effects, including hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. The goal of this study was to investigate the protective effect of carvacrol, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and some other properties, on lambda-Cyhalothrin-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity 35 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups for this purpose: I-Control group: II-CRV group (50 mg/kg carvacrol), III-LCT group (6.23 mg/kg LCT), IV-LCT + CRV 25 group (6.23 mg/kg LCT + 25 mg/kg carvacrol), and V-LCT + CRV 50 group (6.23 mg/kg LCT + 50 mg/kg carvacrol). Using biochemical, real-time PCR, and western blotting methods, the collected tissues were analyzed. While lambda-Cyhalothrin treatment increased MDA levels, which are indicated of lipid peroxidation, but reduced SOD, CAT, GPx activities, and GSH levels. After receiving carvacrol therapy, the degree of oxidative stress reduced as the values of these parameters approached those of the control group. Increased inflammation, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy with lambda-Cyhalothrin administration reduced with carvacrol co-administration, and liver and kidney tissues were protected from damage, depending on the degree of oxidative stress. After considering all of these data, it was discovered that lambda-Cyhalothrin-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy in the liver and kidneys; however, carvacrol protected the tissues from damage. Our findings indicate that carvacrol may be a promising protective agent in lambda-Cyhalothrin-induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

Because bone marrow (BM), the preferred graft from paediatric sibling donors and for non-malignant diseases, has a red blood cell (RBC) content similar to blood, anti-donor isoagglutinins must either be depleted from the recipient or RBCs removed from the graft. To achieve tolerability of unmanipulated BM grafts, we used controlled infusions of donor ABO-type RBC units to deplete isoagglutinins before the transplant. This retrospective study evaluates the outcomes of 52 ABO major incompatible BM transplants performed at our centre between 2007 and 2019. The use of donor-type RBC transfusions was well tolerated. They effectively reduced isoagglutinins levels, typically achieving target titres after one (60%) or two (29%) transfusions. The approach allowed for successful and uneventful infusions of unmanipulated BM which provided timely engraftment. The transplant outcomes were not inferior to those of a matched-pair control group of patients with ABO-identical donors.

Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx-based biosensors including H2O2-based, O-2-based, pH-sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx-based cancer therapy strategies including lactate-depletion-based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia-activated chemotherapy, H2O2-based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate-specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx-instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx-based nanomedicines are highlighted.

Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with high absorption coefficients at indoor light wavelengths are a promising energy source for the IoT-based sensors. However, OPVs in sensor platforms are not well addressed because of their insufficient and inconsistent power supply under indoor circumstance. Here, a self-powered sensor system that combines highlyefficient indoor OPV modules with a boost converter for real-time temperature measurements is demonstrated. The OPV module with a ternary blend is devised to achieve suitable morphology for low-intensity indoor operation resulting in high efficiency and stability under 1000 lux 3000 K light-emitting diode illumination. Moreover, the voltage of the OPV modules is effectively boosted through an optimized converter to adequately operate the sensor platform. The sensor system integrated with the OPV modules and boost converter successfully measures the real-time changes in temperature in indoor environments. This study proposes an ideal self-powered sensor platform that can be used in smart-home systems using indoor lighting.

To add new dimensions to the discussion. This study aims to consider the impact of patents on environmental technology and environmental degradation in Iceland, along with other indicators, such as economic growth, primary energy consumption (PEC) and trade openness. This effect has not been comprehensively examined in the case of Iceland's economy. To this end, the study adopted novel econometric Fourier-based estimators. The Fourier-augmented Dickey-Fuller (F-ADF) unit root tests, Fourier-autoregressive distributive lag (F-ARDL) cointegration test, F-ARDL for long run estimation, and the Fourier-Toda and Yamamoto (Fourier TY) causality test to determine the impact of explanatory and control indicators on production-based CO2 emissions for the period 1995Q1 to 2019Q4. The findings revealed the impact of environmental technology and trade openness is negative and mitigates production-based CO2 emissions and increases environmental sustainability in Iceland. In contrast, economic growth and PEC were found to have harmful and positive influences on production-based CO2 emissions and increases environmental deterioration in the region. In addition, the Fourier TY causality test suggests unidirectional causality between these indicators in Iceland and the outcome further confirms that environmental technology and trade openness are vital for decreasing production-based CO2 emissions in Iceland. Thus, the study findings benefit policymakers in adopting green innovation activities that increase sustainable energy resources and minimize the detrimental effects of a boost in economic activities in Iceland for sustainable development.

This study was designed to provide new insight into the anterior and posterior hippocampus in schizophrenia from the perspective of functional connectivity.Methods: Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 71 schizophrenia patients and 74 normal controls, we utilized a data-driven approach to functionally segment the hippocampus into anterior and posterior segments and then investigated the functional connectivity patterns within and between the two hippocampal networks at the network, edge, and nodal levels.Results: We found that schizophrenia patients showed hyperconnectivity of both the anterior and posterior hippocampal networks. We also observed that the network alterations appear somewhat greater in the anterior hippocampal network than the posterior network, the left side than the right, and the intranetwork connectivity than the internetwork connectivity.Conclusion: The results reveal convergent and divergent intranetwork and internetwork connectivity patterns of the anterior and posterior hippocampus in schizophrenia, providing novel and important insights into the mechanisms of hippocampal pathology in schizophrenia.

J	Mehrotra, M; Dys, SP; Malti, T				Mehrotra, Mishika; Dys, Sebastian P.; Malti, Tina			Children's sympathy moderates the link between their attentional orientation and ethical guilt	BRITISH JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						attention; emotions; guilt; inhibitory control; moral development; sympathy	MORAL EMOTION ATTRIBUTIONS; INHIBITORY CONTROL; HEART-RATE; CHILDHOOD; TEMPERAMENT; CONSCIENCE	This study examined how children's attentional orientation towards environmental cues, dispositional sympathy and inhibitory control were associated with their ethical guilt. Participants were 4- and 6-year-old children (N = 211; 55% male) from ethnically diverse backgrounds. To assess ethical guilt, children were presented with two vignettes depicting ethical violations and reported how they would feel and why, if they had committed those transgressions. Using eye tracking, we calculated attentional orientation as the percentage of time children attended to other-oriented (i.e., victim) minus self-serving (i.e., object gained by transgressing) cues during these vignettes. Children also reported on their sympathy and completed an observational measure of inhibitory control. Although main effects were not significant, sympathy moderated the link between attentional orientation and ethical guilt: attentional orientation was positively associated with ethical guilt for children with low levels of sympathy but had no effect among those high in sympathy. These findings suggest that practices centred on prompting children to attend to other-oriented cues - and away from self-serving ones - may be effective particularly for children who are generally less sympathetic.

Deceleration capacity of heart rate predicts 1-year mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair	CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						cardiac autonomic dysfunction; deceleration capacity; MitraClip; mortality	PERCUTANEOUS REPAIR; REGURGITATION; OUTCOMES; THERAPY; SYSTEM; ECG	BackgroundRisk stratification for transcatheter procedures in patients with severe mitral regurgitation is challenging. Deceleration capacity (DC) has already proven to be a reliable risk predictor in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. We hypothesized, that DC provides prognostic value in patients undergoing transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral valve repair (TEER). MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed electrocardiogram signals from 106 patients undergoing TEER at the University Hospital of Tubingen. All patients received continuous heart-rate monitoring to assess DC following the procedure. One-year all-cause mortality was defined as the primary end point. ResultsSixteen patients (15.1%) died within 1 year. The DC in nonsurvivors was significantly reduced compared to survivors (5.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 3.0 +/- 1.6 ms, p = 0.002). A higher EuroSCORE II and impaired left ventricular function were furthermore associated with poor outcome. In Cox regression analyses, a DC < 4.5 ms was found a strong predictor of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 0.10, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.79, p = 0.029). Finally, a significant negative correlation was found between DC and residual mitral regurgitation after TEER (r = -0.41, p < 0.001). ConclusionIn patients with severe mitral regurgitation undergoing TEER, DC may serve as a new predictor of follow-up mortality.

The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of metabolic stressors [Non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), beta-hydroxy-butyric acid (BHB), ammonia and urea] exposure during the in vitro ovine oocyte maturation, global DNA methylation, DNA methyltransferase and stress-related gene expression. Colorimetric analysis of global DNA methylation and the expression of the DNA methyltransferase genes (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) were assessed in the matured oocytes, 2-cell embryos and blastocysts produced in vitro from oocytes exposed with the metabolic stressors during 24 h of the in vitro maturation (IVM). Further, the mRNA expression of the stress-related genes (SOD1, SOD2) in the matured oocytes, 2-cell embryos and blastocysts produced was assessed. Significant difference in global DNA methylation levels between all the treatments tested was observed when compared with control in oocytes, two-cell embryos and blastocysts. Elevated concentration of metabolic stressors resulted in increased expressions of several stress-related genes, i.e., SOD1, SOD2 and in mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase genes. The present study is the first to report that the DNA methylation was sensitive to the effects of the metabolic stressors in ovine oocytes/embryos. The aberrant expressions of genes during oocyte development targeted in the present study can provide evidence for the early embryo developmental arrest and blastocysts quality. These results highlighted the sensitivity of the early embryogenesis and more precisely of the reprogramming period to metabolites challenges, in a realistic situation of elevated concentration of metabolic stressors.

Yolk sac development, function and role in rodent pregnancy	BIRTH DEFECTS RESEARCH			English	Review						dysfunction; function; human; rodents; teratogenicity; yolk sac	SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; RAT EMBRYOS; IN-VITRO; ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES; PLACENTAL FUNCTION; TISSUE ANTISERA; WOMEN; HYPERGLYCEMIA; ENDODERM; SERA	During the early phases of embryonic development, the yolk sac serves as an initial placenta in many animal species. While in some, this role subsides around the end of active organogenesis, it continues to have important functions in rodents, alongside the chorio-allantoic placenta. The yolk sac is the initial site of hematopoiesis in many animal species including primates. Cells of epiblastic origin form blood islands that are the forerunners of hematopoietic cells and of the primitive endothelial cells that form the vitelline circulation. The yolk sac is also a major route of embryonic and fetal nutrition apparently as long as it functions. In mammals and especially rodents, macro and micronutrients are absorbed by active pinocytosis into the visceral yolk sac, degraded and the degradation products (i.e., amino acids) are then transferred to the embryo. Interference with the yolk sac function may directly reflect on embryonic growth and development, inducing congenital malformations or in extreme damage, causing embryonic and fetal death. In rodents, many agents were found to damage the yolk sac (i.e., anti-yolk sac antibodies or toxic substances interfering with yolk sac pinocytosis) subsequently affecting the embryo/fetus. Often, the damage to the yolk sac is transient while embryonic damage persists. In humans, decreased yolk sac diameter was associated with diabetic pregnancies and increased diameter was associated with pregnancy loss. In addition, culture of rat yolk sacs in serum obtained from pregnant diabetic women or from women with autoimmune diseases induced severe damage to the visceral yolk sac epithelium and embryonic malformations. It can be concluded that as a result of the crucial role of the yolk sac in the well-being of the early embryo, any damage to its normal function may severely and irreversibly affect further development of the embryo/fetus.

Sun exposure, a relevant exposome factor in acne patients and how photoprotection can improve outcomes	JOURNAL OF COSMETIC DERMATOLOGY			English	Review						acne; photoprotection; post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation; sunscreens; ultraviolet radiation	ORAL ISOTRETINOIN; IN-VITRO; SKIN; EXPRESSION; SUNSCREEN; VULGARIS; RECOMMENDATIONS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PATHOGENESIS; ULTRAVIOLET	BackgroundAcne pathophysiology includes a complex interaction among inflammatory mediators, hyperseborrhea, alteration of keratinization and follicular colonization by Propionibacterium acnes. AimsTo describe the impact of the exposome on acne and how photoprotection can improve outcomes. MethodsA narrative review of the literature was carried out; searches with Google Scholar and Pubmed from January 1992 to November 2022 were performed. The keywords used were "acne," "sunscreens," "photoprotection," "cosmetics," "cosmeceuticals," "pathogenesis," "etiology," "exposome," "sunlight," "stress," "lack of sleep," "diet," "postinflammatory hyperpigmentation," "pollution," "exposome," "ultraviolet radiation," and "visible light." ResultsEnvironmental factors such as solar radiation, air pollution, tobacco consumption, psychological stress, diverse microorganisms, nutrition, among others, can trigger or worsen acne. Solar radiation can temporarily improve lesions. However, it can induce proinflammatory and profibrotic responses, and produce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or post-inflammatory erythema. While photoprotection is widely recommended to acne patients, only four relevant studies were found. Sunscreens can significantly improve symptomatology or enhance treatment and can prevent post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Furthermore, they can provide camouflage and improve quality of life. Based on acne pathogenesis, optimal sunscreens should have emollient, antioxidant and sebum controlling properties. ConclusionsThe exposome and solar radiation can trigger or worsen acne. UV light can induce post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema, and can initiate flares. The use of specifically formulated sunscreens could enhance adherence to topical or systemic therapy, camouflage lesions (tinted sunscreens), decrease inflammation, and reduce the incidence of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation/erythema.

In this sense, ionic liquids based on imidazolium constitute a new category of stabilizer in study. Moreover, the near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been extensively investigated as a tool to follow the properties of polymerization reactions. In this study different ionic liquids are investigated as emulsifiers during the emulsion homopolymerization of the styrene and methyl methacrylate. A quantitative analysis method is developed to determine the properties of latex based on the joint use of the NIR spectra and partial least squares regression (PLS). Kinetic results indicate that the latex properties are greatly influenced by the type of ionic liquid. The current work shows that the NIR spectrophotometer can be successfully used for monitoring of the latex properties, enabling to track the polymerization dynamics even in the presence of ionic liquids.

Nevertheless, we experience our visual percept as a single 3D entity-our visual world that we tend to identify with the physical world. However, experiments point to different geometries in these two worlds. Using the binocular system with asymmetric eyes (AEs), this article studies the global geometric aspects of visual space in the Riemannian geometry framework. The constant-depth curves in the horizontal field of binocular fixations consist of families of arcs of ellipses or hyperbolas depending on the AE parameters and the eyes' fixation point. For a single set of AE parameters, there is a unique symmetric fixation at the abathic distance such that the constant-depth conics are straight frontal lines. Critically, the distribution of these constant-depth lines is independent of such fixations. In these cases, a two-parameter family of the Riemann metrics is proposed to account for the retinotopy of the brain's visual pathways and simulated constant-depth lines. The obtained geodesics for a subset of metric parameters include incomplete geodesics that give finite distances to the horizon. The Gaussian curvature of the phenomenal horizontal field is analyzed for all the metric parameters. The sign of the curvature can be inferred from the global behavior of the constant-depth ellipses and hyperbolas only when for the metric parameters for which the constant-depth frontal lines at the abathic distance fixations are geodesics.

However, the economic relevance of agro-waste valorization is one of the key strategies to ensure sustainable development. Among the agro-waste, oilseed waste and its by-products are usually seen as mass waste after the extraction of oils. Oilseed by-products especially oilseed cakes are a potential source of protein, fiber, minerals, and antioxidants. Oilseed cakes contain high value-added bioactive compounds which have great significance among researchers to develop novel foods having therapeutic applications. Moreover, these oilseed cakes might be employed in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Thus, as a result of having desirable characteristics, oilseed by-products can be more valuable in wide application in the food business along with the preparation of supplements. The current review highlights that plentiful wastes or by-products from oilseeds are wasted if these underutilized materials are not properly valorized or effectively utilized. Hence, promising utilization of oilseeds and their wastes not only assists to overcome environmental concerns and protein insecurity but also helps to achieve the goals of zero waste and sustainability. Furthermore, the article also covers the production and industrial applications of oilseeds and by-products along with the potential role of oilseed cakes and phytochemicals in the treatment of chronic diseases.

Sintered Porous Tellurium Pellet Lithium Battery Electrodes	ENERGY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						carbon free materials; lithium tellurium alloy; lithium tellurium batteries; polymer free electrodes; thick electrodes	ELECTROCHEMICAL PERFORMANCES; LI; DESIGN; CARBON; CHALLENGES; KINETICS; CATHODES; LIFEPO4; CELLS	Thick sintered porous tellurium pellets are fabricated and evaluated as cathodes in lithium-tellurium batteries. These electrodes lack inactive binders and conductive additives and have very high areal capacity, which are important attributes for increasing cell energy density. More commonly tellurium in lithium-tellurium batteries is processed via melt impregnation into a conductive host. In contrast, herein, porous sintered electrodes comprising only tellurium material dramatically increase the areal active material loading to 150 mg cm(-2) compared to the typically reported <5 mg cm(-2). A processing route is used on the tellurium powder to reduce the particle size and increase the electroactive area by a factor of 13. With the increased surface area, gravimetric capacity increased for the same current density and retention of capacity at increasing rates has even greater improvement. Thick all active material-sintered tellurium electrodes provide a route toward high volumetric energy density batteries, where the relatively high electronic conductivity of tellurium is expected to be beneficial due to the lack of conductive additives in the electrode system.

Herein, the authors utilize a facile hydrothermal method to synthesize a novel structure of Co-doped ammonium lanthanum molybdate on Ni foams (Co-ALMO@NF) as self-supported electrocatalysts. Owing to large active surfaces, lattice defect and conductive channel for rapid charge transport, Co-ALMO@NF exhibits good electrocatalytic performances which requires only 349/341 mV to achieve a high current density of 600 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Besides, a low cell voltage of 1.52 V is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium along with an excellent long-term stability for two-electrode configurations. Density functional theory calculations are performed to reveal the reaction mechanism on Co-ALMO@NF, which shows that the Mo site is the most favorable ones for HER, while the introduction of Co is beneficial to reduce the adsorption intensity on the surface of Co-ALMO@NF, thus accelerating OER process. This work highlighted the importance of the structural design for self-supporting electrocatalysts.

Sequential steps, including serum separation, target enrichment, and multiplexed readout by a gel imager, are rapidly accomplished with the flexible and highly integrated device. The microneedle array enabled efficient sampling of trace targets from ng mL(-1) to pg mL(-1) level. Combined with the plasmonic fluor label, the signal is improved by approximate to 7.6 folds compared with the flat substrate-based assay. The device is applied to simultaneously quantify hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, folic acid (FA), and vitamin B-12 (VB12), which are four anemia biomarkers distributed in different environments with different concentration ranges. Featured by the small sample volume (150 mu L), short assay time (20 min), low cost (2 $), robust stability, and user-friendliness, the device is promising for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of anemia in real practice.

Here, by utilizing spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, real-space spin contrasts are successfully resolved to exhibit atomically unidirectional stripes in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films, the plausible closely related compound of bulk FeSe with ordered Fe-vacancies, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As is substantiated by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, the spin contrast originates from a pair-checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state with in-plane magnetization, which is modulated by a spin-lattice coupling. These measurements further identify three types of nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains with distinguishable spin contrasts, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short-ranged patches at elevated temperatures. This work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for FeSe-derived superconductors.

We first construct the output feedback sampled-data controller by the back-stepping method. And the limiting conditions of the sampling period are obtained based on the average dwell time method. We show that the closed-loop system is globally mean-square asymptotically stable and has a weighted L-2-gain. Moreover, our theoretical results are applied to two numerical examples to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

Herein, a new process for the ultra-rapid room-temperature synthesis of perovskite micro/nanocubes with controllable size by combining surface-induced crystallization with the perovskite solution route is described. At first, the perovskite precursors PbBr2 are encapsulated into the nanoporous glass monolith and then react with CsBr solution on a glass surface, where nanoscopic pores facilitate heterogeneous nucleation significantly. The whole synthesis process of micro/nanocubes is ultra-rapid and complete within 20 s. Based on the synthetic perovskite micro/nanocubes, low-threshold upconversion lasing is successfully realized with a high-quality factor of 2845, which further confirms the high quality and excellent optical performance of perovskite micro/nanocubes. This powerful solution route provides an ultra-rapid and facile method for the synthesis of perovskite micro/nanostructure toward miniaturized optoelectronic devices.

MethodsSeventy patients with FS, 140 with major depressive disorder (MDD), and 140 healthy controls were studied. Their DNAs were analyzed for the rs1360780 in the 3 ' region and rs9470080 in the 5 ' region of the FKBP5. Childhood trauma questionnaire and hospital anxiety and depression scale were used. ResultsPatients with FS and those with MDD had less GG and more AA genotypes in both rs9470080 and rs1360780 SNPs compared with those in healthy controls. Similar results were observed for allelic frequencies. There were no significant differences between FS and MDD groups in terms of genotype and allelic frequencies for both SNPs. The results of multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that FKBP5 polymorphisms were not associated with the diagnosis. SignificancePatients with FS and those with MDD had significantly different genotypes in both rs9470080 and rs1360780 SNPs compared with those in healthy controls. However, it seems that FKBP5 polymorphisms were not associated with FS in the absence of depression. Further genetic investigations of patients with FS may increase our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of this condition, but such studies should be large enough and very well designed; they should include a comparison group with depression in addition to a healthy control group.

The underlying molecular underpinnings of this disease are rarely characterized on a genomic scale. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis mainly affects the hippocampus, however, its effect on gene expression in hippocampal neurons is unclear at present. Here, we construct the active and passive immunization mouse models of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to investigate the diverse expression profile of neuronal populations isolated from different hippocampal regions. Dramatic changes in cell proportions and differentially expressed genes were observed in excitatory neurons of the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion. In addition, we found that ATP metabolism and biosynthetic regulators related genes in excitatory neurons of DG subregion were significantly affected. Kcnq1ot1 in inhibitory neurons and Meg3 in interneurons also changed. Notably, the latter two molecules exhibited opposite changes in different models. Therefore, the above genes were used as potential targets for further research on the pathological process of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. These data involve various hippocampal neurons, which delineate a framework for understanding the hippocampal neuronal circuit and the potential molecular mechanisms of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

Duration of Heightened Risk of Acute Ischemic Stroke After Hospitalization for Acute Systolic Heart Failure	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Neurocritical-Care-Society	OCT 26-29, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			acute ischemic stroke; acute systolic heart failure; atrial fibrillation	VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION; ADMINISTRATIVE DATA	BackgroundThe duration and magnitude of increased stroke risk after a hospitalization for acute systolic heart failure (HF) remains uncertain. Methods and ResultsThe authors performed a retrospective cohort study using claims (2008-2018) from a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged >= 66 years. Cox regression models were fitted separately for the groups with and without acute systolic HF to examine its association with the incidence of ischemic stroke after adjustment for demographics, stroke risk factors, and Charlson comorbidities. Corresponding survival probabilities were used to compute the hazard ratio (HR) in each 30-day interval after discharge. The authors stratified patients by the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) before or during the hospitalization for acute systolic HF. Among 2 077 501 eligible beneficiaries, 94 641 were hospitalized with acute systolic HF. After adjusting for demographics, stroke risk factors, and Charlson comorbidities, the risk of ischemic stroke was highest in the first 30 days after discharge from an acute systolic HF hospitalization for patients with AF (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 2.1-2.7]) and without AF (HR, 4.6 [95% CI, 4.0-5.3]). The risk of stroke remained elevated for 60 days in patients with AF (HR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2-1.6]) and was not significantly elevated afterward. The risk of stroke remained significantly elevated through 330 days in patients without AF (HR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7-2.7]) and was no longer significantly elevated afterward. ConclusionsA hospitalization for acute systolic HF is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke up to 330 days in patients without concomitant AF.

First, a class of concrete comparison system for a more accurate and universal nonlinear non-instantaneous impulsive model is constructed. Then, the less conservative sufficient conditions of Lyapunov asymptotic stability are studied by impulsive differential inequalities and generalized comparison principle. On the other hand, an improved non-instantaneous impulsive control scheme with T-S fuzzy model is also presented for the asymptotic stability of the nonlinear systems. Finally, simulation results on controlling a linear and a nonlinear system are presented to illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of the obtained results.

J	Fan, AH; Chen, XM; Yu, L; Li, M				Fan, Aihua; Chen, Xumei; Yu, Lei; Li, Ming			Investigating heterogeneity in travel behaviour change when implementing soft transport interventions: A latent class choice model	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						latent class choice model; soft transport intervention; travel behaviour change; traveller heterogeneity	PRIVATE CAR USE; MOBILITY MANAGEMENT; SATISFACTION; ACCEPTABILITY	Attracting more travellers to shift towards green modes plays a significant role in sustainable transportation development. Soft transport interventions are important strategies for facilitating voluntary travel behaviour change. This study investigates the effects of two soft transport interventions, information intervention and public transport service improvement, on heterogeneous traveller groups' behaviour change. Beijing, China was selected as the case study site. Firstly, three heterogenous traveller groups were identified based on latent class cluster analysis: Group A (20.4%, travel in low-frequency and prefer multimode), Group B (30.3%, travel in middle-frequency and prefer the car) and Group C (49.3%, travel in high frequency and prefer green modes). Then, latent class choice models under two transport interventions were established respectively. The findings indicate that information intervention decreases Group B's preference for car use and exclusion of bicycles. Little effect is observed on travel behaviour change of Group A and C. Public transport service improvement significantly reduces car use of Group B and C.

However, the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers on Li metal is harmful for stable Li cycling; hence, enhancing the physical/chemical properties of SEI layers is important for stabilizing LMAs. Herein, thiourea (TU, CH4N2S) is introduced as a new catalyzing agent for LiNO3 reduction to form robust inorganic-rich SEI layers containing abundant Li3N. Due to the unique molecular structure of TU, the TU molecules adsorb on the Cu electrode by forming Cu-S bond and simultaneously form hydrogen bonding with other hydrogen bonds accepting species such as NO3- and TFSI- through its N-H bonds, leading to their catalyzed reduction and hence the formation of inorganic-rich SEI layer with abundant Li3N, LiF, and Li2S/Li2S2. Particularly, this TU-modified SEI layer shows a lower film resistance and better uniformity compared to the electrochemically and naturally formed SEI layers, enabling planar Li growth without any other material treatments and hence improving the cyclic stability in Li/Cu half-cells and Li@Cu/LiFePO4 full-cells.

Methods and ResultsWe conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study including all patients hospitalized for an incident myocardial infarction in Denmark (1997-2016). Based on their last redeemed opioid prescription before admission, patients were categorized as current users (0-30 days), recent users (31-365 days), former users (>365 days), and nonusers. One-year all-cause mortality was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, any preceding surgery within 6 months before the myocardial infarction admission, and medication use before the myocardial infarction admission. We identified 162 861 patients with an incident myocardial infarction. Of these, 8% were current opioid users, 10% were recent opioid users, 24% were former opioid users, and 58% were nonusers of opioids. One-year mortality was highest among current users (42.5% [95% CI, 41.7%-43.3%]) and lowest among nonusers (20.5% [95% CI, 20.2%-20.7%]). Compared with nonusers, current users had an elevated 1-year all-cause mortality risk (adjusted HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.22-1.30]). Following adjustment, neither recent users nor former users of opioids were at elevated risk. ConclusionsPreadmission opioid use was associated with an increased 1-year all-cause mortality risk following an incident myocardial infarction. Opioid users thus represent a high-risk subgroup of patients with myocardial infarction.

This trend places an increasing burden on already crowded EDs, and experts are concerned these patients do not receive optimal care. The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of ED physicians and nurses who care for patients with cancer. This information can inform strategies to improve oncology care for patients in ED settings.Methods: We used a qualitative descriptive design to summarize to the experiences of ED physicians and nurses (n = 23) caring for patients with cancer. We conducted individual, semistructured interviews to query participants about their perspectives on care for oncology patients in the ED.Results: Physician and nurse participants identified 11 challenges and suggested three potential strategies to improve care. The challenges included the following: risk of infection, poor communication between ED staff and other providers, poor communication between oncology or primary care providers and patients, poor communication between ED providers and patients, difficult disposition decisions, new cancer diagnoses, complex pain management, allocation of limited resources, lack of cancer-specific skills among providers, poor care coordination, and evolving end-of-life decisions. The solutions included the following: patient education, education for ED providers, and improved care coordination.Conclusions: Physicians and nurses experience challenges stemming from three overarching types of factors: illness factors, communication factors, and system-level factors. Solutions for the challenges of providing oncology care in the ED call for new strategies at the levels of the patient, provider, institution, and health care system.

Material and methodsA dentiform was used to fabricate a bilayered lithium disilicate crown on the maxillary right central incisor, following the anatomy and shade of a selected natural tooth. Two crowns (one full-contour, one cutback) were then designed on a prepared maxillary left central incisor, following the contour of the neighboring crown. The designed crowns were used to manufacture monolithic lithium disilicate, bilayered lithium disilicate, bilayered zirconia, and monolithic zirconia crowns, 10 each. An intraoral scanner and a spectrophotometer were used to assess the frequency of matched shades and to calculate the color difference (Delta E) between the two central incisors at the incisal, middle, and cervical thirds. Kruskal-Wallis and two-way ANOVA were used to compare the frequency of matched shades and Delta E values, respectively (alpha = 0.05). ResultsThere was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in frequencies of matched shades for each group at the three sites; except bilayered lithium disilicate crowns. Bilayered lithium disilicate crowns had significantly (p < 0.05) higher match frequency than monolithic zirconia at the middle third. The Delta E value was not significantly (p > 0.05) different among the groups at the cervical third. However, monolithic zirconia had significantly (p < 0.05) higher Delta E values than bilayered lithium disilicate and zirconia at the incisal and middle thirds. ConclusionsBilayered lithium disilicate and zirconia appeared to most closely match the shade of an existing bilayered lithium disilicate crown.

However, the combined impacts of climate change and vegetation degradation on soil erodibility (K) across geographical and temporal scales remain unclear. Here, we present the first systematic investigation of spatio-temporal variations in K under different land uses across the southern Tibetan Plateau over the last 35-40 years, and identify the associated driving factors based on a paired resampling campaign conducted in the 1980s and 2020, covering 148 field sites. K-values derived for the majority of grassland (75.0%) and cropland (66.2%) sites, as well as for a substantial number of forest sites (46.7%) showed a decreasing tendency with time, with average decreases of 31%, 14%, and 5%, respectively. Changes in K were primarily (17.6%) attributed to soil erosion, but were exacerbated by climate change (8.2%). Interestingly, the declines in K resulted in significant decreases in (predicted) soil erosion rates as long as strong disturbances from climate change and human activities were absent. These findings confirm the existence of a negative feedback mechanism between soil erosion and K in most alpine ecosystems on the southern Tibetan Plateau. Our results reveal the extent to which the impact of vegetation degradation on the magnitude of K is enhanced by climate change, thereby providing new insights into the feedback between alpine ecosystems, climate change, and anthropogenic interference.

Identifying co-aggregating proteins within p-Tau inclusions may reveal important insights into processes affected by the aggregation of Tau. We used a proteomic approach, which combines antibody-mediated biotinylation and mass spectrometry (MS) to identify proteins proximal to p-Tau in PSP. Using this proof-of-concept workflow for identifying interacting proteins of interest, we characterized proteins proximal to p-Tau in PSP cases, identifying >84% of previously identified interaction partners of Tau and known modifiers of Tau aggregation, while 19 novel proteins not previously found associated with Tau were identified. Furthermore, our data also identified confidently assigned phosphorylation sites that have been previously reported on p-Tau. Additionally, using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and human RNA-seq datasets, we identified proteins previously associated with neurological disorders and pathways involved in protein degradation, stress responses, cytoskeletal dynamics, metabolism, and neurotransmission. Together, our study demonstrates the utility of biotinylation by antibody recognition (BAR) approach to answer a fundamental question to rapidly identify proteins in proximity to p-Tau from post-mortem tissue. The application of this workflow opens up the opportunity to identify novel protein targets to give us insight into the biological process at the onset and progression of tauopathies.

Artificially sculpting catalytically active sites via laser-etching technique can provide a new prospect in this field and offer a new species of nanocatalyst for achieving superior selectivity and attaining maximum yield via absolute control over defining their location and geometry of every active site at a nanoscale precision. In this work, a controlled protocol of artificial surface engineering is shown by focused laser irradiation on pristine MoS2 flakes, which are confirmed as catalytic sites by electrodeposition of AuNPs. The preferential Au deposited catalytic sites are found to be electrochemically active for nitrogen adsorption and its subsequent reduction due to the S-vacancies rather than Mo-vacancy, as advocated by DFT analysis. The catalytic performance of Au-NR/MoS2 shows a high yield rate of ammonia (11.43 x 10(-8) mol s(-1) cm(-2)) at a potential as low as -0.1 V versus RHE and a notable Faradaic efficiency of 13.79% during the electrochemical nitrogen reduction in 0.1 m HCl.

Findings from this study of eight popular self-help parenting books for 2-to-5-year-olds show that the books rarely, if ever, consider that children have voice/s, or social competence. Where the child does appear, it was to be silenced. Centrally, the authors push failure and responsibility onto parents. We found advice crystallised around either attachment-led approaches, emphasising emotional availability, or behaviourist approaches. The discourses of sleep the books harness are professionalised external lenses. We explore the conflicting and sometimes contradictory ways they position children and families.

Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation can be missed, because of the nonhomogeneous distribution in the heart. The current diagnostic criteria show discrepancies and are partly nonspecific and insensitive. Besides the diagnostic pitfalls, there are controversies in the understanding of the causes, genetic and environmental background, and the natural evolution of the disease. Here, we review the current pathophysiological aspects and gaps that are relevant for future cardiac sarcoidosis diagnostics and research.

Estimated reimbursement impact of COVID-19 on emergency physicians	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article							DEPARTMENT VISITS	Background: The delivery and financing of health care services were altered in unprecedented ways by COVID-19 and subsequent policy responses. We estimated reimbursement losses to emergency physicians in 2020 compared to 2019 related to shifting acute care utilization during COVID-19. Methods: This was an observational analysis of the Clinical Emergency Department Registry (CEDR) and the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). Study sample included all ED visits from a sample of 214 emergency department (ED) sites in the CEDR in 2019 and 2020 as well as all ED visits in the NEDS in 2019. We identified level of service billing code for evaluation and management (E&M) services, insurance payer, and geographic location of ED visits across sites in the CEDR and linked these to fee schedules to estimate total professional reimbursement across sites. Our primary analysis was to estimate reimbursement in 2020 compared to 2019 across the CEDR sites. In our secondary analysis, we linked sites in the CEDR to those in NEDS to estimate nationwide reimbursement. Results: Total E&M reimbursement for emergency physicians in the CEDR was $1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.3 billion in 2020, reflecting a 19.7% decline year over year ($308 million loss). In our secondary analysis, we estimate nationwide losses of $6.6 billion, a -19.4% decline year over year. If emergency physicians had received maximum allowable federal relief funds via CARES Act Phases 1 to 3 (2% of 2019 revenue) this would sum to $680 million (2% of the $34 billion) or 10.3% of the estimated $6.6 billion pandemic-related losses. Conclusions: Our analyses provide an estimate of the scale of economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings warrant consideration for policymaker relief and future redesign of emergency care financing. Ultimately, the COVID-19 pandemic likely expanded known cracks in the financing of health care into steep fault lines.

This review covers recent research concerning the distribution of and damage caused by ALB, as well as major efforts to control and manage ALB in China. The distribution and destruction range of ALB have continued to expand over the past decade worldwide, and the number of interceptions has remained high. Detection and monitoring methods for the early discovery of ALB have diversified, with advances in semiochemical research and using satellite remote sensing in China. Ecological control of ALB in China involves planting mixtures of preferred and resistant tree species, and this practice can prevent outbreaks. In addition, strategies for chemical and biological control of ALB have achieved promising results during the last decade in China, especially the development of insecticides targeting different stages of ALB, and applying Dastarcus helophoroides and Dendrocopos major as biocontrol agents. Finally, we analyze recommendations for ALB prevention and management strategies based on native range and invasive area research. This information will hopefully help some invaded areas where the target is containment of ALB.	[Wang, Lixiang; Li, Chunchun; Wang, Gaijing; Haq, Inzamam U.

ObjectiveThe study aimed to characterize the DRP and interventions provided by clinical pharmacists in the CICU settings. MethodA retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in patients admitted to CICU of a tertiary-care hospital in Thailand during January 2021 to March 2022 was performed. Data were collected from patient's medical records and pharmacy service records. DRPs were categorized according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe classification. Two board-certified pharmacotherapy specialists, pharmacy residents, and trained clinical pharmacists staffed the units 5 days a week. The pharmacist team conducted a medication review and provided interventions to the cardiology team either verbally during the ward round or in writing, as appropriate. Pharmacist interventions were categorized into two groups including retrospective intervention (interventions made to resolve DRPs after an order was made) and prospective interventions (interventions made prior to ordering process). Outcome measures were (1) number of DRPs identified; (2) category of DRPs; (3) number interventions; and (4) acceptance rate of interventions by the medical team. ResultsAmong 576 patients admitted to the CICU, 345 DRPs were identified in 203 patients. The pharmacist team provided a total of 790 interventions including 345 retrospective interventions to resolve DRPs and 445 prospective interventions to guide medication use prior to the ordering process. The most frequent intervention was related to dosage adjustment, drug administration, adding drugs for existing conditions, and suggesting laboratory monitoring. The acceptance rate of the pharmacist intervention was 97.4%, most of which led to changes in drug therapy. ConclusionDRPs in CICU settings are common. Trained clinical pharmacists can effectively resolve DRPs and provide recommendations to improve quality of care through both clinical and distribution functions.

Subclinical liver traits are associated with structural and hemodynamic brain imaging markers	LIVER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Early Access						brain; fibrosis; liver; MRI; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS; GAMMA-GLUTAMYLTRANSFERASE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; BIDIRECTIONAL CHANGES; METABOLIC SYNDROME; DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA	Background & Aims: Impaired liver function affects brain health and therefore understanding potential mechanisms for subclinical liver disease is essential. We assessed the liver-brain associations using liver measures with brain imaging markers, and cognitive measures in the general population. Methods: Within the population-based Rotterdam Study, liver serum and imaging measures (ultrasound and transient elastography), metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and fibrosis phenotypes, and brain structure were determined in 3493 non-demented and stroke-free participants in 2009-2014. This resulted in subgroups of n = 3493 for MAFLD (mean age 69 +/- 9 years, 56% female), n = 2938 for NAFLD (mean age 70 +/- 9 years, 56% female) and n = 2252 for fibrosis (mean age 65 +/- 7 years, 54% female). Imaging markers of small vessel disease and neurodegeneration, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain perfusion (BP) were acquired from brain MRI (1.5-tesla). General cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination and the g-factor. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used for liver-brain associations and adjusted for age, sex, intracranial volume, cardiovascular risk factors and alcohol use. Results: Higher gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were significantly associated with smaller total brain volume (TBV, standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.03 to -0.01); p = 8.4.10(-4)), grey matter volumes, and lower CBF and BP. Liver serum measures were not related to small vessel disease markers, nor to white matter microstructural integrity or general cognition. Participants with ultrasound-based liver steatosis had a higher fractional anisotropy (FA, SMD 0.11, 95% CI (0.04 to 0.17), p = 1.5.10(-3)) and lower CBF and BP. MAFLD and NAFLD phenotypes were associated with alterations in white matter microstructural integrity (NAFLD similar to FA, SMD 0.14, 95% CI (0.07 to 0.22), p = 1.6.10(-4); NAFLD similar to mean diffusivity, SMD -0.12, 95% CI (-0.18 to -0.05), p = 4.7.10(-4)) and also with lower CBF and BP (MAFLD similar to CBF, SMD -0.13, 95% CI (-0.20 to -0.06), p = 3.1.10(-4); MAFLD similar to BP, SMD -0.12, 95% CI (-0.20 to -0.05), p = 1.6.10(-3)). Furthermore, fibrosis phenotypes were related to TBV, grey and white matter volumes. Conclusions: Presence of liver steatosis, fibrosis and elevated serum GGT are associated with structural and hemodynamic brain markers in a population-based cross-sectional setting. Understanding the hepatic role in brain changes can target modifiable factors and prevent brain dysfunction.	[Yilmaz, Pinar; Cremers, Lotte G. M.; Ikram, M.

This can be done by creating physical boundaries to guide the deposition process or using printing technologies; in both approaches, these microscale objects cannot be further modified after they are formed. The utilization of dynamic acoustic fields offers a novel approach to facilitate real-time reconfigurable miniaturized systems in a contactless manner, which can potentially be used in physics, chemistry, biology, as well as materials science. Here, the physical interactions of microscale objects in an acoustic pressure field are discussed and how to fabricate different acoustic trapping devices and how to tune the spatial arrangement of the microscale objects are explained. Moreover, different approaches that can dynamically modulate microscale objects in acoustic fields are presented, and the potential applications of the microarrays in biomedical engineering, chemical/biochemical sensing, and materials science are highlighted alongside a discussion of future research challenges.

In this work, a breakthrough has been made in the fabrication of ultra-thin tantalum (Ta) capacitors with ultra-high capacitance density that can be used for 3D packaging. The key to these excellent performances is the application of Ta foil with nano-porous structure to the anode of the capacitor. The Ta foil with high specific surface area (SSA) is successfully prepared by direct current pulse etching. At a current density of 15 mA cm(-2), a pulse frequency of 50 Hz, and a duty cycle of 30%, the SSA of Ta foil is increased by 76 times after etching in an electrolyte with 0.01 v% TOA for 30 min. Based on this, Ta capacitors with a form factor of less than 40 mu m, showing a capacitance density of 750 nF mm(-2) and a leakage current of less than 2.1 x 10(-7) A at 8 V is successfully fabricated. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the highest capacitance density reported to date for the mentioned form factors.

MethodsTwelve participants (25 +/- 4 yrs, VO(2)max, 47.8 +/- 5.2 mL center dot min(-1)center dot kg(-1) (means +/- SD)) completed the entire experimental procedure. The tests comprised a 5-min constant workload to obtain submaximal parameters followed by an incremental protocol until exhaustion. ResultsThe mean day-to-day variability for the maximal value of VO2 was 2.8%, 1.1% for HR, 18.1% for blood lactate concentration, 2.1% for RER, 1.1% for RPE, and 5.0% for TTE. The values for the corresponding submaximal variables were 3.8% for VO2, 2.1% for HR, 15.6% for blood lactate concentration, 2.6% for RER and 6.0% for RPE. VO(2)max (+4.7% +/- 3.5%), TTE (+17.9% +/- 8.6%), and submaximal HR (-3.2 +/- 3.5%) improved significantly. Except for RPE (p < 0.01), there were no alterations in the coefficient of variation for any parameter. On the group level, the first changes greater than the day-to-day variability in VO(2)max, TTE, and submaximal HR were observed after 21, 12, and 9 training sessions, respectively. ConclusionBased on our findings, we recommend that training studies include assessment of the reliability of the measurements, for example, the CVs in the specific laboratory to be able to judge if the changes detected are actually physiological.

This study aims to create a novel prognostic scale to accurately predict 6-month mortality to more comprehensively facilitate hospice referral. MethodsSociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory variables associated with mortality from the United Network for Organ Sharing database were tested in univariate analysis followed by multivariate analyses with four predictor groups: Demographics, Diagnoses, Complexities, and Laboratory studies to develop the hospice in end-stage liver disease prognostic scale (HELP) scale (70% sample, N = 13 516) followed with replication in a 30% (N = 5792) internal validation sample. ResultsOnly the predictor groups of Complexities and Laboratory studies met the c-statistic threshold of 0.70 for inclusion in the multivariate analyses. Backward elimination in the final logistic regression and validated weighted transformation procedure resulted in: HELP scale = (functional status x 11) + (ascites x 3) + (SBP x 3) + (HE x 4) + (dialysis x 5) + (TIPS x -3) + (albumin x -3) + (MELD-Na >= 21 x 20). HELP scale had a strong predictive value for six-month mortality with Area under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUROC) 0.816 and replicated in the validation sample. ConclusionHELP scale is a novel prognostic score utilizing the strength of model of end-stage liver disease-sodium (MELD-Na), along with clinical factors, for a more nuanced assessment of six-month mortality. This scale can provide an individualized approach in opening discussions of hospice referral and may be better accepted by patients and providers given its contextualization of important clinical factors.

Blends of thermoplastics, however, might have their morphology and properties altered upon processing, therefore, there is uncertainty to some outputs after melt processing. Therefore, having a fixed morphology that is capable of being further processed without significant changes have industrial and academic value. This work presents a comprehensive study of rheological properties and morphology of a selectively crosslinked blend of polyethylene (HDPE) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), where the effect of the following parameters are evaluated: dispersed phase (PVA) weight fraction, continuous phase (HDPE) rheological properties, compatibilizer (PE-g-MAh) and crosslinking agent (maleic anhydride) content. Overall, melt complex viscosity and elasticity have increased with PVA weight fraction and HDPE viscosity. The compatibilizer content has not severely affected melt rheology, although it influenced blend morphology. Crosslinking agent content affected melt rheology and glass transition temperature in a complex way due to the probable competition of some phenomena (crosslinking and reaction vs reduction of crystallinity degree and H bond attenuation), with little effect over PVA morphology.

Practitioner-to-psychiatrist consultation programs have the potential to improve the management of psychiatric conditions in perinatal women. This study describes utilization of a statewide perinatal psychiatric consultation service by OB/GYN practitioners through examination of the volume, responsivity, content and outcomes of clinical inquiries, and satisfaction. MethodsThis quality improvement study describes the 460 telephone or e-mail consultations requested by OB/GYN practitioners over 2 years and housed within a REDCap database. Data include the characteristics of consult users, month-over-month and total utilization, the patient's perinatal status, the reason for contact, current symptoms and medications, and the consulting psychiatrist recommendations. Practitioner satisfaction with consultation is also described. ResultsAfter completion of triage, the psychiatrist returned the practitioner's call <= 5 min in 59% of consultations. The most common inquiries were for pregnant (64%) women for depressive (51%) or anxiety (46%) symptoms with 47% of inquiries reporting the patient was currently taking a psychiatric medication. Had consultation not been available, referral to mental health (41%) or starting a medication (15%) were most often reported. ConclusionsThis perinatal psychiatric consultation service rapidly and effectively met the needs of practitioners practicing in OB/GYN settings across a state having a critical psychiatry shortage and varying urban and rural geography. Future recommendations include the assessment of direct patient outcomes, practitioner skill attainment, and long-term cost savings of this perinatal psychiatric consultation model.

The identification of ED may serve as a potential target for both preventive and treatment interventions, however, the frequency of transdiagnostic ED among children and adolescents has not previously been evaluated. Our aim was to evaluate the frequency and types of ED in accepted and rejected referrals to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Center (CAMHC), Mental Health Services, Copenhagen, Denmark, regardless of psychiatric status and across diagnoses. We aimed to evaluate how often ED would be a leading cause in seeking professional help, and whether children with ED not directly reflecting symptoms of known psychopathology would have higher rejection rates than children with more distinct symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we assessed associations between sex and age with various types of ED.Methods: We examined ED in a retrospective chart review of referrals of children and adolescents aged 3-17 years to the CAMHC between August 1st, 2020, and August 1st, 2021. We ranked problems described in the referral as primary, secondary, and tertiary depending on severity. Further, we examined group differences in the frequency of ED in accepted versus rejected referrals, as well as group differences in types of ED in age and sex distributions, and diagnoses occurring with specific types of ED.Results: ED was present in 62.3% of the 999 referrals and was assessed as the primary issue in twice as many rejected referrals (11.4%) compared to accepted referrals (5.7%). Boys were significantly more often described with externalizing and internalizing behavior (55.5% vs. 31.6%; 35.1% vs. 26.5%) as well as incongruent affect (10.0% vs. 4.7%), whereas girls were more often described with depressed mood (47.5% vs. 38.0%) and self-harm (23.8% vs. 9.4%). The frequency of different types of ED varied with age.Conclusion: The present study is the first to evaluate the frequency of ED in children and adolescents referred to mental health services. The study offers insights into the high frequency of ED and the associations between ED and subsequent diagnoses, which may prove to be a method of early identification of risk of psychopathology. Our findings suggest that ED may rightly be considered a transdiagnostic factor, independent of specific psychiatric disorders, and that an ED-centered as opposed to diagnosis-specific approach to assessment, prevention, and treatment could target transversal symptoms of psychopathology in a more holistic manner.

Practical deployment of NiCo2S4 electrode in SIBs, however, is still hindered by the inferior capacity and unsatisfactory cycling performance, which result from the mismatch between the electrolyte chemistry and electrode. Herein, a functional electrolyte containing 1.0 m NaCF3SO3 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME) (1.0 m NaCF3SO3-DEGDME) is developed, which can be readily used for NiCo2S4 anode with high initial coulomb efficiency (96.2%), enhanced cycling performance, and boosted capacities (341.7 mA h g(-1) after 250 continuous cycles at the current density of 200 mA g(-1)). The electrochemical tests and related phase characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicate the ether-based electrolyte is more suitable for the NiCo2S4 anode in SIBs due to the formation of a stable electrode-electrolyte interface. Additionally, the importance of the voltage window is also demonstrated to further optimize the electrochemical performance of the NiCo2S4 electrode. The formation of sulfide intermediates during charging and discharging is predicted by combining DFT and verified by in situ XRD and HRTEM. The findings indicate that electrolyte engineering would be an effective way of performance enhancement for sulfides in practical SIBs.

Carrier Dynamics of Efficient Triplet Harvesting in AgBiS<sub>2</sub>/Pentacene Singlet Fission Solar Cells	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						AgBiS2 nanocrystal; charge transfer; chromophores; singlet fission; solar cells	EXCITON FISSION; PENTACENE; LIMIT	Singlet fission is a process by which an organic semiconductor is able to generate two triplet excitons from a single photon. If charges from the triplets can be successfully harvested without heavy losses in energy, then this process can enable a single-junction solar cell to surpass the Shockley-Queisser limit. While singlet fission processes are commonly observed in several materials, harvesting the resulting triplets is difficult and has been demonstrated with only a few transport materials. Here, transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate singlet fission and carrier transfer processes at the AgBiS2/pentacene (AgBiS2/Pc) heterojunction. The successful transfer of triplets from pentacene to AgBiS2 and the transfer of holes from AgBiS2 to pentacene is observed. Further singlet fission in pentacene by modifying the crystallinity of the pentacene layer and have fabricated the first singlet fission AgBiS2/Pc solar cell is enhanced. Singlet fission devices exhibit higher external quantum efficiency compared with the control devices, and thus demonstrating the significant contribution of charges from the singlet fission process.

Gas-phase kinetics, POCPs, and an investigation of the contributions of VOCs to urban ozone production in the UK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL KINETICS			English	Article						air pollution; NOx; ozone formation potential; POCP; VOC	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; PRECURSOR RELATIONSHIPS; UNITED-KINGDOM; CREATION POTENTIALS; PARTICULATE MATTER; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; HEALTH; HYDROCARBONS; POLLUTION; LONDON	Ambient concentrations of 22 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at London Marylebone Road (LMR), an urban traffic site, and London Eltham (LE), an urban background site, were analyzed over a period of 23 years (1997-2019) to assess the impact of pollution control strategies. A significant decrease in ambient concentration is seen for the majority of VOCs analyzed with total VOC burden decreasing by 76% and 59% for LMR and LE, respectively, across the period studied. This is likely as a result of legislative controls. This analysis was extended to consider the dominant contribution of VOCs to ozone formation at the sites utilizing photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) values. Similarly, the overall reactivity of the VOC burden at the sites has resulted in a significant decrease of 11% and 7% per year in ozone formation potential (OFP) for LMR and LE, respectively. At LMR, the declines in OFP for VOCs associated with road traffic emissions are all in good agreement at 11%-13% decrease per year. Reasonable agreement is also seen at LE with a decrease of 6%-11% per year in OFP of the VOCs related to traffic sources. VOCs related to non-traffic sources, namely ethane and propane from natural gas leakage, did not see a significant decline over the study period at either site. The variation and composition of the overall VOC burden was compared across three decadal time periods (1997-2000, 2001-2010, 2011-2019) and saw an increase in significance of these pollutants at both sites. At LMR, ethane and propane moved from the fifth and eleventh largest contributors to total VOC burden in 1997-2000 to the first and second largest contributors in 2011-2019. At LE, a similar trend is seen with ethane and propane becoming the first and second largest contributors in the most recent time period, up from second and eighth at the beginning of the dataset. The similarity between these sites suggests such pollutants are not sufficiently controlled under current legislation. The increase in significance of ethane and propane was mirrored in their contribution to ozone generation potential at both sites but ethene continues to dominate in contribution to OFP. At LMR, ethene dominates by a factor of 4 and 5 compared with ethane and propane, respectively, however, at LE, ethene dominates to a lesser extent over ethane and propane at factors of 1 and 3, respectively. Alkanes are typically considered to be less important in the context of OFP due to their low reactivity in comparison to other VOCs. Analysis presented herein demonstrates the negative impact of ignoring such emissions as their influence begins to grow such that alkanes now represent 3 of the 5 highest contributors to tropospheric ozone formation at both sites (in order of contribution at LMR: ethene > propene > n-butane > ethane > propane; and LE: ethene > ethane > n-butane > propane > propene). The importance of high-quality gas-phase kinetic studies to determine the impact of VOCs in ozone production is clear and the usefulness of metrics such as POCPs is demonstrated.

Herein, MoO2/MoS2 heterogeneous nanorods are encapsulated in nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon matrix (MoO2/MoS2@NSC) by controllable sulfidation. MoO2 and MoS2 are coupled intimately at atomic level, forming the MoO2/MoS2 heterointerfaces with different distribution density. Strong electronic interactions are triggered at these MoO2/MoS2 heterointerfaces for enhancing electron transfer. In alkaline media, the optimal material exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances that significantly surpass carbon-covered MoS2 nanorods counterpart (eta(10): 156 mV vs 232 mV) and most of the MoS2-based heterostructures reported recently. First-principles calculation deciphers that MoO2/MoS2 heterointerfaces greatly promote water dissociation and hydrogen atom adsorption via the O-Mo-S electronic bridges during HER process. Moreover, benefited from the high pseudocapacitance contribution, abundant "ion reservoir"-like channels, and low Na+ diffusion barrier appended by high-density MoO2/MoS2 heterointerfaces, the material delivers high specific capacity of 888 mAh g(-1), remarkable rate capability and cycling stability of 390 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1) as the anode of sodium ion battery. This work will undoubtedly light the way of interface density engineering for high-performance electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems.

However, some patients receiving JAK inhibitors develop acne, especially younger patients, or herpes zoster, especially elderly patients, and desire to switch to dupilumab. We experienced two patients with immediate exacerbation of AD after switching from upadacitinib to dupilumab, and herein report these cases. This phenomenon is attributed to the difference in elimination half-life of the two drugs and a slower onset of efficacy of dupilumab than upadacitinib. When switching from a JAK inhibitor to dupilumab, short-term concomitant use, intensifying topical treatment, and/or rescue with cyclosporine should be considered.

Here, a new concept of tunable transverse scattering of light from dielectric nanodimer antennas is suggested theoretically and demonstrated experimentally based on a selective excitation of the specific electromagnetic multipoles with the simultaneous suppression of both forward and backward scatterings. Importantly, it is revealed that the direction of the transverse scattering from nanodimers can be steered actively by varying the vectorial properties of the generalized cylindrical beams, and this new functionality in the experiment is demonstrated.

Population: A cohort of 2546 mother and offspring pairs were enrolled before 16 weeks of gestation and followed up to 24 months postpartum.Methods: Maternal body weights were measured regularly during pregnancy, and their GWG patterns were estimated using the growth mixture model. Robust Poisson models were used to evaluate relative risk (RR) and 95% CI after multivari-able adjustment.Main outcome measures: Offspring atopic allergy and allergic contact dermatitis were defined according to a physician's diagnosis reported by the mother, and food allergy was reported by the mother.Results: Three GWG patterns were identified: 18.1% (461) of the women were de-scribed as pattern 1, characterised by rapid GWG earlier in pregnancy; 56.6% (1442) of the women were described as pattern 2, with steady GWG throughout pregnancy; and 25.3% (643) of the women was described as pattern 3, with rapid GWG later in pregnancy. By the age of 24 months, 360 (14.1%), 109 (4.3%) and 757 (29.7%) offspring had atopic allergy, allergic contact dermatitis or food allergy, respectively. Compared with women in GWG pattern 2, the RRs (95% CIs) among women in pattern 1 were 0.74 (0.55- 0.99) for atopic allergy, 0.64 (0.36- 1.15) for allergic contact dermatitis and 0.95 (0.81- 1.12) for food allergy.Conclusions: Maternal GWG pattern characterised by rapid GWG earlier in pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of atopic allergy in offspring.

J	Mittal, S; Patel, M				Mittal, Sonia; Patel, Mukesh			Age invariant face recognition using discriminative tensor subspace learning with fuzzy based classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						age-invariant; automated face recognition; discriminative; fuzzy fusion; tensor face space		Aging is a complex process that affects both the shape and texture of a face. In the aging domain, various methods have been proposed for age estimation or simulation of the face based on an image at a given age. Face recognition methods that are designed for automatic face recognition are still a challenging issue. We present a novel age invariant face recognition method using tensor subspace learning with fuzzy synthetic classification. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) processed face images are used to learn the tensor sub-space, which converts high dimensional feature space to age-invariants while retaining key elements of the local geometrical structure of the face. Tensor sub-space is better in terms of sub-space learning and feature extraction than Principal Component Analysis (PCA)/Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) that been used in many techniques in the literature. Tensor Normalized Face images are generated which exhibit maximum inter-class distances and minimum intra-class distances. Further local patches are used for synthesizing global Fuzzy membership scores to classify the test face images. Experiments performed on standard face-aging datasets, namely FG-NET, AGEDB, and MORPH-Album-II, and received accuracy of 99.15%, 99.20%, and 99.8%, respectively. Experimental results outperform the current state-of-the-art techniques, and results show the promise of the proposed system for personal identification despite the aging process. It also proved that the local descriptor gives better performance over the global descriptor like PCA for the aging process. The method also demonstrated improved performance as compared with compute-intensive methods that required training on deep networks.

Hydrogen supply chain: Current status and prospects	ENERGY STORAGE			English	Review; Early Access						hydrogen distribution; hydrogen production; hydrogen storage; hydrogen utilization	METHANOL FUEL-CELL; POWER-TO-GAS; STORAGE MATERIALS; FORMIC-ACID; BIOHYDROGEN PRODUCTION; ENERGY CONVERSION; COMPLEX HYDRIDES; CARBON-DIOXIDE; TEMPERATURE; MEMBRANE	In the current world energy scenario with rising prices and climate emergencies, the renewable energy sources are essential for reducing pollution levels triggered by carbon-based fuels. Hydrogen rises in the world energy scenario as an important non-carbon-based energy able to replace fossil fuels. For this reason, the rapid development of hydrogen-related technology has been seen in recent years. This review paper covers hydrogen energy systems from fossil fuel-based hydrogen production, biomass and power from renewable energy sources, to hydrogen storage in compressed gases, liquefied and solid materials, and hydrogen-based power generation technology. It represents a quiet complete set of references that may be effective in increasing the prospects of hydrogen as a fuel in the coming years. The main conclusions drawn are that natural gas and coal supply nearly all of the current hydrogen. The commercially available technologies for hydrogen production are steam methane reforming, partial oxidation, and alkaline electrolysis. The most economical methods for hydrogen production are partial oxidation, steam methane reforming, coal gasification, and biomass gasification. Metallic cylindrical reservoirs are the most promising alternative to underground storage of compressed hydrogen at large scales. Some metal compounds and composites can store a significant amount of hydrogen while maintaining reasonable adsorption and desorption kinetics. The transportation sector is likely to see widespread use of hydrogen in the future, helping to reduce pollution. Vehicles can be powered by fuel cells, which are much more efficient than internal combustion engines. There are still several obstacles in the way of widespread hydrogen utilization. The first one is that the cost of producing hydrogen from low-carbon sources is elevated. As the cost of renewable energy declines and hydrogen production is scaled up, it is anticipated that the hydrogen production costs would decrease over the next years. Innovative technologies are expected to increase the interest on thermochemical hydrogen production to massively substitute electrochemical technologies since they are theoretically cost-effective. More research is needed to fix concerns with some of the thermochemical cycles in order to rise its maturity. Increasing the chemical reaction conversion ratios, which can be resolved utilizing nonequilibrium reactions, is one of them. The transportation sector is likely to see extensive use of hydrogen in the future, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The power required by vehicles may be supplied by fuel cells, which are more efficient than internal combustion engines.

The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increases the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging mu(2)-O-N=C-group of H(2)dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields butane-2,3-dione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that, depending on the solvent, is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as the oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by Cu-II to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)(4)](+). Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent-dependent reaction.

Inflammatory cells in lupus skin lesions can produce leukotrienes (LT), which promote tissue damage. In addition to hypersensitivity reactions, LT are also associated with cardiovascular diseases and elevated serum LT levels have been linked to worse atherosclerotic disease in lupus. Targeting LT could thus be an alternative to treat lupus. We present 4 cases of cutaneous lupus successfully treated with montelukast (MLK), a Cys-LT antagonist. MethodsFour consecutive female systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with refractory skin lesions were treated with MLK (10 mg/d) in the Hospital Universitario Walter Cantidio of the Universidade Federal do Ceara. Skin lesions were scored using Revised Cutaneous LE Disease Area and Severity Index (RCLASI). Relative expression of the 5-lipoxigenase (ALOX5) and 15-lipoxigenase (ALOX15) genes was determined in peripheral blood cells (PBC) from lupus patients and 4 age-matched female controls. ResultsAll patients experienced improvement of skin lesions measured using RCLASI scores within 2-12 weeks following initiation of MLK. The response was sustained for at least 3 months follow-up and no adverse events were recorded. ALOX5 but not ALOX15 gene expression was significantly (P = 0.0425) increased in PBC from SLE patients vs controls. ConclusionThis is the first report of a fast and sustained successful response of cutaneous lupus to MLK. Given its acceptable safety profile, our data encourage development of a randomized trial as an attempt to reposition MLK as a safe, affordable alternative to treat cutaneous lupus.

The one-pot reactions involved transformations of 2-(N'-dicyanomethylene-hydrazino)-benzoic acid (DHB) into three new ligands (Lig-I)(2-), (Lig-II)(2-), and (Lig-III)(2-). The complex [Ni-2(Lig-I)(2)] . 3H(2)O (1) was prepared in a one-pot synthesis in which ligand, (Lig-I)(2-) was formed by the amination of DHB resulting from the nucleophilic attack of an amino group of ethylenediamine (en). The complex [Cu(Lig-II)(en)(H2O)] (2) was prepared in a one-pot synthesis in which ligand, (Lig-II)(2-) was formed by the nucleophilic attack of an amino group of en resulting in an imidazole ring formation. The dinunclear complexes [Zn-2(Lig-III)(2)(CH3OH)(2)] (3) and [Cu-2(Lig-III)(2)(CH3OH)(2)] (4), a linear trinuclear complex [Ni-3(Lig-III)(en)(2)(CH3OH)] (5), and a mononuclear complex [Mn(Lig-III)(CH3OH)(4)] (6) were synthesized using a preparation involving conversion of one of the nitriles on DHB into an imino-ester. The resulting complexes were characterized using a variety of analytical techniques including infra-red and UV-vis spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The complexes displayed a-glucosidase enzyme inhibition with IC50 values in the range of 1.57-207 mu M.

However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of blue PeLEDs still lags. Particularly, defects are inevitable in solution-processed perovskite films, which inhibit the efficient radiative recombination in blue PeLEDs. Herein, a facile ionic liquid (IL, 1,3-dimethyl-3-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate) post-treatment on the as-fabricated quasi-2D perovskite film is reported, to passivate the uncoordinated Pb through the strong interaction with IL. The IL-assisted perovskite film demonstrates a great enhancement of radiative recombination efficiency, and the photoluminescence quantum yield of the film increases from 35.7% to 74.6%. IL post-treatment also adjusts the energy level of perovskite film and enhances the hole injection in PeLED. As a result, the peak EQE of the sky-blue quasi-2D PeLED is improved from 4.0% to 9.0%, while the turn-on voltage is reduced from 3.3 to 3.0 V. This work contributes to a feasible and effective approach for improving the quality of blue quasi-2D perovskites and enhancing the efficiency of blue PeLEDs.

In this work, we investigate the technical feasibility of tensor-valued diffusion encoding at high b-values with q-space trajectory imaging (QTI) analysis, in the human heart in vivo.Methods: Ten healthy volunteers were scanned on a 3T scanner. We designed time-optimal gradient waveforms for tensor-valued diffusion encoding (linear and planar) with second-order motion compensation. Data were analyzed with QTI. Normal values and repeatability were investigated for the mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), microscopic FA (mu FA), isotropic, anisotropic and total mean kurtosis (MKi, MKa, and MKt), and orientation coherence (C-c). A phantom, consisting of two fiber blocks at adjustable angles, was used to evaluate sensitivity of parameters to orientation dispersion and diffusion time.Results: QTI data in the left ventricular myocardium were MD = 1.62 +/- 0.07 mu m(2)/ms, FA = 0.31 +/- 0.03, mu FA = 0.43 +/- 0.07, MKa = 0.20 +/- 0.07, MKi = 0.13 +/- 0.03, MKt = 0.33 +/- 0.09, and C-c = 0.56 +/- 0.22 (mean +/- SD across subjects). Phantom experiments showed that FA depends on orientation dispersion, whereas mu FA was insensitive to this effect.Conclusion: We demonstrated the first tensor-valued diffusion encoding and QTI analysis in the heart in vivo, along with first measurements of myocardial mu FA, MKi, MKa, and C-c. The methodology is technically feasible and provides promising novel biomarkers for myocardial tissue characterization.

In particular, the oxygen stoichiometry on the crystal surface differs from that on the crystal interior in LNMO. The detection of local oxygen loss in LNMO and its correlation with the crystal structure and the cycling stability of LNMO remain challenging. In this study, the effect of oxygen deficiency in LNMO controlled by sintering temperature on the surface crystal structure and electrochemical performance of LNMO is comprehensively investigated. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies segregates at the surface regions of LNMO forming a thin rock-salt and/or deficient spinel surface layer. The atomic-level surface structure reconstruction was demonstrated by annular dark-field and annular bright-field techniques. For the synthesis of LNMO, the higher sintering temperature results in higher crystallinity but the higher oxygen deficiency in LNMO. The high crystallinity of LNMO would increase the thermal stability of LNMO cathodes while the high content of oxygen deficiency would decrease the surface structural stability of LNMO. Therefore, the LNMO sintered at a medium temperature of 850 degrees C achieved the best capacity retention. The results suggest a competitive function mechanism between oxygen stoichiometry and the crystallinity of LNMO on the cycling performance of LNMO.

There have been no case reports of RLN reconstruction using artificial nerve conduits, which are often used for peripheral nerves. In this study, we retrospectively evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a collagen conduit with collagen filaments for RLN reconstruction cases at our hospital.Methods Artificial nerve conduits were used in seven cases of RLN reconstruction. Two patients had preoperative unilateral vocal cord paralysis with severe vocal cord atrophy, and two had vocal cord paresis without atrophy. The remaining three patients had functional vocal cords before surgery that had to be resected via surgery due to thyroid cancer infiltration of the RLN. Reconstruction was performed using RENERVE (R), which is a collagen conduit. Voice examination and laryngeal endoscopy were performed 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery.Results There was no improvement in the phonetics of the two patients with vocal cord atrophy before surgery. In the remaining five cases, three with functional vocal cords improved to preoperative values, and two with vocal cord paresis improved to greater than preoperative values.Conclusion We report the first case series using an artificial nerve conduit for human RLN reconstruction. In cases of RLN resection when the patient has good voice quality pre-operatively, reconstruction of the RLN using an artificial nerve may be a favorable option in cases where direct anastomosis or ansa cervicalis to RLN anastomosis cannot be performed.

Inspired by discursive-psychological and conversation-analytic investigations on experience in interactions, this study approaches experience as a 'loose term' and as a participant's issue in the unfolding sequence of talks. The analysis documents a range of interactional moments wherein experiences are invoked and negotiated over the course of reporting racism in the interviews. The findings align with the existing discursive-psychological and conversation-analytic research on experiences, and provide further evidence on how speakers jointly orient to and manage the issues of who knows and owns an experience, and has the premier authority to claim an experience, in relation to reporting racism. The analysis unveils the intricacy of inquiring and talking about a victim's experience of racism. People's (use of) common sense understanding of the detrimental nature of racism is met and complicated by an orientation to our unlevelled access to an experience of racism, which is a category-based societal problem.

The protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) serves as an oncogene in a myriad of solid tumors, including breast cancer. Hence, the primary aim of the current study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the PRMT6 complex promotes breast cancer progression. The results show that PRMT6, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), and the cullin 4 B (CUL4B)-Ring E3 ligase (CRL4B) complex interact to form a transcription-repressive complex that co-occupies the core clock gene PER3 promoter. Moreover, genome-wide analysis of PRMT6/PARP1/CUL4B targets identifies a cohort of genes that is principally involved in circadian rhythms. This transcriptional-repression complex promotes the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer by interfering with circadian rhythm oscillation. Meanwhile, the PARP1 inhibitor Olaparib enhances clock gene expression, thus, reducing breast carcinogenesis, indicating that PARP1 inhibitors have potential antitumor effects in high-PRMT6 expression breast cancer.

Haloboration of <i>o</i>-Alkynyl Phenols Generates Halogenated Bicyclic-Boronates	ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION			English	Article; Early Access						Benzoxaborinines; Boron; Cyclic-Boronates; Electrophilic Addition; Haloboration	BORYLATION; INSERTION; ESTERS	Benzoxaborinines are intermediates en-route to bicyclic boronates that are important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Herein, the haloboration of o-alkynyl-phenols using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) is disclosed as a route to form C4-X-benzoxaborinines with good functional group tolerance. Computational studies indicated that there are two similar in barrier mechanisms: (i) double alkyne haloboration followed by retro-haloboration; (ii) concerted trans-haloboration involving an exogenous chloride source. The C4-halide in these benzoxaborinines is useful, with a one-pot haloboration-Negishi cross coupling protocol effective to form benzoxaborinines with an alkyl or an aryl at C4. Therefore this method is a useful addition to the toolbox for synthesising bicyclic-boronates that are attracting increasing attention as APIs.

Progressive fibrosing ILD (PF- ILD) may develop in ILD with autoimmune fea-tures. Data on PF- ILDs in ASS as a group are scarce. This study aimed to explore the characteristics and predictors of PF- ILD in ASS patients.Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 96 ASS- ILD patients. Baseline clinical data were collected. PF- ILD assessments were conducted at every hospital visit dur -ing windows of 24 months after initial diagnosis. Phenotypic, survival features and predictors of PF- ILD were estimated through SPSS 22.0.Results: The results revealed that 35.42% (34/96) were evaluated to be PF- ILD with a median interval time of 14.73 months. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia was the most common radiological pattern of PF- ILD. Ground glass opacity (GGO), traction bronchiectasis and reticulation were representative high-resolution computed tomog-raphy findings of this group. Compared with the non-progressive group, PF- ILD pa-tients had higher frequencies of anti- Ro- 52 antibodies (91.18% vs 66.13%, P = 0.007) and GGO in the lower + middle and lower + middle + upper zones of the left lung, as well as lower + middle zones in the right lung (85.30% vs 54.84%, P = 0.003; 64.71% vs 38.71%, P = 0.015; 82.35% vs 58.06%, P = 0.016). Multivariate Cox analysis identi-fied that anti- Ro- 52 antibody (hazards ratio [HR] 3.55, 95% CI 1.06- 11.90, P = 0.040) and GGO in left lower + middle lung zones (HR 22.11, 95% CI 1.95- 250.90, P = 0.012) were independent risk factors for PF- ILD.Conclusions: PF- ILD was associated with poor prognosis. Over one- third of ASS- ILD patients may develop to PF- ILD. Anti- Ro- 52 antibody positivity and GGO in left lower + middle lung zones were independent risk factors for PF- ILD in ASS patients.

However, such anodes still suffer from huge volume change upon repeated Na+ insertion/extraction processes and simultaneously undergo severe shuttle effect of polyselenides, thus leading to poor electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile chemical-blowing and selenization strategy to fabricate 3D interconnected hybrids built from metal selenides (MSe, M = Mn, Co, Cr, Fe, In, Ni, Zn) nanoparticles encapsulated in in situ formed N-doped carbon foams (NCFs) is reported. Such hybrids not only provide ultrasmall active nanobuilding blocks (approximate to 15 nm), but also efficiently anchor them inside the conductive NCFs, thus enabling both high-efficiency utilization of active components and high structural stability. On the other hand, Cu-driven replacement reaction is utilized for efficiently inhibiting the shuttle effect of polyselenides in ether-based electrolyte. Benefiting from the combined merits of the unique MSe@NCFs and the utilization of the conversion of metal selenides to copper selenides, the as-obtained hybrids (MnSe as an example) exhibit superior rate capability (386.6 mAh g(-1) up to 8 A g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability (347.7 mAh g(-1) at 4.0 A g(-1) after 1200 cycles).

Influence of Radial Stiffness Gradients on Porous Composite Bulk Mechanics	ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS			English	Article						3D printing; bioinspired materials; composites; CT; finite element modeling; functionally gradient materials; PolyJet printing	INTERVERTEBRAL DISC; SCAFFOLDS; BONE; BIOMECHANICS	Functionally gradient materials, characterized by a smooth compositional change over space, have gained attention in recent years due to their tunable properties and ability to reduce mechanical stress concentrations. Specifically, attaining high stiffness without compromising toughness is a challenge, as the properties are inversely related. Varying moduli gradients, as seen abundantly in biological materials, do not present this trade-off, facilitating increased rigidity without altering maximum elongation. Herein, the application of stiffness gradients in porous structures is investigated through compressive mechanical testing, computerized tomography imaging, and finite element modeling. Gradients are compared to several alternative designs to investigate the importance of a smooth material transition and increased radial stiffness. All groups are compressed to 50% strain and the pre- and postpore closure modulus, toughness, and dimensional change in the transverse and radial directions are measured. The findings indicate that a mechanical gradient with increasing radial stiffness allows for balance of mechanical integrity and favorable recovery characteristics, crucial for long-lasting performance. Furthermore, the structures with an increasing radial stiffness outperform those with a decreasing radial stiffness in all aspects. The results emphasize the mechanical advantages and optimization potential of a radial stiffness gradient for a wide range of load-bearing applications.	[Abed, Melissa R. R.; Archibeck, Erin S.

Advanced architecture design is applied to many materials, including metal materials, inorganic nonmetallic materials, polymer materials, and so on. To improve the performance of advanced materials, the designed architecture can be enhanced by bionics of biological structure, optimization of structural parameters, and coupling of multiple types of structures. Herein, the progress of structural materials is reviewed, the strengthening mechanisms of different types of structures are highlighted, and the impact of architecture design on the performance of advanced materials is discussed. Architecture design can improve the properties of materials at the micro level, such as mechanical, electrical, and thermal conductivity. The synergistic effect of structure makes traditional materials move toward advanced functional materials, thus enriching the macroproperties of materials. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of structural innovation of advanced materials in improving material properties are discussed.

Lactiplantibacillus plantarum AHQ-14 isolated from the traditional dairy products in Xinjiang Province, China, has good ability to reduce the allergenicity of beta-lactoglobulin (LG) and good probiotic properties. In the presented study, L. plantarum AHQ-14 was used to replace half of the commercial yoghurt starter to ferment yoghurt, and the effects of L. plantarum AHQ-14 fortification on microstructure, textural and rheological attributes of yoghurt were investigated. In addition, milk protein hydrolysis, antigenicity and allergenicity of yoghurts during 28 days of cold storage were detected. The results indicated that AHQ-14 and YC-X11 fermentation could enhance the texture and rheological properties of yoghurt by reducing the syneresis (37%) and firmness (14%) and improving the cohesiveness by 50%. In addition, AHQ-14 and YC-X11 fermentation can shorten the fermentation time by about 30 min, SDS-PAGE displayed that AHQ-14 and YC-X11 fermentation had stronger hydrolysis of whey protein compared with YC-X11 yoghurt. Additionally, the fermentation by L. plantarum AHQ-14 and YC-X11 could significantly reduce the antigenicity and IgE-binding ability of skim milk by 82% and 94%, respectively, thus reducing milk-allergic reactions in patients significantly.
