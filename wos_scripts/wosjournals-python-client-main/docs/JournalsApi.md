Search and filter across JCR Journals

The endpoint allows to search, filter, or browse across the Journals content.  The endpoint doesn't require any parameter to return results, although only main information for the first ten records sorted alphabetically will be retrieved.  To get comprehensive results, a set of parameters could be applied: - `q`: ISSN or title/publisher search - `edition`: filter by journal edition - `categoryCode`: filter by WoS journal category - `jcrYear`: filter by Journal Citation Report Year (since 1997) - `jif`: filter by Journal Impact Factor (JIF) - `jifPercentile`: filter by Journal Impact Factor Percentile (0-100) - `jifQuartile`: filter by Journal Impact Factor Rank Quartile - `jci`: filter by Journal Citation Indicator (JCI) - `limit`: set the limit of records on the page (1-50) - `page`: set the result page  By default, all the responses are sorted alphabetically, only in case of search the results will be sorted by relevance.  The response contains: - Main information about the number of records found, page and limit - Journals unique ID (based on JCR abbreviated title) - API Link to Journal record - Journal title - Search matches with the found phrase ***&lt;em&gt;*** *highlighted* ***&lt;/em&gt;*** - only if parameter `q` is requested - Category information (unique ID, category name, and edition) - only if the parameter `categoryCode` or `edition` is requested - Link to the Journal Citation Report - only if parameter `jcrYear` is requested - Metrics information (Impact metrics) - only if parameter `jif` or `jci` is requested - Metrics information (Source metrics) - only if parameter `jifPercentile` is requested - Ranks information (JIF rank and quartile within the category) - only if parameter `jifQuartile` is requested

# **journals_id_cited_year_year_get**
> JournalsCited journals_id_cited_year_year_get(id, year)

Get journals that cite the journal for the JCR year

Cited Journal data show how many citations a journal received in the JCR year. Cited journal data is relevant when analyzing metrics such as the Journal Impact Factor and Market Share.  The response contains:  - Citing **Journal** with the link to WoS Journal API entity - **Cited Year (all)**:  The total number of citations from the citing journal. This total includes the number shown under each year and the number in the Rest column. - **Cited Year (10 years interval)**: Publication year of the cited articles. - **Cited Year (rest)**: All publication years of cited articles prior to the 10-year period defined by the table. For example, if the cited years shown are 2017-2008, the Rest column will show the number of citations from the citing journal in 2017 to articles published in the cited journal in 2007 and any earlier year.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (key):

```python
import time
import clarivate.wos_journals.client
from clarivate.wos_journals.client.api import journals_api
from clarivate.wos_journals.client.model.journal_reports import JournalReports
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.clarivate.com/apis/wos-journals/v1
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = clarivate.wos_journals.client.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.clarivate.com/apis/wos-journals/v1"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: key
configuration.api_key['key'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['key'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with clarivate.wos_journals.client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = journals_api.JournalsApi(api_client)
    id = "PLOS_ONE" # str | Journal unique identifier  Currently an identifier is a JCR abbreviation, where blank spaces are substituted with underscores (e.g. *PLOS ONE* Journal has the ID **PLOS_ONE**)
    year = 2017 # int | Journal Citation Report year (jcrYear)

    # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
    try:
        # Get journal metrics for a year
        api_response = api_instance.journals_id_reports_year_year_get(id, year)
        pprint(api_response)
    except clarivate.wos_journals.client.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling JournalsApi->journals_id_reports_year_year_get: %s\n" % e)
```
